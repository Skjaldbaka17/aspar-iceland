{"L'Wren Scott":["I believe in stopping work and eating lunch.","Guys understand a waistline. They understand a silhouette.","You'll see the most perfect person, and you are like, 'God, she's, like, perfect.' And then she'll tell you everything that's not perfect. Everyone has their own special set of problems - in their own minds.","My entertainment was going to the local dollar movie theatre on the weekend, where I watched old black and white movies. If you wanted current movies, you had to drive to the big city.","My theory is that balance is key - nothing in excess.","It was always sort of my dream to make handbags and I wanted a handbag that was very sharp, very structured, very tailored... I wanted a bag you could put all of your things in it, you can open it, you could close it, you could hid all your tricks, but it's not all lumpy.","Random things are luxurious to people. It's personal.","Enhancing a woman's silhouette and enhancing a woman's beauty - both contribute to enhancing her confidence, so they're synonymous, really.","I think everyone evolves over the years, but I have always had the silhouette that I know suits me. I am never going to wear a frothy, poufy thing that sticks out because I have found a style that works for me, and I stick with it.","When you're creating a fragrance, you're always thinking about what you want that first smell to be, that first reaction. It's a sensation, like a symphony with all of those layers and notes. I love the way it changes and the way it dries down. The fun thing about scent is that it's unique to everyone; pheromones take on a new scent.","I like a very sexy silhouette, and I like to feel like when you put something on, you zip yourself into it, and you're secure in there.","I dress for men.","There's lots of things you pull out lipstick for.","I take a multivitamin, vitamin D, and omega-3 oils every day, and if I'm stressed or run- down, I bulk up on vitamin C and zinc.","Everyone has their own special set of problems - in their own minds.","One should always try to do the best you possibly can. I'm not in a race to the finish line - I won't put anything out until it's completely ready. You want to keep it special and unique for the customer.","Everyone has this perception that the bloggers, they say horrible things about you and they hide behind their computers where you can't see them.","I've always been very inspired by fashion. I've always been a big fan of style.","You always have to think in a new modern way, and you always have to push yourself in fashion because it's a big treadmill. You can't really get off it. You just have to move a little faster.","I am a fashion designer, so I guess that makes me an overpacker.","Peruvian food is so simple yet amazingly flavored with their traditional spices.","I love a real-life, movie moment in living color.","I never eat where the hotel recommends. I do my own research and then try the most highly rated options.","I am only six foot three, by the way.","The biggest part of my fashion choices is how comfortable it is.","People often try to disguise televisions. I always think that makes it worse. It is what it is!","In the future, I'd like to make jewelry and sell it under my own name. But right now, I've got enough on my plate!","I'm always working. I work wherever I am.","Every season I try to top myself, and push it a little further.","Women of every age and size really just want to look sexy, while retaining their power and dignity.","I have a very big family and a lot of friends, and buying presents is one of my favorite things to do.","I exercise five days a week at home.","I had to learn to sew when I was growing up, because nothing else fitted me.","I didn't particularly like being objectified.","You can celebrate the female form in comfort. We left corsets behind in the dark ages, so why bring them back now?","I've never met a woman who thinks they've got a good enough figure - however perfect they look - which is sad, because no one else can see these perceived flaws; they're entirely internal.","It's so important your customer can rely on you for your classics.","I don't like to dictate the style to the customer, I believe people give something their own trend.","If you don't feel good in it, don't wear it. Because it'll never look good. Any hesitation in the fitting room and just walk away.","After working with clothes for so long, it seemed right to design them.","Luxury is a state of mind.","I am obsessed with proportion, and how proportion is perceived.","I'm always trying to find something new for my customers. Every season, I try to top myself and push it a little further.","I usually build my collections on colors and on staples, so when you buy pieces, you are really adding to your wardrobe, and you're getting a new color palette to play with. The clothes are timeless and modern at the same time.","I've worked with lots of musicians - like Tina Turner - and I love when they go in front of the fitting mirror and do their thing, pose, dance. I love that moment!","I grew up listening to Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf and lots of blues, R&B and Motown.","You can't believe everything you read. I am only six foot three, by the way.","Guys understand a waistline. They understand a silhouette. I dress for men.","The first thing I do in the morning is take my vitamins. I don't want to say which vitamins; I don't think you should push what you believe in. Doctors should do that, not fashion designers.","I don't have time to be that girl who does the super workout. But I try to be as fit as possible, given my schedule. Even if I do 20 minutes a day, it's better than nothing.","I think a girl always needs a cardigan, and I tend to go for the sparkles. I have a minimum of 50 embellished cardigans. I'm not a believer in less is more; I'm sort of a believer in more is necessary.","Sometimes I like to watch TV, though I never get to watch any of the shows in real time. I'm a fan of 'Downton Abbey,' 'Boardwalk Empire,' and 'Boss.' There's a British series called 'Luther,' but in England, they think a series means four episodes. And I like 'Mad Men.' Otherwise, it's always good to unwind with a book.","Although my mother didn't necessarily approve of teenage girls wearing heels, she made an exception for me when I was 14 because she didn't want me to be self-conscious about my height - or to slouch.","Even though education was key in my family, I had no access to museums or art where we lived. I was a bit starved.","I was worried that in London I would be judged for who I know rather than what I do. In New York, I am known for fashion.","What resonates culturally with me about Japanese style is that it is very covered up but very sensual.","I love seeing women looking great in my clothes. I don't care who they are. I don't quantify people by celebrity.","I love to see women who are comfortable in their skin and dress to suit their body - that looks fabulous because it's authentic.","You don't need to wear Spanx if you buy my clothes. The dress, the trousers, the pencil skirt - they should do the work.","Weirdly, my nickname was Lady. I didn't get Stretch, or Stilts, or Spider Legs - I got Lady. I guess I was always a bit ladylike.","The modern woman has a modern life, and most of us work. There's no time to change before we go out in the evening, so a dress should always look appropriate for day and night.","Everyone's curves fall in a different place. But you can't put something of mine on and not see curves.","I was so tall and so skinny - I was that kid who couldn't find anything to wear. All the cool kids would have jeans the right length and I would just think, 'What am I going to do?'","I wanted to create things that you can always pull out of your closet and rely on. I wanted to create a timeless, classic collection of clothing that you can keep expanding on.","If you don't feel good in it, don't wear it, because you'll never look good.","When I designed my first house in L.A., I didn't have any money - I did it all on my own. I liked that.","I don't think I realized the extremes of my proportions until I moved to Paris. I thought I'd be 'normal' as a model, but actually, even in that world, I was at one end of the spectrum.","I'm not an easy customer. My attention to detail could probably drive you mad. My eye still always goes toward the single flaw.","I love an iPad game of Scrabble.","I don't really measure success by anything other than if I am happy. That is success to me. Am I happy waking up every morning? And despite the challenges of running my own business, do I look forward to going to work? Absolutely.","I always have to have my lipstick. Sometimes I have more than one shade: start with one color for the morning, one for night. Sometimes I have a couple shades just in case I need something more powerful for the day.","I like talking one-on-one to everyone. I find it really sort of cathartic and interesting to hear people's opinions.","I just want to be known for what I do, not who I know.","When a garment is in sync with your body and its proportions, it looks and feels amazing, and in France that is something that all women know from a young age.","As a designer, when someone wears my clothes, the biggest compliment I can receive is that the woman looks amazing because my designs have flattered her, not taken over her. I take that philosophy to heart myself each morning when I am getting ready for the day.","I'm a fashion designer. I don't want to be defined as someone's girlfriend."],"L. E. Modesitt, Jr.":["If I recall correctly, I think I signed my first contract with Tor in 1983.","Science fiction writers have usually been very poor prognosticators of the future, either in literary or technological terms, and that's because we're all too human and, I think, have the tendency to see what we want to or, in the case of those more paranoid, what we fear.","When I was in my late twenties, a friend suggested that, since I was an avid SF reader and had been since I was barely a teenager, that since it didn't look like the poetry was going where I wanted, I might try writing a science fiction story. I did, and the first story I ever wrote was 'The Great American Economy.'","My experiences in the military, the private sector, and as a congressional staffer were at times almost enough to drive me crazy. Writing offered the all-too-often-cited creative outlet.","I've often said that there's no one thing that I do or have done that is particularly unique. There have been a lot of other authors who were in the military. There have been a few others who were pilots. There have certainly been a lot of other people who were in politics or served congressional staffs.","'The One-Eyed Man' is a novel that was one I never intended to write.","I started writing poetry in high school because I wanted desperately to write, but somehow, writing stories didn't appeal to me, and I loved the flow and the feel and sense of poetry, especially that of what one might call formal verse.","I actually started out as a poet in high school. I published in small literary magazines for probably about ten years. I entered the Yale Younger Poet contest every year, until I was too old to be a younger poet, and I never got more than a form rejection letter from them.","I'm not sure there are too many people who write what I write.","I only did about one novel a year while I was working full time, but since 1993, I've averaged two and a half books a year.","According to my royalty statements, 'The Green Progression' sold 392 copies in hardcover."],"L. Frank Baum":["Whenever I feel blue, I start breathing again.","Imagination has brought mankind through the dark ages to its present state of civilization. Imagination led Columbus to discover America. Imagination led Franklin to discover electricity.","I can't give you a brain, but I can give you a diploma.","The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick.","Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable.","I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore."],"L. J. Smith":["I like strong female characters. I try to write them as role models for young girls.","'Shadow Souls' pushes probably every border that you can.","I don't know how to make Harper and Alloy want me, not just my name.","I've thought that 'Soulmate' in the 'Night World' series would make a really nice TV-movie or just a movie."],"L. Lionel Kendrick":["We cannot always control everything that happens to us in this life, but we can control how we respond. Many struggles come as problems and pressures that sometimes cause pain. Others come as temptations, trials, and tribulations.","Life is not always easy to live, but the opportunity to do so is a blessing beyond comprehension. In the process of living, we will face struggles, many of which will cause us to suffer and to experience pain.","The temple is a place of worship. Reverence is a supernal form of worship. It is the form of worship found in the celestial kingdom.","We are accountable for our actions as we exercise our moral agency. If we understand this principle and make righteous choices, our lives will be blessed.","The temple and the holy ordinances are indeed sacred, and we should be spiritually sensitive to them. It is a sacred blessing to attend the temple to worship the Lord.","Our Heavenly Father continues to communicate with us through revelation. These revelations are communications of divine directions. They may come to us personally or through the voice of the Lord's chosen servants, the prophets, seers, and revelators.","We should always remember that it is by His invitation that we come to His holy house, the temple of the Lord. We should respond to His invitation by being worthy, by being prepared, and by having the temple as a priority in our lives. While in the temple we should act as if we are in His holy presence.","Our communications reflect in our countenance. Therefore, we must be careful not only what we communicate, but also how we do so. Souls can be strengthened or shattered by the message and the manner in which we communicate.","Christlike communications are expressions of affection and not anger, truth and not fabrication, compassion and not contention, respect and not ridicule, counsel and not criticism, correction and not condemnation. They are spoken with clarity and not with confusion. They may be tender or they may be tough, but they must always be tempered.","Christlike communications are expressed in tones of love rather than loudness. They are intended to be helpful rather than hurtful. They tend to bind us together rather than to drive us apart. They tend to build rather than to belittle.","There are no soft or slothful ways to become sanctified to the point that we are prepared to live in the presence of the Savior. And there can be blessings in the burdens we bear. As a result of these struggles, our souls are stretched and our spirits are strengthened. Our character becomes more Christlike as we are tried and tested.","One of the marvelous blessings of the Book of Mormon is that it contains, in clarity, revelations reserved to come forth in this dispensation of time. Much of the knowledge that we have relating to the principle of moral agency is found in these modern revelations.","To properly prepare to receive personal revelation, we must repent, ask through prayer, be obedient, search the scriptures, fast, think pure thoughts, and develop a spirit of reverence.","The Spirit of the Holy Ghost is the teacher in the temple. He teaches principles of eternal significance. It is during these instructions that we see the relationship between the earthly and the eternal. We must remember that the Spirit teaches only those who are teachable.","To gain strength in our struggles, we must have a positive perspective of the principles in the plan of salvation. We must realize that we have a personal Savior whom we can trust and turn to in our times of need.","Heavenly Father has given us a priceless gift in our capacity to communicate with each other. Our communications are at the core of our relationships with others. If we are to return home safely to Heavenly Father, we must develop righteous relationships with His children here in mortality.","To be reverent is not just to be quiet. It involves an awareness of what is taking place. It involves a divine desire to learn and to be receptive to the promptings of the Spirit. It involves a striving to seek added light and knowledge.","It is inappropriate to discuss matters of business, pleasure or current events in the temple.","Scriptures reveal the divine desires of the Lord in our behalf. Each of us should have a burning desire to search the scriptures diligently and daily to seek the will of the Lord in our life. For some, it may be necessary to develop the discipline to search the scriptures daily.","The real challenge that we face in our communications with others is to condition our hearts to have Christlike feelings for all of Heavenly Father's children. When we develop this concern for the condition of others, we then will communicate with them as the Savior would.","Receiving personal revelation is not a passive process. As we seek such revelations, we must prepare for these sacred experiences.","To pray is to have a conversation with Deity. This sacred and supernal communication with Heavenly Father is a divine and delicate process. This crucial communication should be conducted with great care and in compliance with sacred counsel.","Irreverence not only shows disrespect to Deity but also makes it hard for the Spirit to teach us the things we need to know.","Integrity is the core of our character. Without integrity, we have a weak foundation upon which to build other Christlike characteristics.","I have enjoyed every call. The ones involving direct contact with people have been most rewarding.","Wise choices can put us in control of situations where we might otherwise be tempted to compromise our principles. We cannot control all that happens to us; however, we can choose to be in control of our responses.","At times, our circumstances call for us to make critical choices to keep our covenants or to compromise them. Covenants should never be compromised, even when at the moment some circumstances might seem to justify it.","Some have suffered death to make it possible for us to have the scriptures today. Historically, the scriptures in the Bible were reserved for the clergy, with the reading of them by others being denounced. At times, laws even prohibited the public or private reading of them.","One of the most sacred purposes for which the scriptures were written was to make it possible for all to know Christ. The scriptures teach and testify of Jesus Christ. They teach us much that we need to know and to do to return to the presence of the Savior.","May we treasure the divine gift of communication, and may we use it wisely to build and to assist others on this marvelous journey through mortality."],"L. Neil Smith":["We are expected to believe that anyone who objects to the Department of Homeland Security or the USA Patriot Act is a terrorist, and that the only way to preserve our freedom is to hand it over to the government for safekeeping.","People in the mass media tend more and more every day to look and act like elected and appointed officials.","What happened in America in the 1860s was a war of secession, a war of independence, no different in principle from what happened in America in the 1770s and 1780s.","I propose a Constitutional Amendment providing that, if any public official, elected or appointed, at any level of government, is caught lying to any member of the public for any reason, the punishment shall be death by public hanging.","I'm tired of being lied to by government, by the media, and by every corporation I have anything to do with.","The main problem is that for a boycott to be effective, you must first persuade thousands - maybe even millions of others - to go along, which is a lot of work and usually not successful.","Government is waging war against the people.","Collective states are constitutionally incapable of reliably producing anything but corpses.","It's often been observed that the first casualty of war is the truth. But that's a lie, too, in its way. The reality is that, for most wars to begin, the truth has to have been sacrificed a long time in advance.","Lincoln emancipated nobody. The man freed not a single slave.","A libertarian presidential candidate isn't going to win anyway, so he can afford to say that all taxation is theft, and it isn't the job of a libertarian presidential candidate to cook up new ways to commit theft.","The War on Drugs employs millions - politicians, bureaucrats, policemen, and now the military - that probably couldn't find a place for their dubious talents in a free market, unless they were to sell pencils from a tin cup on street corners.","The claim that the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were attacked because fundamentalists hate our prosperity and freedom is a ridiculous lie.","I'm tired of living in a police state.","Violent crime is a solved problem - all they have to do is repeal the laws that keep those intelligent, capable, and responsible men and women from arming themselves, and violent crime evaporates like dry ice on a hot summer day.","Today, human civilization is drowning in a sea of lies.","I'll remind you all, however, that for government, existence is a privilege, not a right.","We must oppose programs that would take food from the mouths of younger generations to buy prescription drugs for old people, and we must do it... for the children.","City governments ought to be abolished, if only as a public health measure.","As to the media, they are protected by the First Amendment, as they should be.","It is individuals who must be encouraged to undertake the unprecedented - and unprecedentedly profitable - effort to prevent the annihilation of the human race.","This planet is 15 million years overdue for an asteroid strike like the one that killed the dinosaurs.","I'm tired of being considered some kind of criminal or dangerous throwback for no other reason than that I value, exercise, and defend my rights under the first ten Amendments to the United States Constitution.","I'm tired of being considered property.","I'm as radical as libertarians come.","The first thing you need to know, in order to establish some perspective and avoid panic, is that the violent government excesses we're seeing today are far from unprecedented.","Beloved friends and comrades... the national Libertarian Party is dead.","The fact is that surveys which media people openly admit to show that fewer than twelve percent of their customers believe they're doing a good job, while the average profit margin in television is in the neighborhood of eighty percent.","Poverty is a solved problem - all they have to do is abolish taxes and regulations which cripple those intelligent, capable, and responsible men and women and destroy their productive capacity, then stand back and watch the economy boom.","As a novelist, I have a somewhat higher soapbox to stand on than most people do when it comes to talking back to the merchants of fear."],"L. Ron Hubbard":["Never regret yesterday. Life is in you today and you make your tomorrow.","Well I don't know that I'm okay any more than anyone else is okay, I lead a happy life and a very full one - I have a happy marriage and my kids are all cheerful, and no one is finding fault with me, personally.","When a culture has fallen totally away from spiritual pursuits into materialism, one must begin by demonstrating they are each a soul, not a material animal.","One of the ways you learn about life is to associate with people.","I am a writer of the textbooks of scientology.","Let me clarify this very definitely. This is not an authoritarian organization.","You don't have a soul; you are your own soul. In other words, you are not this book, your social security card, your body, or your mind. You are you.","Scientology is the study of knowingness. It increases one's knowingness, but if a man were totally aware of what was going on around him, he would find it relatively simple to handle any outnesses in that.","I have seen life from the top down and the bottom up. I know how it looks both ways. And I know there is wisdom and that there is hope.","A man is as alive as he can communicate.","The mind when it has an old experience will add that data into its current experience, and it keeps coming up with wrong answers.","A science is something which is constructed from truth on workable axioms. There are 55 axioms in scientology which are very demonstrably true, and on these can be constructed a great deal.","If there is an authoritarian structure at St. Hill it has been brought into being by the government itself. St. Hill is trying to correct itself. It doesn't know what it's trying to correct because nobody has told it what to correct.","Oh yes, as a matter of fact it is quite interesting that exercises can be conducted which demonstrate conclusively that there are memories which exist prior to this life.","A suppressing person isn't critical. A suppressing person is a person who denies the rights of others.","I am studying ancient civilizations, trying to find what happened to them, finding out why they went into a decline, why they died.","One tends to overlook the fact that all during the 30's and actually during the late 40's I was a highly successful writer and a great many properties accumulated during that period of time.","There were very, very large sums of money that I made when I was very young - 15 million published works and a great many successful movies don't make nothin'."],"L. Sprague de Camp":["In writing a series of stories about the same characters, plan the whole series in advance in some detail, to avoid contradictions and inconsistencies.","It does not pay a prophet to be too specific.","There is no mistaking the dismay on the face of a writer who has just heard that his brain child is a deformed idiot.","The story of civilization is, in a sense, the story of engineering - that long and arduous struggle to make the forces of nature work for man's good."],"L. Wolfe Gilbert":["Those who find beauty in all of nature will find themselves at one with the secrets of life itself.","Perchance the chemist is already damned and the guardian the blackest."],"L.A. Reid":["World events can shape culture. Music is either a soundtrack for or a narration of changing times. And who knows how that's going to go?","I live for opening doors for the young generation of creators. If we do nothing else with our success, let's open up some doors.","You always have to know when to bow out. You bow out while you are on top.","Listen, we're still selling stardom. That doesn't go away because MTV decides they can't play videos or they want to program themselves more as a traditional T.V. station. Vevo and YouTube are like MTV online, and on demand.","I am a record executive and I shall be right there in your face with my records.","I'm not a good Samaritan, I'm a businessman... The goal is to read and react. If we sign an artist that has potential for a shelf life way out in the distance, then we'll stay. But if not, then we won't.","I think of myself as a producer who tries to bring the best out of everyone, whether that be an artist, songwriter or a publicist.","I'm one of those foolish people who believe the glory days of the record industry aren't behind us. They're actually ahead of us.","I'm personally looking for artists that are along the lines of today's pop stars. Whether it be a Rihanna or a Justin Bieber or a Kanye West or a Beyonce or a Lady Gaga, I'm looking for talent that's like that, that's what I love.","I was a James Brown junkie as a kid.","The kids I talk to are convinced their generation will make the best music. And the greatest artists have yet to be discovered. I walk around with that thought every day.","Popular music has always been rooted in the blues, whether it's Adele or Led Zeppelin or Sam Cooke. It's just the beat that changes.","We don't sign an artist to fill a void, ever. I'll never find a Taylor Swift. You can't find a new Madonna, you cannot find a Prince, a Bob Marley, a John Lennon. You won't find another Kanye West. We simply deal with people as they walk in, and we say we either love them or we don't.","The deepest and most sincere feeling I get is when I meet an artist and they have that steel in their eyes and they have that fire and that passion and all they want is to be a star and to hear themselves on the radio."],"L.A. Weatherly":["'Harry Potter' made it cool to read children's fiction, and 'Twilight' did the same for a slightly older age group. What I'm seeing is mothers and daughters who love to read the same books.","There's always that discussion about fiction about how do you market it - these are books for boys, these are books for girls, these are books for adults. Actually, they're just stories, and if they're good stories, then they surpass those boundaries.","It's funny, because readers think they want the characters to be blissfully happy, but it makes it kind of boring for the reader."],"LL Cool J":["Stay focused, go after your dreams and keep moving toward your goals.","When adversity strikes, that's when you have to be the most calm. Take a step back, stay strong, stay grounded and press on.","I think fitness is important. I think a healthy lifestyle is important. I think putting positive energy out there is important and just staying connected with the people.","Once you achieve one goal, you should be looking forward to trying to build onto the next thing, and not just getting comfortable with what you're doing.","Stand up and face your fears, or they will defeat you.","Sometimes you've just got to grab an apple - or grapes, or strawberries. Something that's healthy but maybe a little bit more adventurous, if you can see fruit as adventurous.","I'm not trying to be new school and I'm not old school - I'm classic. There's a lot of new cars and there's a lot of old cars, but I'm just classic in doing what I do.","I am what I am, I'm doing very well in my life, and I'm thankful to God for that.","You have to always continue to strive no matter how hard things get, no matter how troubled you feel. No matter how tough things get, no matter how many times you lose, you keep trying to win.","Our world is at the crossroads. We have a choice, right and wrong.","If you do cardio one day and the next day you can do weights, do it that way. If you need to do it at night or in the morning, do it that way. Whatever you need to get it done, just get it done.","Do what you love; you'll be better at it. It sounds pretty simple, but you'd be surprised how many people don't get this one right away.","Dreams don't have deadlines. I'm thinking of doing bigger and better things and having more fun with it.","I do about 90 percent of my own stunts, and the things I can't do for insurance reasons, like swinging out of a flying helicopter, I wouldn't want to do anyway.","I think when you move past your fear and you go after your dreams wholeheartedly, you become free. Know what I'm saying? Move past the fear.","You've got to stay focused without being boring - because all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Skinny, but dull.","I just look at the high and bright side of things.","Nobody is perfect, but life is about choices.","I'm not trying to keep up or adapt. I'm allowing myself to grow, evolve and create new music.","I don't have an image that I'm trying to, like, portray. I'm just being me.","I try to do the right thing with money. Save a dollar here and there, clip some coupons. Buy ten gold chains instead of 20. Four summer homes instead of eight.","I'm a real person that cares about his art and cares about what he's doing. I have a heart and a soul and I want to touch people and give.","You can't let your past hold your future hostage.","I only do what comes from the heart.","Hip-hop's always reached out to kids. If you look at the last 10 big albums it might seem ironic. But when I look at the history of this music it's always had a lot of positivity.","Art is about imagination. When you look at a picture from Salvador Dali, that's about imagination. When you look at Picasso, that's about imagination. Doing stuff from your heart.","I think the guy who has had the better films is Will Smith. I don't know if he's a better actor than me. I don't think so. I am a rapper first. Man, I just love what I do. I am just the greatest and I can't help it. I'm sorry man.","I don't think you should go around talking trash about people because I think that's how you get your hat handed to you.","I've got to see my movie to see how I'm acting, see what little things I can learn about my craft.","The nature of the game is pain.","I don't look back. I don't live my life in the rear-view mirror because, if you do, you're bound to end up wrapped around a pole somewhere.","I love my fans, I love my music - I have no reason to retire.","I think when you move past your fear and you go after your dreams wholeheartedly, you become free.","We're going to raise a lot of money for cancer awareness, give some to the American Cancer Society and hopefully make a big difference.","People will feel the way they feel.","Sometimes altering your position is the right thing. Sometimes it's not.","What I like to do is just make good music, good movies, hopefully perform a good show full of energy and just have some fun.","As a black man, my hope is that I can touch more and more people all over the world of different races and different colours.","I am a real person that cares about his art and cares about what he's doing - I have a heart and a soul and want to touch people and give.","I'm good at what I do, but I wouldn't be so bold and arrogant as to say something disrespectful about, say, Eminem. He's talented and he's good at what he does.","I was listening to Jimi Hendrix; I just admire his artistry and creativity as an artist.","I'm not just a rapper. I'm an entertainer. That's the difference.","That's one of the good things about music. You get to do it live, where you can touch the people and interact with them.","Hip-hop can be limiting and I refuse to accept limits.","I think I'm the best, of course. How could I not?","There's a lot of single black women who did the best that they could and that's a beautiful thing, but they don't know how necessary a father is in a kid's life and how much guys miss that deep down inside.","Once the referee throws the ball in the air, it's either your ball or their ball and you have to just take your shot.","I'm not giving up my history and what I've done in my music because I love it and I'm very proud of it. I just want to open it up for more people.","I think that politics could be a positive thing. My beef is that people focus on the personal aspect of a politician too much. They should focus on the results.","I just like to do different things. What is more important than the name is that people know that I really like acting, I enjoy it and I want people to know that I am serious.","I feel like my peers now are artists like Madonna and the Stones, Michael Jackson and Prince. These are people who were able to take their careers beyond the normal here-today-gone-tomorrow life span.","What I don't do is try to like become whoever I'm rapping with. The people who go get an LL album want to hear LL.","I've never been one to have to manipulate women. I always want it to be like a mutual thing, like everybody loves everybody.","The secret to it all is just to enjoy what you're doing. This is not working at the coal face, this is not sweeping behind a restaurant. It's work, but it's not work. It gives me a different type of energy. I'm grateful for that.","You don't need to be the good guy to get a good message out.","At fourteen, I started sending out demo tapes.","I am artistic so I reserve the right to change my mind at any point. I just like to do different things. What is more important than the name is that people know that I really like acting, I enjoy it and I want people to know that I am serious.","The people who go get an LL album want to hear LL. They don't want to hear LL trying to sound like DMX or whoever else is out there. That's not what they want to hear from me, because if they want to hear that they can go get the real thing.","I don't wanna abandon my identity as LL Cool J, but at the same time, I had to figure out how to let people know that I'm really serious about making these movies.","I've been training as an actor for six years. Nobody goes to acting school for six years. I mean, the college course is only four years! I absolutely trained.","The person that made me want to make movies, and the reason I do films, is Bruce Lee. He was an incredible actor, and he had a lot of charisma. Handsome, action, you know, everything was there. I loved Bruce Lee.","I think in order to keep America great, we have to keep America creative.","We need to make sure that there's art in the school. Why? Why should art be in the school? Because if art isn't in a school, then a guy like Steve Jobs doesn't get a chance to really express himself because in order for art to meet technology, you need art.","To know the rules of the game, you have to be educated.","Timing has a lot to with art.","What is more important than the name is that people know that I really like acting, I enjoy it and I want people to know that I am serious. The name thing: I will always be L.L. Cool J.","I think the key to working out is for people to think of water - just allow the workouts to fill out the cracks in your lives and seep into wherever you can fit it in.","Let me tell you something - compared to a TV-drama production schedule, touring is not strenuous.","What I say on a record and what I say off a record is two different things. And that's always been the case. There's a difference between confidence on a record and arrogance.","To me, my peers are Bruce Springsteen and Mick Jagger. I'm not talking age-wise, but in terms of careers. Madonna. Those are my peers. And I'm okay with that.","What you do in your art - TV, music, film stuff - touches people. And they want to touch you. So that's a blessing. I'm okay with it.","I think the stuff that plays on the radio, the majority of it is for teenagers, which is okay. That's what pop radio is about. And some of it is great, and some of it is not.","God blesses us all with different views and perspectives and levels of influence and power."],"LZ Granderson":["Complete strangers can stand silent next to each other in an elevator and not even look each other in the eye. But at a concert, those same strangers could find themselves dancing and singing together like best friends. That's the power of music.","Some of us have become so addicted to pointing fingers at others for all the wrong that happens in our lives that self-assessment has become synonymous with blaming the victim.","Teachers are not glorified babysitters with summers off. Their profession fuels all others, and on a normal day that is amazing enough in and of itself.","Heroes aren't supposed to do bad things. That's what villains are for. So either the good supersedes the bad, or the bad makes it impossible to remember the good. We don't like it when such duality exists in one person. We don't want to know our heroes are human.","As a parent, I can empathize with how difficult raising children can be. There are challenges, especially within the framework of divorce, when parental guilt can sometimes blur what should be the best decision.","Sure, the job of high school teachers is not to tear down students' self-esteem. But it's certainly not to inflate students' sense of self-worth with a bunch of unearned compliments and half-truths.","The ugly truth is it's the spineless parents who parade their undisciplined children around like royalty that make people dislike kids.","Women may think men have it all, but only because we've been socialized to express the emotions that are tied to this reality differently, which is to say, men are not to express the emotions that are tied to it.","I don't claim to know everything about parenting, but I do know parents do their children a disservice by constantly sugarcoating their shortcomings to protect their feelings.","Personal style isn't simply an exercise in parroting but rather an exhibition for our own stories - from the gait of our walk to the rhythm of our speech to the manner in which the necktie falls from the knot.","My mother can certainly be rough around the edges at times, but she also taught me to have compassion for people who have been wronged. She taught me to empathize with those who have made mistakes.","It seems everyone knows a college degree is important, but few have a plan to keep it affordable.","As a newspaper reporter, I covered and was around a fair number of crime scenes involving juvenile delinquents, and few things bothered me more than listening to their parents. Crying, ranting, proclaiming how great their children were despite being kicked out of school or previous run-ins with the law.","Children may be born angels, but with all the temptations out there in the world, it takes work to try to keep them that way.","Parents are supposed to instill a sense of right and wrong in their children and then keep up the due diligence necessary to make sure they don't veer off that path.","Of all the parts that make up my somewhat quirky life, there are few things that raise a stranger's eyebrows faster than discovering I love country music.","Believe me, I recognize the cultural and anatomical challenges and respect the sacrifices women make in order to balance family and a career, or family with no career, or career with no family.","Instead of this fruitless debate about having it all, men and women should focus on what make us happy. Instead of comparing our lives with people we don't know who are making sacrifices we don't see, we should try to find the right balance between home and work life.","There is no way to physically always be there for your children and always be at the office and always be present for your significant other and then take care of yourself. The laws of physics necessitate that somebody or some thing is going to get the short end of the stick.","I haven't dunked since Bill Clinton was in office, so I'm just happy for anyone who can do so without a trampoline.","Most remember the groundbreaking first in sports; few remember the third or fourth to follow in those tracks. That's not downplaying anyone's achievements but rather recognizing that there comes a time when simply being there is no longer good enough for the record books.","My son was born during my last semester in college. His due date was Thanksgiving, but he didn't show up until finals week. I brought my books to the hospital and didn't think anything of it. That is what a father is supposed to do.","Just because we want our favorite team to win does not mean there's any lack of toughness when a player chooses family first.","I don't begrudge a coach for trying to get all that he or she can. I don't resent a school feeling it needs to pay to keep top talent. I'm just afraid to think where all of this will end up because the overall impact seems to be stretching far beyond the scoreboard.","I'm all for holding each other accountable, but it feels as if we're hurling toward a society of finger-pointers, because we don't hold ourselves accountable for anything.","If children can't handle competition when it's necessary, or take some criticism, or never strive to be better because their parents inadvertently programmed them to believe they are already the best even when they're not, then they are in for some serious shocks and bumps down the road.","Accolades and lists may tell us about accomplishments, but life is meant to be experienced, not just accomplished. It's like the difference between reading books for the sake of reading and reading books just to get a good grade.","Growing up, I didn't know anything about money other than we didn't have any.","You know for years, I've heard financial experts stress the importance of teaching your kids about money, but it wasn't until I saw my own son's perspective change that I became a true believer.","With technology and social media and citizen journalism, every rock that used to go unturned is now being flipped, lit and put on TV.","Children are wonderful, but they are not the center of the universe. The sooner their parents make them understand that, the better off we all will be.","We're so preoccupied with protecting children from disappointment and discomfort that we're inadvertently excusing them from growing up.","The more time we invest imitating others, the less that's available to discover and be ourselves.","Insecurity is a natural part of human nature, and there are times we feel our stories are not worth telling, so we turn to the people we admire for strength. If we dress like someone everyone thinks is cool, perhaps we'll be seen as cool.","The Dr. King holiday is not just for black people, African-Americans or people of African descent.","It only takes 140 characters to toss one's character out the window.","There is no shame in black athletes not wanting to be role models, but there should be shame when they don't behave like one. It's a free country and people can do whatever they want. But just because we can doesn't mean we should."],"La India":["I fight manic-depression, and I have been able to live battling that sadness that I get sometimes.","I told God, 'I don't want a man. I don't want more gold albums. The only thing I want is the love, friendship, and presence of my mother.' And God gave it to me.","At 14 and 15, I used to listen to Tito Puente, Dave Valentine and everything that was happening with American jazz. I love it.","My style of singing is very much Latin jazz meets Latin and a little bit of rhythm and blues. When I do ballads, my fans love it. They want to listen to my classics. They want to party.","In my music and my life, I'm honest with my feelings, and people appreciate that. That's just the way I am.","Women see me as a figure they can respect. They know I've been through a lot. I'm not going to let no man put me under.","Women in salsa - women everywhere - we always gotta be defending ourselves.","I don't do anything just 'cause nothing else is happening, or for money.","Watching Madonna puffing on a cigar on David Letterman's show, I thought, 'Gosh, she's feeling so India! All she needs is long, black hair and a trip to the Caribbean to burn her skin up.'","There's so many other things I want to do. I don't want to do them to be different or just for a challenge, but because my heart and soul tell me to.","Many women, sometime in their life, are going to get to a point where they have to admit infidelity.","I used to be so embarrassed by salsa; I wasn't into it.","I won't sing if I don't feel it, so there's always so much sadness and so much sentiment behind it all.","I try to stay real with my thoughts and the things that I go through in life. I like being free.","From 1997 through 1999, I had gained so much. People don't realize how something like weight gain can make you sad. Losing weight has changed my life. If you can take control of your life, you can lose weight.","Originally, I thought English was more my home. But Spanish is so much more romantic. I've had to learn new phrases. I've had to learn to be more secure about singing in Spanish. But I'm working on it.","I loved singing rock-and-roll, jazz, anything on radio, anything commercial. I was able to do anything, but I didn't know what direction to go in.","I felt pressure to follow in Madonna's footsteps, and I didn't want to base my career on sex. So I began to change how I saw myself.","There's so much that I can give as a human being - and I know that."],"La Monte Young":["I have my own definition of minimalism, which is that which is created with a minimum of means.","One of the aspects of form that I have been very interested in is stasis - the concept of form which is not so directional in time, not so much climactic form, but rather form which allows time, to stand still.","I think the fact that I created something and had an enormous influence is indisputable.","Give people knowledge and they really eat it up and they appreciate it a lot and the more that knowledge is made available to people, the more they will utilize it and let it be a part of them.","If listeners aren't carried away to Heaven, I'm failing.","I had a calling to become what I became - I was created to do this.","Let people have an education and you can't stop them."],"La'Porsha Renae":["I'm proud of my curves, my daughter, as well as the harsh past that helped shape me into the strong woman I am today.","I do what I do to inspire people. They can't be inspired by an ego, a big-headed person. It doesn't work. It doesn't match. And I really want to be that role model for people, for children. I want to be real. To my fans, I want them to view me as a real person. Don't put me on a pedestal. I'm human. I make mistakes, I cry, I hurt - just like you.","A lot of people I guess, well, some people change when they get in spotlights and everything, but you can take the girl out of Mississippi, but you can't take Mississippi out the girl!","Now I'm going to show a side of me I haven't shown before. I'm going to be fierce.","When people ask me a personal question, I answer it in a personal way. I can only speak from the footsteps and the shoes that I've walked in.","Some people believe they chose homosexuality, and some believe they didn't. Who's to say one is wrong? It's not fair to generalize anyone's sexuality or walk of life.","My fans are so loving and encouraging. They're with me on good days and bad days.","I haven't always been confident. I actually suffered with low self-esteem growing up. Eventually, I got to a point where I was just like, 'OK, this is taking too much energy.' After that, I started accepting myself for who I was, and I was like, whoever is not going to accept it, they weren't really meant to be in my life in that way.","Everybody is a human being. We should be able to coexist with one another.","I embraced everything that I thought would hold me back from pursuing my dreams and used my insecurities to give me the courage to inspire and advocate for others who possessed many of the same insecurities I had.","We don't have to have the same truths or personal belief systems to love one another and get along.","People say a lot of hurtful things, but in a way, the abuse that I endured from my husband prepared me for that. The things I had been told and drilled into my head from him were worse than what anybody could say to me.","I learned that sometimes our struggles are a little bit bigger than us and talking about them and coming through and having the courage to get out of them. I learned how many I touched and inspired through the journey of 'Idol' because I was just singing on the show. I wasn't really being an advocate for anything.","The reaction that I got from 'Diamonds' I would have expected to get from 'House of the Rising Sun' or one of the other songs.","I would describe my sound as classic Motown.","I have a lot of written material, and all of it's different. Some records that I have are country, some pop, some alternative rock. I just write what I feel, so I can't specifically say. I just want to be an artist of truth and an artist that stays true to herself.","I knew being a musician was my calling when I was 12 or 13. I started singing when I was six but didn't actually see myself being a singer when I was 12 or 13.","I can't wait to meet Jennifer Hudson, Tamyra Gray, George Huff, Ruben Studdard, and I love me some Clay Aiken.","This is how I feel about the LGBT community: they are people just like us.","I have never spoken for anyone but myself.","A lot of people behind the scenes were telling me that I was going to have to do something with my hair, my weight, all of that stuff.","Labels, boxes, and politically correct terminology all seem small and irrelevant when being compared to the violent and brutal attacks on the lives of people who are different than what society says we should be.","A lot of the former Idols were voting for me, and that makes me feel really good.","First time I sang, I was singing Alicia Keys in the bathroom of my mom's beauty shop. I was six.","Growing up, Tina Turner was definitely one of my influences, and, um, I take things from different artists, and I put them in my music, and I put them in my persona and my - they help me form into the artist that I am, so - for people to actually hear that come through the music is exciting.","I don't want to come off as one of those artists that's not down to earth and real.","To be honest, if it wasn't for my daughter, I don't think I would have gotten out of the situation that I was in before 'Idol' because I am a domestic violence survivor.","A lot of fans have been requesting that in-your-face song, a sense of feeling empowered. And 'Good Woman' is that: a relatable song celebrating the good woman. I'm also really proud of the third verse, which I wrote.","I had a high school sweetheart that was my first. We were together all through high school. I had just broken up with him because I didn't think I was good enough. He wanted to be an anesthesiologist. I wanted to be an entertainer. His life was more planned out, and mine wasn't.","My ex-husband didn't like my singing. He didn't like my hair. He hated my eyes. Everything. Everything he complimented me on when we first met, he just hated.","I have always been a reserved and conservative person.","I grew up in Christianity. They preach a lot that you should get married and be a wife and be a virtuous woman and all of that. So I was so eager to do that, and I didn't really take the time I needed to grow into my own. And I ended up running into a really bad situation. I didn't even really date my ex-husband. We just kind of jumped into it.","I really do think that getting the golden ticket for 'American Idol,' it's just the start of something really great.","I'm an old spirit, and my voice tends to be kind of heavy and loud. I've been referenced as 'a young Aretha.'","A lot of my fans wanted a kind of 'in your face' song. They wanted a song that exemplifies me overcoming the situation I was in and just that triumphant kind of song. So, I felt like I wanted to go ahead and get that out of both of our systems with 'Good Woman'.","The kind of artist I would like to be is definitely versatile. I don't like being boxed in or put into a genre, so to speak.","What made 'American Idol' different from 'The Voice' and all these other singing competitions... 'American Idol' just gave regular old normal people like me and like Trent a chance.","Kelly Clarkson definitely reminds me of Motown. She's pop, but she's also very, very soulful.","I decided to be heterosexual because I felt like that's the life God intended me to live.","Anyone is welcome to hang out with me and have fun or sit down with me and talk. I don't discriminate against anyone. And I don't condone hating someone or treating them badly because they live differently than I do.","I come from really humble people. We never had a lot.","I stay true to myself, my daughter. I just remember where I came from - I remember what I'm coming from - and then I remember why I do what I do.","I found a belief system that worked for me, and I said, you know what, 'I actually do want to give being with men another chance.'","When people use their hurt and make a triumph in their song, that helps other people.","I love 'Battles,' and I love what it's doing for people.","There was a girl who messaged me and said she was on the verge of taking her life, then 'Battles' came on just in the nick of time.","Although all of us may not agree with that particular lifestyle for religious reasons, whatever the reason is, you still treat each other with respect.","I am one of the people who don't really agree with that lifestyle. I wasn't brought up that way; it wasn't how I was raised, but I do have a lot of friends and a lot of people that I love dearly who are gay and homosexual, and they're such sweet, nice people.","Sometimes when you do interviews, it gets twisted up.","When I saw how people would react and be touched by my voice, this was the moment I thought maybe there's something more to this than just singing around the house.","When I first start writing a song, I usually write the title first, then the song, and I'll sing the song in my head and think of a visual of the song. If I can't think of a visual behind the song, I'll throw the song away.","I would like for people to hear my music and hear/realize that people and experiences are deeper than what's at face value. Hopefully, with the span of my career, I can try to convey that in more ways than one.","I've also gotten messages from men and women who are not the most attractive, in their minds, or are self-conscious about their weight. They're thanking me for doing songs like 'Proud Mary' and shaking a tailfeather, because they say I seem real comfortable in my skin and it made them want to be comfortable in theirs.","I want to bring that old soul back, the meaningful lyrics and all of that. And I can't think of a better way to do that than through Motown.","Today, not to take away from any of the present artists, but music has gotten a little shallow, in my opinion. Everybody's talking about the same thing: sex, money, clothes, cheating... I want to open up not necessarily better conversations, but, in my opinion, more important ones, and touch on things that are actually going on.","My parents got to see all my hard work pay off.","My mom hates being on camera. My dad loves it - he eats it up!"],"LaDainian Tomlinson":["People always say, and my family has said it to me, that you know who your real friends are when you're at your lowest point and you don't have a job or whatever.","I think at the end of the day, even though I didn't win a Super Bowl ring, I felt like I backed them up for drafting me. I backed up the San Diego Chargers for picking me with the fifth pick.","As football players, our bodies know exactly what time of year it is and what we need to be doing.","When I approach guys in certain situations and talk to them about Christ, they know that I'm speaking to them in a way that's real.","I don't think Christ becomes real to us until we hit a low point in our lives and realize just how much we need Him. That's why faith affects every area of your life.","My job is to let everybody know what I stand for and to let my light shine. I want to show others the way I live so that hopefully they follow. I can also tell about my experiences as a Christian so that I may help bring others to Christ.","I make sure I always give Him all the glory and praise, because I know that in one second, one game, one play, it could be all over.","I voted for Barack Obama.","Sometimes when you're praised about something, sometimes it's deserved, and sometimes it's not deserved. Same thing with criticism. Sometimes the criticism is deserved, and sometimes it's not deserved.","You earn the respect of your peers that you play against, and they don't trash talk you.","The quicker you get acclimated to getting hit and being on the ground, it's better for you when the games start.","Faith is the biggest principle that the Bible teaches us.","It's brutal out on the football field.","People may remember something I did on the field for a couple of days, maybe a week.","I like to run fast but not drive.","Every time I touch the ball, I think I'm going to go all the way. I think I'm going to score a touchdown. I'm the runner I am because I think that I'm going to go all the way every single time I touch the ball.","I don't have to go to the weight room. I don't have to go work out if I don't want to.","I believe a lot of players that start to think about money - 'Oh my goodness; I'm up for a new contract' - they don't have a great season because they're thinking about all these different things. Do your business on the field, and everything takes care of itself.","A lot of people may know my face and know that I'm a good player on the football field, but they probably don't really know me as a person.","Over the years as I went through a lot more things, I've gotten closer and closer to God as far as praying a lot more, being into the Word.","As long as you believe in Him, no matter what happens in your life, understand that it's all for a purpose.","Nobody wants to retire from football.","I love Le'Veon Bell."],"LaMarr Woodley":["On Monday I come in and get in a full body workout, and then I come back in on Wednesday and do a quick six, which consists of bench press, biceps and triceps curls, pull downs, something for the back and the neck. And then you come back and hit it again on Friday with a 16-machine workout.","I love the smell of Burger King when I ride past, but sometimes I have to avoid it.","When I see other people out there, involved, and really giving their time and effort for the kids, then I don't mind giving my time and effort for the kids as well.","You don't want to overeat too much because then you have to work twice as hard.","In the game of football, you need to be strong, and at my position, you need to be able to put up a good fight. So I work on my upper body and lower body strength because your body's got to be able to last.","Man, y'know, I'm a music guy. I like a lot of different things. It depends on the time of the day and the situation.","I'm usually listening to Sirius Satellite in the morning. 'The Heat' usually plays good music.","Having bands in the NFL would take up seats. If you take up seats in the NFL, you're losing money.","Winning and making history is something you can't buy. Me? I'm a guy who loves history. When I'm 60 or 70, I don't want to be remembered for the money I make. I want to be in the history books."],"LaTanya Richardson":["Atlanta was a welcoming presence for a lot of artists; they called it 'the Mecca of the South.' I got to see the Negro Ensemble Company, Cicely Tyson, Geraldine Page, Ruby Dee, all onstage.","Folks are always talking about 40 acres and a mule, but what we need is some psychoanalysis. Forget 40 acres in a mule: sign all of us up for some shrinks so we can get ourselves right by reflecting and truly learning ourselves.","Look at Michelle Obama. Everyone keeps making a big deal about her arms being exposed, but don't get it twisted: her arms are out for a reason. Black women have had those arms forever - lifting, picking cotton, toting and carrying babies.","Acting is in your soul.","In the theater, it's a visceral and physical response because you move around so much. You have to do something physical to pull you in. On TV or in movies, everything is so small. You can just lock into a character and ease yourself into that way.","I don't think you can ease yourself into theater. I just thrust myself into it.","I didn't want my daughter brought up by nannies, and I didn't want her to feel I wasn't around.","Woodie King Jr., in 1970, had started a company called the New Federal Theatre, which was ensconced at the Henry Street Settlement. I did a number of plays there, and I auditioned each time. The plays were mostly new. New York was very fertile ground; there was a plethora of African-American plays being done.","I did theater at Spelman until I graduated from there, and I got to work with such luminous actresses as Diana Sands in 'Macbeth.'","I have not tried for a career that's showy. I have always tried to layer things in and not push it. I love an underperformance, where you're so entrenched in who that person is that you're living in it.","Shakespeare wrote about what was happening during the time; it still relates to us now.","I think most Americans, when we're building a character, we look at the specificity of what that person is, in particular.","I think that we're reducing who we are as human beings to these cell phones and these devices; now we don't even want to pick up a telephone to talk - we just text.","I have always been involved in some philanthropic work - growing up in the church, you always had to have a reasonable portion of service to the community and to people who have less, who need a helping hand. It's just something in my heart that I know needs to be done.","I'm always in awe at how fast television is and how quickly you're called upon to be 100 percent invested in a character with the lines.","I came to New York in 1974, when I graduated from college. And you had to use 'Backstage' because all of the auditions were listed there. Most people didn't come with agents, so you got to see a lot of what was auditioning and when and where. 'Backstage' made sure you knew the major places.","It used to just be a SAG card, and then you got an AFTRA card. I got my AFTRA card doing a commercial in Atlanta. I got my SAG card doing a beer commercial from 100 years ago; it was one of the first national commercials with a family in it that was black and normal, and I played the daughter.","There is no one American beauty or just one beautiful color in the pantheon, especially in regards to black people - there is no better color.","The theater is the reason I am an actress.","If you can make it in theater, you can make it anywhere.","From the moment I saw 'Camelot' as a kid, the organic inclination of performing before a live audience is raw and visceral. Once you're out there, there's no yelling 'Cut!' or any such thing as a do-over because that moment has passed, and you're in it as it's happened and gone, sharing it with everyone.","I know it's a stock answer, but besides acting, I'd love to produce and direct.","I've had the luxury of not having to work because of my husband.","I never played an ingenue.","Our joy was to do theater. And in some theaters, the only pay we got was tokens for carfare.","If I can stay centered, I'm basically going to be living in the world a happy person.","I've discovered that I am as strong as I thought.","I hold onto the spirit of God for everything, and that works for me. That aspect of my life is very real and is the truth.","I've learned that all of us should be constantly mindful of what's going on around us. Sometimes I think we get pretty single-minded in our pursuits and forget that we really do need each other. We need to actively engage in giving and helping each other every day."],"LaToya Jackson":["It is so difficult in the world for people to find love, true love.","I'll never stop dreaming that one day we can be a real family, together, all of us laughing and talking, loving and understanding, not looking at the past but only to the future.","People had this image of the Jacksons as the perfect American family and I destroyed that image. But what people have to understand is writing that book was very healing for me.","I can't say it's not painful being estranged from most of my family. I wish it could be otherwise.","Black people were very angry with me for writing the book. A lot of people didn't believe me, or didn't want to believe me, and that used to really bother me. It was a very painful and difficult time.","I can honestly say that I am happier now than I have ever been. For the first time in my life I feel free.","When people are in love, I don't see anything wrong with it in the world. If they choose to live their lives and get married, why should we interfere? A lot of people don't agree with me, but that's how I feel.","This is a very big victory for Michael and we are all very proud that he has been completely and totally vindicated in court, as we were certain he would be.","I am pleased to tell you that he is finally getting some rest and is regaining his appetite as well.","The end of the trial and the 'not guilty' verdicts on all counts, clearing Michael of all charges, mean that he can now concentrate on the future and his art.","He will be beginning a brand new chapter in the Michael Jackson legend.","When I finally decided to do the show, I only had two weeks to learn the choreography and the songs in French.","It was so strange. I knew that Josephine Baker had performed on the same stage but that night I felt it. Many of the same people who worked with Josephine Baker are still here. They know what they're doing. And that was a very comfortable feeling.","I posed nude to show my parents they couldn't dictate to me any more - that I control my life.","J has told me about his past. I know what happened and why. But he is the one person who made me believe in my talent and whatever happened in the past, he's been a wonderful manager to me.","Our marriage is strictly in name only. It has never been consummated.","I married him because he told me it was the only way he could protect me. If we were just manager and client, my family could do whatever they wanted to get me back, but if I was his wife, they couldn't.","When I'm ready, I plan to adopt. I still believe in family.","Michael and I talk at least every two weeks. He understands why I've done the things I have.","I think the deepest problem is between my parents and me. I just don't know if it will ever be the same.","I realize now I didn't really want to die. I just wanted to stop the hurt and pain.","I love my family and I miss them very much but I'm a new person now. I know a lot of people will not agree with what I've done, but it was right for me.","This is the first time in my life I've ever been happy, not completely happy, but happier than I've ever been.","I love songs that people can dance to and enjoy at the same time.","Listening to soft music and the sound of the ocean is quite relaxing to me.","I would love to have a rapper on one of my songs, like Ludacris, or the 'it's so hot in here' guy, Nelly."],"LaToya London":["Off camera, I am not so quiet, I have a fun time, relaxed.","Jasmine apologized and said she was sorry and said she loved me, she couldn't believe it and said she thought it would be her. All of them were really, really sorry that it happened to me.","I want to tap into different styles. Something definitely mature, sultry, sensual, easy listening that everyone can enjoy. Every one of every race and everyone that likes different styles.","2006 is all about getting your house in order and I mean that metaphorically.","First off, it's wonderful how much people are supporting me and felt I should have stayed in the competition.","I think American Idol is a great career launcher. A blessing for all of us.","I want to get into movies, not just TV series.","I would love to do a Broadway play. I would love to do big screen also, motion picture.","People love to see reactions, they love to see emotions that come about.","People want to get to know you. I don't think America got a chance to know me in that short time.","Under so much pressure and the situation that I was in, that was the personality that came across with me.","Actually, 19 is in charge of our career at that point. FOX publicity is in charge of the publicity that we get. I'm fine with it, it is really organized.","I think what was frustrating to see a lot of good people go. You don't picture it, you don't imagine it, don't think it could happen. When it does, you are puzzled.","I wanted to bring back that big, ballad type of music that we used to love so much. Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, when they first came out, that's what I grew up singing.","Last I checked, the album was #82 out of the top 200 on the Billboard charts thanks to you all. I pray that keeps moving up and with your help it will.","Randy said I could call him for anything, Paula said that she loved me and said how much of a star I was. Simon was like, keep up the good work and I'll have nothing to worry about.","Right now the focus is the album that is released and then the tour coming up. After the tour they will let us know about the options and offers that came in for us.","We will go on tour, that will be a boost for me. After that I can focus on LaToya. If I didn't have them, so many people would be coming at me right now and I wouldn't know what to do.","Comparing in the past years, Tamyra Gray and everyone else that didn't win but their careers are doing well.","I know I'm happy and can't wait to see where my career will go next. This isn't the end for any of us. I can understand why they are upset but I want them to move forward and look for the future.","I think she has more gospel style than I do. I think I'm more, umm, you know mainstream I guess. I don't know if we split the vote. That could be possible but I don't think we are the same at all.","It's funny, we all really, really got along. I don't know how it was in years past but this year, I was really with a good group of people. No one tried to sabotage each other or steal the other ones moments.","Let me just worry about me. I'm not worried about anyone else. If you're doing fine, great; if you're struggling, I hope things get better for you. But I've got to be worried about my career.","Well, being that, at the house and being in the competition, it was very hard to be with family. We couldn't have visitors out of respect for everyone else there. But, being the American Idol, the focus would have been on me."],"Labrinth":["Different cultures produce a different 'cool.' And your perception of 'cool' changes depending on where you are.","Everyone in my family has been in music - my cousins, my grandmother, my grandfather - so it's quite a big family tree.","I'm a hundred percent a rock n' roll guy.","I want to be a little bit brave. I want to feel scared sometimes. That's what's going to change the music business, if we have that kind of attitude.","I've made so many changes to my records because of the way the audience has reacted at the various festivals I've played - I've taken tracks back into the studio, stripped them bare, and built them back up again to create something entirely different.","I don't think about the success that I've had - I've had a lot of success with music - but I always look at it like it's a new day.","When I listen to a Coldplay record, you're gonna hear an indie band, and you know that's what you're gonna get from Coldplay. With myself, I'm not sure it's the same.","I definitely didn't wanna be a one-dimensional artist that you can just put into one box. Because, to me, we're all masters of certain energies, and we all create different colours.","I really enjoy 'festival life,' as it were, and I love the reactions when I bring out my guitar on stage. The crowd are always a bit like, 'What the hell is this urban guy doing with a guitar,' and that's what I love - the shock element of it all!","I don't want to be someone that, when people look back, they think, 'Yeah, cool, he made us jump around for a bit in 2010.'","I'm not just looking to be famous and attach myself to famous names. I want to make history in the business in terms of creativity.","My fans are like, 'Lab does what he does,' which is really cool. If I came out with a Jack White rock tune tomorrow, people would be like, 'Yeah, cool man,' which is great.","As a breed, I think artists are never 100% satisfied with their work, and we will always want that little bit of extra time to put the final gloss on it.","I'm a musical geek. It's like there's this big, wild universe in my head, and I love to express it.","I remember my brother came home with a bass and played a blues solo on it. I just went insane for days afterwards learning that.","You've got to live and die by your decisions.","My main thing is I just want to share as much hope and happiness as possible for music. If I can share as many moments and help people believe in themselves... if I can do that, then I'll feel like my job is done.","I got into music through just being inspired by my brother and sisters. They all sing, play instruments and write - and they're very good at it.","Of course, success takes you where your character can't sustain you.","I have to be honest: I think production is mad - exciting - because, of course, you're creating the record. When you're a singer, you're just singing. Creating the music, directing, and seeing where it's gonna go in production is very, very exciting.","One thing I always really enjoyed about Quincy Jones' production technique was that there were so many layers to every song. Like, one week you'd hear a new trumpet-line, then the next week you'd hear - be hearing a new guitar-line.","I don't see categories; I don't see styles - l see them all gelled together. And it was gospel that definitely helped me to do that.","I need to make money, but I don't want to be another guy selling his McDonald's to the pop market.","I grew up not really having a father figure, and it didn't bother me, because he wasn't there in the first place. But then he started other families, and I was jealous. It was like he was happy without our family.","Urban is not actually my world. It was me trying something out, basically. I come from a gospel background.","When you make a record, I always imagine people dancing to it. If the chef thinks it tastes good, then there will be someone who ultimately believes the same thing.","It's a lot easier producing for people or being in the background, and they can take all the fire from the front. But in order to express the ideas that I have without any kind of contamination, I thought it would be a cool thing to be out front.","I've got perfectionist issues, as I can't seem to let tracks out the studio - it drives my manager nuts.","I don't ever think it's a good idea to try to recreate the success you've had before; it's all about chasing something fresh and new.","My ethos is musical freedom: to create whatever I want.","I'm all for trying anything once; otherwise, you end up like David Guetta - reproducing the same formula over and over.","I think producing a record for other artists is almost like giving them advice, and I would say that it is easier to produce another artist than it is to produce yourself.","Those that know me know that I'm not 100% in love with commercial pop music. It's not my preferred genre - I don't do squeaky clean pop.","I think, as an artist, I wear a lot of different hats, and people have to join all of the dots.","I'm a perfectionist, and to actually finish something is good for me.","The first tour an artist does is a strange one... because you can never tell how the audience is going to react.","I try as much I can after every live performance to read all the comments my fans post on Facebook and Twitter, as this helps enormously for me to understand straight from fans what worked and what didn't.","I have learned that while your putting your record together you can get so caught up in making what you want that you forget what you wanted in the first place.","When I was younger, I'd be in the studio three days straight to get something right, and my manager would be like, 'Go home!' Even now, I still sleep in the studio sometimes, but I can't do it quite as often. I've got gigs; I can't have my hobo beard! But if you love what you're doing, you can't stop. It's obsessive.","My mother brought up nine children, in Hackney, and none of us are criminals, none of us in jail. Her strength made me who I am today.","English urban artists were very used to making secondhand American music, and I thought that was boring.","Branding your song is the worst thing you can ever do. That's turning your song into a product.","I'm from Hackney, and it's an area that is not so pretty, and we have a different way of expressing ourselves than somebody from uptown that has lots of money.","I actually tried to learn the dictionary at one point. It didn't work; I only got through the first few pages.","I know this sounds weird, but I honestly believe music comes from the universe. Inspiration comes from the universe, and you drag it into your mind.","I never called myself an urban artist, but that's what I was classed as, and I almost tried to live up to the name instead of who I really was.","You get so close to your own music that you can't see the beauty in it. I had to learn to let go. It's good to be less precious.","My brothers came home with country, jazz, everything... it was always very normal to me to make any type of music. It was possible to fuse all the sounds, so it never sounded confusing to me to mix jazz and dubstep.","My grandad's a gospel singer, and his children were singers, too. But I don't believe in God in the same way... not religion; it breaks us up too much. The same with musical styles - it breaks people up. I believe they are all one thing - why not put them together?","You can't go up to girls and start talking about minor 7ths and expect to pull. It's not going to work.","You can make what you want. People care about what the artist has to say, what the sound is, and how it affects them.","I have eight siblings, and we formed a group called Mac 9. I was Mac 7."],"Lacey Chabert":["It's more fun if you can control things like lighting and make special effects in the darkroom.","Do what you're passionate about.","I don't want to be a 'teen star' because so many people don't ever grow out of that.","I like to take pictures of lots of things: people-such as my nephews, my dogs, and just interesting objects that I see. For instance, I might take a picture of flowers by the side of the road, an old sign or a fence.","I like shopping, and I like to drive.","I need to decide whether to apply for college or delay it for a couple of years while I pursue some more acting projects. Right now I'm trying to sort things out, so I can make the right choices.","We did a remake of Lost in Space. Filmed it in London for four months.","I had to have my first kiss in front of, like, a hundred people. I didn't know what to do. So my sisters told me to, like, practice on a pillow, you know? But it didn't kiss me back so I didn't know what to expect.","The only way I can be there and really get into the character is if I'm her.","I loved school. But when I started 'Party of Five' in the fifth grade, I was taken out of school and tutored on the set.","I always wanted to entertain. When I was little, I would sing in front of the mirror with a hairbrush or my sisters and I would make shows. I always wanted to be on TV.","When I was growing up I always wanted to be a waitress. My sister opened a restaurant in Mississippi, and I went down there and was a waitress for a few days. Let me tell you, I got it out of my system.","My family has always called me 'Lay Lay,' and my dad used to always call me 'Dynamite Termite' because I was really short and small and I hated to be still. I would never stop."],"Lacey Schwimmer":["I think on a bucket list for a performer is definitely doing a stage show, whether it's in Vegas or on Broadway or whatever.","I've always danced. I've always been around it.","Dancers have always been a kind of background image, we've always danced behind an artist or we've danced in a movie behind the actors. We've always been very secondary.","If I'm dancing, or teaching, or having a family I would want to live life to the fullest as possible.","I've had every hair style imaginable.","I think being sublimely happy is the only thing I could ever hope for in life.","Swing dance has been a part of my life since I was born.","I like having curves - I'm proud of them!"],"Lactantius":["It is possible that Mount Olympus may have supplied the poets with the hint for saying that Jupiter obtained the kingdom of heaven, because Olympus is the common name both of the mountain and of heaven.","Cicero, in his treatise concerning the Nature of the Gods, having said that three Jupiters were enumerated by theologians, adds that the third was of Crete, the son of Saturn, and that his tomb is shown in that island.","Nobody is poor unless he stand in need of justice.","The first point of wisdom is to discern that which is false; the second, to know that which is true.","But God, who is immortal, has no need of difference of sex, nor of succession.","But God, who is the Eternal Mind, is undoubtedly of excellence, complete and perfect in every part.","But some one will say that this supreme Being, who made all things, and those also who conferred on men particular benefits, are entitled to their respective worship.","For if God is a title of the highest power, He must be incorruptible, perfect, incapable of suffering, and subject to no other being; therefore they are not gods whom necessity compels to obey the one greatest God.","For if the honour paid to Him is shared by others, He altogether ceases to be worshipped, since His religion requires us to believe that He is the one and only God.","For they, the philosophers, were considered teachers of right living, which is far more excellent, since to speak well belongs only to a few, but to live well belongs to all.","Homer was able to give us no information relating to the truth, for he wrote of human rather than divine things.","Let us come to the philosophers, whose authority is of greater weight, and their judgment more to be relied on, because they are believed to have paid attention, not to matters of fiction, but to the investigation of the truth.","Mars, when guilty of homicide, and set free from the charge of murder by the Athenians through favour, lest he should appear to be too fierce and savage, committed adultery with Venus.","The poets, therefore, however much they adorned the gods in their poems, and amplified their exploits with the highest praises, yet very frequently confess that all things are held together and governed by one spirit or mind.","The prophets, who were very many, proclaim and declare the one God; for, being filled with the inspiration of the one God, they predicted things to come, with agreeing and harmonious voice.","There is no one, who possesses intelligence and uses reflection, who does not understand that it is one Being who both created all things and governs them with the same energy by which He created them.","Therefore God is one, if that which admits of so great power can be nothing else: and yet those who deem that there are many gods, say that they have divided their functions among themselves; but we will discuss all these matters at their proper places.","Therefore let men withdraw themselves from errors; and laying aside corrupt superstitions, let them acknowledge their Father and Lord, whose excellence cannot be estimated, nor His greatness perceived, nor His beginning comprehended.","Therefore, if the gods are immortal and eternal, what need is there of the other sex, when they themselves do not require succession, since they are always about to exist?","When their city was occupied by the Gauls, and the Romans, who were besieged in the Capitol, had made military engines from the hair of the women, they dedicated a temple to the Bald Venus.","Where fear is present, wisdom cannot be.","Memory tempers prosperity, mitigates adversity, controls youth, and delights old age."],"Lady Bird Johnson":["Art is the window to man's soul. Without it, he would never be able to see beyond his immediate world; nor could the world see the man within.","Any committee is only as good as the most knowledgeable, determined and vigorous person on it. There must be somebody who provides the flame.","Perhaps no place in any community is so totally democratic as the town library. The only entrance requirement is interest.","The first lady is, and always has been, an unpaid public servant elected by one person, her husband.","The clash of ideas is the sound of freedom.","Every politician should have been born an orphan and remain a bachelor.","Become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid.","Children are apt to live up to what you believe of them.","The First Lady is an unpaid public servant elected by one person - her husband.","No news at 4:30 a.m. is good.","A politician ought to be born a foundling and remain a bachelor.","It's odd that you can get so anesthetized by your own pain or your own problem that you don't quite fully share the hell of someone close to you."],"Lady Gaga":["Whether I'm wearing lots of makeup or no makeup, I'm always the same person inside.","I've been searching for ways to heal myself, and I've found that kindness is the best way.","The only big things I've purchased are my dad's heart valve and a Rolls-Royce for my parents, for their anniversary. And that was only because my dad had a Lady Gaga license plate on our old car and it was making me crazy because he was getting followed everywhere, so I bought him a new car.","I actually don't want a throne at all, because I don't view myself as a queen; I view myself as one of my fans.","Music is one of the most powerful things the world has to offer. No matter what race or religion or nationality or sexual orientation or gender that you are, it has the power to unite us.","I allow myself to fail. I allow myself to break. I'm not afraid of my flaws.","I've been actually really very pleased to see how much awareness was raised around bullying, and how deeply it affects everyone. You know, you don't have to be the loser kid in high school to be bullied. Bullying and being picked on comes in so many different forms.","'Born this Way' is about being yourself, and loving who you are and being proud.","I am an artist, and I have the ability and the free will to choose the way the world will envision me.","I think tolerance and acceptance and love is something that feeds every community.","I'm half living my life between reality and fantasy at all times.","I am my own sanctuary and I can be reborn as many times as I choose throughout my life.","History shows us that in times of people feeling like they are in need of some sort of rebellion or protests, the artists rise because the poetry we create about pain and its relationship to culture in the world begins to soothe and heal people who are feeling confused or afraid.","I work all day, do research, sketch my ideas, prepare for performances.","I feel like if you're a really good human being, you can try to find something beautiful in every single person, no matter what.","There is something in the way that we are now, with our cell phones, and people are not looking at each other and not being in the moment with each other, that kids feel isolated.","Because the sweeter the cake, the more bitter the jelly can be.","I wouldn't say that I am one of the greatest dancers, but I am really quite good at what I do.","At the end of the day, who I really and truly am is a little girl who loved to play the piano.","I don't think I could live without hair, makeup and styling, let alone be the performer I am. I am a glamour girl through and through. I believe in the glamorous life and I live one.","I think that promoting insecurity in the form of plastic surgery is infinitely more harmful than an artistic expression related to body modification.","Returning to your family and where you came from, and your history... this is what makes you strong. It's not looking out that's going to do that - it's looking in.","The darkness, the loop of negative thoughts on repeat, clamours and interferes with the music I hear in my head.","I love Dolce & Gabbana. I love Versace. I love the crazy, more eccentric stuff.","In fact, my courage and my bravery at a young age was the thing I was bullied for, a kind of 'Who do you think you are?'","I'm confident in who I am. I've come to a place in my life where I've accepted things that are me, as opposed to feeling pressure to explain myself to people around me. That's just the way I've always tried to be. It didn't change when I became a star.","Being beautiful is not so fun when you're in a business with all men.","I work very hard, but when God opens that door for you - when life opens that door for you, I should say - I think it's important to be giving, to return the love back.","I'm not one icon. I'm every icon. I'm an icon that is made out of all the colors on the palette at every time. I have no restrictions. No restrictions.","I believe in a passion for inclusion.","You shouldn't have to have money to have a luxury fragrance.","If you were to ask me what I want to do - I don't want to be a celebrity, I want to make a difference.","I'm definitely a Polaroid camera girl. For me, what I'm really excited about is bringing back the artistry and the nature of Polaroid.","I began singing in dive bars and really small clubs. I dragged my piano down the stairs, and I went down the street with my keyboard, and I would go to every different dive bar that I could get to agree to let me play. I'd call and pretend I was Lady Gaga's manager.","I think it's OK to be confident in yourself.","I try to not focus on what people expect from me.","It sometimes makes people feel better about themselves, you know, to put other people down, or make fun of them, or maybe make mockery of their work and that doesn't make me feel good at all.","I don't see myself in terms of artifice. I see myself as a real person who chooses to live my life in an open way - artistically.","When I say to you, there is nobody like me, and there never was, that is a statement I want every woman to feel and make about themselves.","I'm a wandering gypsy.","In a sense I portray myself in a very androgynous way, and I love androgyny.","The Internet is a toilet. It is.","I just am committed wholeheartedly to theatre with no intermission.","I love my friends and my past, and it's made me who I am.","I don't see myself as ever being like anybody else.","I don't keep people around me that aren't family. You don't get to stay. Unless you're eating at the table with us, you're not part. We eat together, we cry together, we live together, we die together. Everything that we do is for each other, and we care for another.","It was my delusion and naivety that brought me here.","That is what fame is, isn't it? To get the world to fall in love with you.","So there's nothing more provocative than taking a genre that everybody who's cool hates - and then making it cool.","My apartment is my stage, and my bedroom is my stage - they're just not stages you're allowed to see.","When there's justice and change, you start to see the cleansing of the soul, and that is what I want for people, and I hope it's okay for me to say those things.","I'm doing everything that I can, working with experts, really studying the statistics to figure out a way we can make it cool or normal to be kind and loving.","I'm not a sandwich store that only sells turkey sandwiches. I sell a lot of different things.","Well, in order for me to be successful... In order to be a great artist - musician, actor, painter, whatever - you must be able to be private in public at all times.","I was a strange, loud little kid who could sit at the piano and kill a Beethoven piece.","If you don't feel safe as a child, you can't learn.","I'm really happy and had such an amazing time performing at Super Bowl - wish I could relive it all over again.","I am not some goddess that dropped down from the sky to sing pop music; I am not some extra-incredible human person that needs to be told how wonderful they are all day and kissed.","I miss people. I miss going anywhere and meeting a random person and saying 'Hi' and having a conversation about life. I love people.","Every bit of me is devoted to love and art. And I aspire to try to be a teacher to my young fans who feel just like I felt when I was younger. I just felt like a freak. I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm trying to liberate them, I want to free them of their fears and make them feel that they can make their own space in the world.","I'm perpetually lonely.","If you only believe that you're an artist when you have a big advance in your pocket and a single coming out, I would say that's quite soulless. You have to have a sense of your own greatness and your own ability from a very deep place inside you. I am the one with the litmus test in my hands of what people need to hear next.","I don't want to make money; I want to make a difference.","I do yoga, I do Bikram and I run, and I eat really healthy.","My concerts are about me being very private in public, but I'm very protective.","I've had faith my whole life that there was someone looking out for me, a spirit guide, a soul guide.","I don't think I could think of a single thing that's more isolating than being famous.","I wanted to only create a great perfume, not any perfume that would sell, but a great artistic one that the fans would not feel cheated by.","I think what it really is, is that I date creative people. And I think that what intimidates them is not my purse; it's my mind.","Pop music will never be low brow.","I believe that if you have revolutionary potential, you must make the world a better place and use it.","Everybody always laughs because I feel so much more comfortable with, like, a giant paper bag on my whole body and paint on my face. Sometimes I try really hard to take it all off. But inevitably what's underneath is still not a straight edge. And I don't think it ever will be.","Celebrity life and media culture are probably the most overbearing pop-cultural conditions that we as young people have to deal with, because it forces us to judge ourselves.","I wanted to be a skinny little ballerina but I was a voluptuous little Italian girl whose dad had meatballs on the table every night.","In case you're wondering whether I lip synch, the answer is no... people think so because I sound so good.","The kindness that's been shown to me, by doctors as well as my family and my friends, it's really saved my life.","Vanity can create a very cruel space for you if you don't know how to manage it.","I don't like Los Angeles. The people are awful and terribly shallow, and everybody wants to be famous but nobody wants to play the game. I'm from New York. I will kill to get what I need."],"Lady Gregory":["It was among farmers and potato diggers and old men in workhouses and beggars at my own door that I found what was beyond these and yet farther beyond that drawingroom poet of my childhood in the expression of love, and grief, and the pain of parting, that are the disclosure of the individual soul.","I feel more and more the time wasted that is not spent in Ireland.","Every day in the year there comes some malice into the world, and where it comes from is no good place.","We would not give up our own country - Ireland - if we were to get the whole world as an estate, and the Country of the Young along with it.","It takes madness to find out madness.","It is not known, now, for what length of time the Tuatha de Danaan had the sway over Ireland, and it is likely it was a long time they had it, but they were put from it at last.","From the sons of Ith, the first of the Gael to get his death in Ireland, there came in the after time Fathadh Canaan, that got the sway over the whole world from the rising to the setting sun, and that took hostages of the streams and the birds and the languages.","Everything that is bad, the falling sickness - God save the mark - or the like, should be at its worst at the full moon. I suppose because it is the leader of the stars.","Every trick is an old one, but with a change of players, a change of dress, it comes out as new as before.","I don't know in the world why anyone would consent to be a king, and never to be left to himself, but to be worried and wearied and interfered with from dark to daybreak and from morning to the fall of night.","It was in a mist the Tuatha de Danaan, the people of the gods of Dana, or as some called them, the Men of Dea, came through the air and the high air to Ireland.","It is not always them that has the most that makes the most show.","As to the old history of Ireland, the first man ever died in Ireland was Partholan, and he is buried, and his greyhound along with him, at some place in Kerry.","Queen Victoria was loyal and true to the Pope; that is what I was told, and so is Edward the Seventh loyal and true, but he has got something contrary in his body.","Once in my childhood I had been eager to learn Irish; I thought to get leave to take lessons from an old Scripture-reader who spent a part of his time in the parish of Killinane, teaching such scholars as he could find to read their own language in the hope that they might turn to the only book then being printed in Irish, the Bible.","I'll take no charity! What I get I'll earn by taking it. I would feel no pleasure it being given to me, any more than a huntsman would take pleasure being made a present of a dead fox, in place of getting a run across country after it.","Well, there's no one at all, they do be saying, but is deserving of some punishment from the very minute of his birth.","It is the old battle, between those who use a toothbrush and those who don't.","What the Danes left in Ireland were hens and weasels. And when the cock crows in the morning, the country people will always say 'It is for Denmark they are crowing. Crowing they are to be back in Denmark.'","It's best make changes little by little, the same as you'd put clothes upon a growing child.","It was on the first day of Beltaine, that is called now May Day, the Tuatha de Danaan came, and it was to the north-west of Connacht they landed. But the Firbolgs, the Men of the Bag, that were in Ireland before them, and that had come from the South, saw nothing but a mist, and it lying on the hills.","It was at Inver Slane, to the north of Leinster, the sons of Gaedhal of the Shining Armour, the Very Gentle, that were called afterwards the Sons of the Gael, made their first attempt to land in Ireland to avenge Ith, one of their race that had come there one time and had met with his death.","It is what the poets of Ireland used to be saying, that every brave man, good at fighting, and every man that could do great deeds and not be making much talk about them, was of the Sons of the Gael; and that every skilled man that had music and that did enchantments secretly, was of the Tuatha de Danaan.","To you, W. B. Yeats, good praiser, wholesome dispraiser, heavy-handed judge, open-handed helper of us all, I offer a play of my plays for every night of the week, because you like them, and because you have taught me my trade.","Our curses on them that boil the eggs too hard! What use is an egg that is hard to any person on earth?","Many a poor soul has had to suffer from the weight of the debts on him, finding no rest or peace after death.","There is lasting kindness in Heaven when no kindness is found upon earth.","When I was a child and came with my elders to Galway for their salmon fishing in the river that rushes past the gaol, I used to look with awe at the window where men were hung, and the dark, closed gate.","The first play I wrote was called 'Twenty-five.' It was played by our company in Dublin and London, and was adapted and translated into Irish and played in America.","There is many a man without learning will get the better of a college-bred man, and will have better words, too.","The Georges were fair; they left all to the Government; but Anne was very bad and a tyrant. She tyrannised over the Irish. She died broken-hearted with all the bad things that were going on about her. For Queen Anne was very wicked; oh, very wicked, indeed!","Thomas Davis was a great man where poetry is concerned, and a better than Thomas Moore. All over Ireland his poetry is, and he would have done other things but that he died young.","My husband was in the war of the Crimea. It is terrible the hardships he went through, to be two months without going into a house, under the snow in trenches. And no food to get, maybe a biscuit in the day. And there was enough food there, he said, to feed all Ireland; but bad management, they could not get it.","Napoleon the Third was not much. He died in England, and was buried in a country church-yard much the same as Kiltartan. But Napoleon the First was a great man; it was given out of him there never would be so great a man again.","In writing a little tragedy, 'The Gaol Gate,' I made the scenario in three lines, 'He is an informer; he is dead; he is hanged.' I wrote that play very quickly.","In the whole course of our work at the theatre we have been, I may say, drenched with advice by friendly people who for years gave us the reasons why we did not succeed... All their advice, or at least some of it, might have been good if we had wanted to make money, to make a common place of amusement.","In my childhood there was every year at my old home, Roxborough, or, as it is called in Irish, Cregroostha, a great sheep-shearing that lasted many days. On the last evening there was always a dance for the shearers and their helpers, and two pipers used to sit on chairs placed on a corn-bin to make music for the dance.","Ah, I am thinking people put more in their prayers than was ever put in them by God.","The way most people fail is in not keeping up the heart.","The time the moon is going back, the blood that is in a person does be weakening, but when the moon is strong, the blood that moves strong in the same way. And it to be at the full, it drags the wits along with it, the same as it drags the tide.","There is no sin coveting things are of no great use or profit, but would show out good and have some grandeur around them.","It was in a stonecutter's house where I went to have a headstone made for Raftery's grave that I found a manuscript book of his poems, written out in the clear beautiful Irish characters.","I was told in many places of Osgar's bravery and Goll's strength and Conan's bitter tongue, and the arguments of Oisin and Patrick. And I have often been given the story of Oisin's journey to Tir-nan-Og, the Country of the Young, that is, as I am told, a fine place and everything that is good is in it.","What are prophecies? Don't we hear them every day of the week? And if one comes true there may be seven blind and come to nothing.","There's too many sounds in the world! The sounds of the earth are terrible! The roots squeezing and jostling one another through the clefts, and the crashing of the acorn from the oak. The cry of the little birdeen in under the silence of the hawk!","Irish history having been forbidden in schools, has been, to a great extent, learned from Raftery's poems by the people of Mayo, where he was born, and of Galway, where he spent his later years.","When death comes, it is not enough to have been charitable; and it is not right to touch the body or lay it out for a couple of hours; for the soul should be given time to fight for itself, and to go up to judgment.","I hold that the beginning of modern Irish drama was in the winter of 1898, at a school feast at Coole, when Douglas Hyde and Miss Norma Borthwick acted in Irish in a Punch and Judy show; and the delighted children went back to tell their parents what grand curses 'An Craoibhin' had put on the baby and the policeman.","The Gaelic language itself depends very much on ear and rhythm, and when those who are thinking in Gaelic speak in English, they get the same rhythm.","I don't think Ireland has ever had a genius for the novel. Of course, there were plenty of Irish novels, but I don't think that was ever the natural means of expression for the Irish.","What makes Ireland inclined toward the drama is that it's a great country for conversation.","I really do not see why there is not a splendid field for good work on the music hall stage, and if I did not have my own theatre taking up my time, I should rather like to go into it."],"Lady Randolph Churchill":["Treat your friends as you do your best pictures, and place them in their best light.","Life is not always not always what one wants it to be., but to make the best of it as it is the only way of being happy.","Treat your friends as you do your pictures, and place them in their best light.","You may be a princess or the richest woman in the world, but you cannot be more than a lady.","We owe something to extravagance, for thrift and adventure seldom go hand in hand.","One is forever throwing away substance for shadows.","It is so tempting to try the most difficult thing possible.","He has a future and I have a past, so we should be all right."],"Lady Starlight":["Any kind of restrictions put on free speech would have worse consequences than bullying.","I spent two years living in London - I'd have stayed for ever if I could have got a work visa. It was there I started collecting vinyl and fell in love with the sounds of the 1970s.","If everything is the same, nothing is special.","I don't believe in societal restrictions. It wasn't a choice - conformity simply never occurred to me.","As a unique person, I was bullied badly as a teen.","I've always been compelled by some force to be a performer.","Not to speak disparagingly of Justin Bieber or Rihanna, but they're not so hands-on with their image or their sound. They don't write the music. They have people doing things for them.","I think that fame only goes to your head if you are not a real artist. If you are a real artist and a good person who loves what they are doing, you are going to be the same person."],"Lael Brainard":["When women were excluded from New Deal programs, Eleanor Roosevelt fought to include them. Roosevelt was among a handful of leaders who realized the U.S. economy would not escape the depths of recession without the full contributions of women.","Women with minimal access to resources and no access to child care have limited choices that too often mean low-wage and part-time labor. In rural communities in the developing world, when women farmers have unequal access to fertilizers or training, their farm productivity lags behind men.","President Obama has called for economic and political empowerment of women globally. The Equal Futures Partnership promotes removal of policy, legal, and regulatory barriers that hold women back at local, state and national levels.","President Obama has a good sense not just of the economic requisites for financial crisis firefighting but also how you build political support for moving forward on reforming the financial system, making sure that the banks are carrying enough capital.","The use of pirated software in China is really quite a sizeable loss to our software producers.","Here at home, President Obama early on made the connection between growth and economic opportunity for women. In the depths of our crisis in 2009, one of the first laws the president signed was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. He established an Equal Pay Task Force led by Valerie Jarrett to help women get paid what they earn.","The key to a resilient global recovery, where growth in each country advances growth in every country, is action directed at supporting demand at home."],"Laeta Kalogridis":["The emotional passage of time is always a good thing.","Our worst instincts as human beings have to do with our carelessness with natural resources, and when the body itself becomes just one more of those resources, how will we treat it? Will we treat it with such indifference and with such depersonalization that it becomes more like a very fancy car than a repository of the self?","Of course I worry about whitewashing, and I feel very strongly that whitewashing was, is, and continues to be a problem in entertainment.","This kind of art - the dystopic future kind of art - is designed to make you uncomfortable.","When I was a kid, my grandparents were Greek immigrants on my father's side. My grandfather used to read me Greek myths, in which there are a great many goddesses and stories of strong women. And I was entranced by them. Then I started reading science fiction very young, and I loved it.","There was a brief period in college where I flirted with the idea of becoming a lawyer because my father was one. But I was cured of it rather swiftly.","Don't worry about what happens when things go wrong; just accept that they're going to, and figure out how do you want to cope with it when it does.","One of my favorite stories is, I got fired off 'Bionic Woman' in part because I was told that I don't know how to write women, and they promptly replaced me with a guy. What I find lovely about the story is how unaware the white dude who said that to me was when he said it.","The range of my interests in science fiction - it really does run a gamut.","The essential nature of all filmed entertainment is that you area always straddling the line of whether or not you can realize something that you want to do.","I just never count on anything. You can't.","My favorite Asimov works were the 'Foundation' books because the concept, at the time, was crazy, but psycho-history has now turned out to be an actual real thing. You can predict the actions of large groups of people once you understand, for lack of a better way to put it, their way of existing and their prejudices.","All of us in the modern world are constructing our identities, largely through social media, for a larger audience.","All the science fiction I loved as a kid was holding up a mirror to society and warning us about the need for course correction.","'The Handmaid's Tale' is not a book or show advocating enslaving women or creating a theocracy. It's not glorifying that. It's talking about what happens if that happens.","Margaret Atwood and Ursula K. Le Guin were the biggest inspirations for my work because they trod into areas considered to be owned by male writers and created these worlds that are infused with an understanding of so much more than just technology.","The intersection of being female and a showrunner carries difficult challenges.","There are certain expectations placed on writers if other people have put a value on their gender. I'm aware of the hundreds of tiny differences that happen when people are seeing your gender before they see something else.","I don't have to spend a lot of time figuring out, 'Gosh, I wonder how guys feel,' because most every piece of art I look at invites me into that experience.","I'm a geek! I'm a fan girl; I'm very proud of that. Get me near Orlando Jones, it will not be pretty.","I personally believe that violence against women in our society is not going anywhere.","I've taken a number of creative leaps, and some of them worked, and some of them didn't, but I don't regret any of them because you can't possibly get to the ones that work without the ones that don't.","For years, I have been inspired by the inventive and masterful storytelling of the 'SAO' franchise. I'm thrilled to get the opportunity to work with such talented partners to bring this cutting-edge yet timeless story to a new format at Skydance.","The world that we live in isn't uniform-looking, and the future that we're headed toward isn't uniform-looking.","It was very, very important to me to represent a broader swath of humanity that often isn't seen in futuristic sci-fi.","It's always fair to criticize, to question, to engage about things like whitewashing and violence against women and choices of lack of diversity. All those things are really, really a good thing to talk about.","When you haven't met someone, regardless of whether they're an author or not, when you're taking their work, and you are in some way filtering it or interpreting it, of course there's potential for them to feel that you have, in some way, not lived up to what it could have been.","To be a working writer is the holy grail, where you don't have three other jobs on top of that.","Like a lot of people, I sold my first script in graduate school at UCLA, a 'Joan of Arc' for producer Joel Silver.","Violence in drama is an external contextualization of internal conflicts.","On one hand, my gender has never been an issue. The issue has always been what's on the page. But the reality is, an awful lot of women fought an awful lot of battles to get me to that place.","'Altered Carbon' is one of the most seminal pieces of post-cyberpunk hard science fiction out there - a dark, complex noir story that challenges our ideas of what it means to be human when all information becomes encodable, including the human mind.","Honestly, I would never say, 'Oh, I've decided not to read 'The Left Hand of Darkness' because I've seen 'Blade Runner.' I've decided not to read 'Neuromancer' because I've seen 'Blade Runner.''","Iconic jobs are interesting to deconstruct through therapy.","Being a superhero is a metaphor for a job that is overwhelming."],"Laetitia Casta":["Real beauty is to be true to oneself. That's what makes me feel good.","I don't understand why women journalists always ask women about motherhood? It's far more important and interesting for women to talk about their work, their thoughts, their creativity and their individual identity.","It is when I am working that the real me comes out - that is when I am the most real and honest.","And there is a beautiful thing which is wonderful, to look like a woman, not a green bean.","What is interesting about me isn't that I am a mother, it is who I am. I love my family, but if I just talk to you about being a mother, it's boring. I am sorry, but it's reducing who I really am, and it's really boring.","I didn't like the idea of changing myself for the industry. I felt to have my teeth straightened and bleached and to starve myself to change my body was not respecting who I was.","It's always fun to immerse yourself in a different time period.","Working with kids can be tricky because they can be pretty unpredictable.","I was very excited to work with Nick Jarecki and, of course, to be in a film with Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon!","I want to work on interesting parts that I can believe in.","'The Master' is a wonderful film, honestly, and the actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, are incredible.","Yves Saint Laurent was the first person who made me feel like a woman."],"Lafcadio Hearn":["To ancient Chinese fancy, the Milky Way was a luminous river, - the River of Heaven, - the Silver Stream.","It is no exaggeration to say that the English Bible is, next to Shakespeare, the greatest work in English literature, and that it will have much more influence than even Shakespeare upon the written and spoken language of the English race.","A great many things which in times of lesser knowledge we imagined to be superstitious or useless, prove today on examination to have been of immense value to mankind.","The great principle of Western society is that competition rules here as it rules in everything else. The best man - that is to say, the strongest and cleverest - is likely to get the best woman, in the sense of the most beautiful person.","The time of illusion, then, is the beautiful moment of passion; it represents the artistic zone in which the poet or romance writer ought to be free to do the very best that he can.","The highest duty of the man is not to his father, but to his wife; and for the sake of that woman he abandons all other earthly ties, should any of these happen to interfere with that relation.","One of the great defects of English books printed in the last century is the want of an index.","I often imagine that the longer he studies English literature the more the Japanese student must be astonished at the extraordinary predominance given to the passion of love both in fiction and in poetry.","For this reason, to study English literature without some general knowledge of the relation of the Bible to that literature would be to leave one's literary education very incomplete.","Broad tolerance in the matter of beliefs is necessarily a part of the new ethics.","But what is after all the happiness of mere power? There is a greater happiness possible than to be lord of heaven and earth; that is the happiness of being truly loved.","There was very little suicide among the men of the North, because every man considered it his duty to get killed, not to kill himself; and to kill himself would have seemed cowardly, as implying fear of being killed by others.","There is one type of ideal woman very seldom described in poetry - the old maid, the woman whom sorrow or misfortune prevents from fulfilling her natural destiny.","There are two methods for the literary study of any book - the first being the study of its thought and emotion; the second only that of its workmanship. A student of literature should study some of the Bible from both points of view.","The Western poet and writer of romance has exactly the same kind of difficulty in comprehending Eastern subjects as you have in comprehending Western subjects.","The subject of Finnish poetry ought to have a special interest for the Japanese student, if only for the reason that Finnish poetry comes more closely in many respects to Japanese poetry than any other form of Western poetry.","The proverbial philosophy of a people helps us to understand more about them than any other kind of literature.","Some persons have ventured to say that it is only since Englishmen ceased to believe in the Bible that they began to discover how beautiful it was.","Perhaps there is an idea among Japanese students that one general difference between Japanese and Western poetry is that the former cultivates short forms and the latter longer ones, gut this is only in part true.","Of course, the simple explanation of the fact is that marriage is the most important act of man's life in Europe or America, and that everything depends upon it.","It is true that short forms of poetry have been cultivated in the Far East more than in modern Europe; but in all European literature short forms of poetry are to be found - indeed quite as short as anything in Japanese.","It has been wisely observed by the greatest of modern thinkers that mankind has progressed more rapidly in every other respect than in morality.","Is woman a religion? Well, perhaps you will have the chance of judging for yourselves if you go to America. There you will find men treating women with just the same respect formerly accorded only to religious dignitaries or to great nobles.","In the world of reality the more beautiful a work of art, the longer, we may be sure, was the time required to make it, and the greater the number of different minds which assisted in its development.","French novels generally treat of the relations of women to the world and to lovers, after marriage; consequently there is a great deal in French novels about adultery, about improper relations between the sexes, about many things which the English public would not allow.","Contemporary literature in the West has shown some signs of ethical change.","But the history of the changes produced by a universal idea is not a history of changes in the individual, but of changes brought about by the successive efforts of millions of individuals in the course of many generations.","But every great scripture, whether Hebrew, Indian, Persian, or Chinese, apart from its religious value will be found to have some rare and special beauty of its own; and in this respect the original Bible stands very high as a monument of sublime poetry and of artistic prose.","At last, in 1611, was made, under the auspices of King James, the famous King James version; and this is the great literary monument of the English language.","As a result, the highly civilized man can endure incomparably more than the savage, whether of moral or physical strain. Being better able to control himself under all circumstances, he has a great advantage over the savage.","Any idealism is a proper subject for art.","Accordingly the Northern races of Europe found their inspiration in the Bible; and the enthusiasm for it has not yet quite faded away.","A proof of really great art is that it is generally true - it seldom falls into the misapprehensions to which minor art is liable."],"Laila Ali":["If you knew you could change your lifestyle and diet and avoid heart disease and other things, you should do it.","Authenticity is very important - be true to one's self.","Focus on being balanced - success is balance.","While I was boxing professionally, I never thought about my looks. The furthest thing from my mind was 'messing up my pretty face' when I was on my way to the ring to meet my opponent. Yet, people I'd meet along the way would always ask me if I was worried about my looks. Then they would go on to say that I was 'too pretty to box.'","People who are fit are the same as anyone else. The only difference is their level of commitment. If looking good and being fit was easy, everyone would do it! Most people don't want to put in the work or make the sacrifices needed in order to be fit.","I'm a professional world champion. Of course if you're a world champion, you're working harder than everybody else. You're making the commitment, and you're making the sacrifices. If it were easy, everybody would be able to do it. Everybody would be able to be world champion, but everybody can't be. Everybody doesn't have it in them.","You have to fight for your health and stay on top of it. Our bodies are meant to be healthy.","I understand that the average person can't imagine damaging their looks in any way if it could be avoided. But I don't value my physical beauty to the point where I would not do something I truly enjoy because I'm afraid of potentially hurting something superficial.","My father loves people. No matter what their race, no matter what their position in life, he treated everyone with kindness and love and respect. And that was instilled in me just by watching him.","I do my best to work out 5 days a week. There are times when I can only get in 3 days a week because I am traveling or just need rest due to a hectic schedule. But working out is always a priority, and if I fall off due to my schedule, it is not long before I get back on track.","My dad lived by example. I lived by watching him. I watched all the great things he did and said. I try to walk that talk for my children.","Everybody wants recognition, but we can't all get it.","I want to encourage women to take control of their health.","I was never offended that people underestimated me because of my appearance or that they thought I was pretty and discouraged me from fighting because they didn't want me to risk hurting my looks.","'All in With Laila Ali' is educational, inspirational, compelling programming profiling individuals that have reached for the sky, pushed themselves to the limit and did things that you would think were impossible.","I think that if you do want to be a fighter, then you need to work harder than everybody else and make sure that you surround yourself with good people, especially if you're a woman. You've got to find a team that takes you seriously as a female fighter and is not going to rush you into the ring before you're ready.","I saw women's boxing on television for the first time when I was 18, and that's when I wanted to do it. So, it didn't come from me watching my father. I didn't know the sport existed; therefore, I wasn't really interested in it until I saw it.","I never intended to box forever, and always planned to move on to do other things.","I don't really try to tell people whether they should fight. It's definitely not for everybody.","I love engaging in conversation with other moms because we can relate to one another, and we swap valuable insight and information.","I'm private in the sense that I like my personal space and only want people in the parts of my business that I choose to share. Anything I feel is too personal to share publicly, I keep to myself.","My kids know the importance of being active - and that's why teaming up with the USTA was such an organic fit for me. They are making strives to get families outside - and using tennis as a way to get kids to stay active.","I have to get a workout in in the morning. Once my day starts, I'll have the best intentions, and it still won't happen: one of the kids needs to be picked up somewhere, I have to hop on a conference call, or I'm just tired. So I get it done in the A.M.","I think that the greatest lesson I learned from my father is just having compassion towards people.","People like to see me fight. A name can only take you so far. There are only a few fighters out of the thousands of boxers out there that have name recognition. I'm definitely not upset by that.","My dad is a comedian, entertainer, you know. He always likes to make people laugh. With me, it just depends on what mood I'm in. You get what you get.","Running is my time for myself. I'm like, 'I'm going for a run!' and my husband knows I'm out of there.","All fighters run. The constant motion prepares you for being in the ring. And running strengthens your legs. Punching power comes from your lower body.","I wasn't in shape at all before I decided to do boxing. I wasn't an athlete. Before boxing, I would go to the gym for a month and stop.","I never ran with my dad. He was old-school. He had a whole different idea of training. He ran in steel-toed boots! But, of course, he's proud of me and proud of the boxer that I became.","I like to play by my own rules.","Since I was a child, my father was sick. I've always known him to be that way. That's why I'm proud of him - he has a disease he's obviously struggling with, but he's not letting it stop him from doing what he wants to do.","We shared our father with the world.","I've had people in the family, male and female, impacted by heart disease. But people can prevent it.","I don't like crazy names. I don't like them. I don't think it makes any sense. You have to think about the child and, as they get older, what they have to deal with. A lot of people do things as a fad, and they want to get some attention, but it's like, this is your child.","Anyone who's seen me before knows that when it's fight time, I don't have much to say.","I'm Muhammad Ali's daughter, but my father and I are very different in that area. I don't necessarily try to put on a show. That's what my father's thing was, and he was great at it. Everything I say is because I feel it, and it comes out of my mouth. It's not scripted.","I'm not one of those women who's like pro women. I'm an individual, and I'm in an individual sport. So I see everyone as individuals, not as male or female.","I don't play video games. My husband does. He plays sometimes the football, and every once in a while when he gets bored, he'll do a little boxing in there. He gets into the football. You can trade players, and he keeps up with the whole aspect of the game, not just the game. He's a fanatic.","I'm not a team sports person type person, so I probably would have been good at tennis, because I like tennis. But my parents really didn't push me. I think if my parents would have guided me and stay committed, I could have played any sport I wanted to, but I never did.","By being an athlete, I have uncovered so many other ways to express my beauty. Being a strong, fearless woman makes me feel beautiful. I love the way I look and feel when I am two hours into my training and my skin is glistening with sweat and my clothes are drenched because I have given it all I've got.","My dad is an excellent grandfather. He loves kids. He loves to kiss them to death.","Pregnancy isn't 'I can eat whatever I want,' because you have to remember you're going to be stuck with a lot of that weight afterwards that you need to try to get off.","I have cravings all the time, even when I'm not pregnant."],"Laila Robins":["I've paid my dues in the classical trenches.","I feel very close to Maryann Plunkett and Jay O. Sanders.","A lot of my training is in classical theatre; I've done a lot of classical plays in New York and also at the Guthrie and here and there across the country.","One day, when I was 33, I shifted. I suddenly saw acting as a higher calling. I understood that my goal was to serve the play. And I realized if an actor can make audiences' hearts resonate or make them question their values - that's an important thing to do!","I often feel that when people have affairs, it has more to do with something they're searching for in themselves than anything else.","Because I was from the Midwest and untrained, I was completely open and ready to try anything. Many of my classmates were cynical and jaded; some already had conservatory training, and they were there simply to get that Yale stamp of approval, which they saw as a career stepping-stone.","It has always been a dream of mine to put a play on film.","Often I play, especially on television, a lot of smart lawyer people and cerebral types.","That's always a fun thing to play, a relationship where there's equals. I often play roles that are repressive, or women who are slightly repressed or having some kind of internal conflict.","'Heartbreak House' was a lot of fun for me. I must have missed that day at school. I'd never read it or seen it. It's one of those things that a lot of people are familiar with.","Tennessee Williams is an incredible writer for women because, in many ways, his women characters are him. He writes so passionately.","A lot of times you come against actors who come from a different direction, and you tend to meet in the middle.","I want to work with Cherry Jones.","It's funny, oftentimes the really great roles that I enjoy are in classic plays, and there aren't many theatres in New York who will do them, aside from Roundabout.","I'd rather do a great play than a mediocre play in New York. As much as I'd like to be seen in New York, that's not my driving motivation. My motivation is to play great roles, wherever they happen.","I did nine months in 'Mrs. Klein' in New York, then four months on the road. Then I did a movie directed by Philip Haas, who did 'Angels & Insects'. We shot 'The Blood Oranges' in Mexico for six weeks."],"Laini Taylor":["The main thing I've learned is that we all have to learn to work with - and appreciate - the brain we've been given, and not waste time wishing things were easier.","When you are young, hone your craft and write shorter pieces instead of novels, because it's really hard to finish a novel.","The biggest challenge for me has been in coping with my perfectionism. I have a stiflingly hard time moving forward in a project if it's not 'just right' all along the way. The trap I so easily fall into is rewriting and rewriting the same scenes over and over to make them perfect, instead of continuing on into the wild unknown of the story.","Never sit staring at a blank page or screen. If you find yourself stuck, write. Write about the scene you're trying to write. Writing about is easier than writing, and chances are, it will give you your way in.","When I turned to writing fantasy, and writing for young people, it was joyous. It was like discovering an underground lake of ideas that went on forever.","I started blogging in 2006 when I had sold my first novel but it had not yet been published, in those anxious months in between while I learned the whole process.","I've always been a reader and a writer.","I think with world building, it's important to create a sense of culture even if it is just a fantasy, and the best way to do that is to look at a real human culture and see what makes it cohesive.","It's easy to get published once you have written a really good book and the hard part, 99 percent of what you need to worry about, is really finishing it.","The sooner you learn to finish things, and as a matter of course finish your creative endeavors, the better. It took me a long time to learn that.","During my second draft pass on my last book I made 20,000 words happen in a week, which is practically supernatural for me, and it would never have been possible without three nights in a hotel in my own city.","Dialogue is the place that books are most alive and forge the most direct connection with readers. It is also where we as writers discover our characters and allow them to become real."],"Lainie Kazan":["I'd seen all the great entertainers by the time I was 14 or 15. My mother was artistic. My father was a bookmaker, so he had access to all those nightclubs, and he was smitten by certain artists, and we would go see them. We'd see comics like Sid Caesar and Milton Berle - those kind of artists - many of whom I worked with later in my life.","I'm an exercise and yoga junkie and I feel good.","I have a rich, full, textured life.","I was a student of Sanford Meisner for three years at the Neighborhood Playhouse, and I studied with Lee Strasburg for five years and became a member of the Actors Studio. What I studied came right from the horse's mouth. My students have a lot to learn from me, and I am so eager to share it.","I went to a lot of theatre. My parents were very involved with the performing arts. I went to nightclub shows when I was a little girl. We went to Florida and we would go to the Cocoanut Grove down there. We'd go see Lena Horne, Jimmy Durante, Sophie Tucker and Judy Garland.","I love singing. It's who I am. When I act, I take a small part of myself and just magnify it, but when I'm singing, that's who I am. I don't write music, so I choose songs that I would have written."],"Laird Barron":["During my adolescence, our family dwelt in rural Alaska. We were dirt poor, Depression-era poor. Tarpaper shack and kerosene lamps. In those days I read because that's all I had. I wrote because that's all I had.","My paternal grandfather was a failed novelist. He stacked boxes of rejected manuscripts in a closet.","Mom and Dad were bibliophiles. Dad shared his father's love of westerns, Mom favored the likes of Zelazny and Heinlein, Howard and Burroughs. We owned several hundred books stored in trunks that comprised our portable library.","Mom was all about hellfire and brimstone. Her Old Testament God was a colossal, ancient brute, a maelstrom of blood and fire, of appetite and wrath."],"Laisenia Qarase":["A well balanced, inclusive approach, according to certain standards and ideals, is essential for the proper governance of any country.","I have always felt that public, commercial and community organisations should be as open as possible about their affairs. They need to be accountable to their owners, their customers, their members and communities and other interest groups."],"Lajos Egri":["Immortality. We all want to be remembered: We want to do things that will make people say, 'Isn't he wonderful?'","Everything has a purpose or premise. Every second of our life has its own premise, whether or not we are conscious of it at the time. That premise may be as simple as breathing or as complex as a vital emotional decision, but it is always there.","No, you don't have to start your play with a premise. You can start with a character or an incident, or even a simple thought. This thought or incident grows, and the story slowly unfolds itself. You have time to find your premise in the mass of your material later. The important thing is to find it.","No two dramatists think or write alike. Ten thousand playwrights can take the same premise, as they have done since Shakespeare, and not one play will resemble the other except in the premise. Your knowledge, your understanding of human nature, and your imagination will take care of that.","Although you should never mention your premise in the dialogue of your play, the audience must know what the message is. And whatever it is, you must prove it."],"Lajos Kossuth":["Even in political considerations, now-a-days, you have stronger motives to feel interested in the fate of Europe than in the fate of the Central or Southern parts of America.","Hungary is, in a word, in a state of WAR against the Hapsburg dynasty, a war of legitimate defence, by which alone it can ever regain independence and freedom.","I can understand Communism, but not Socialism.","The policy of the house of Austria, which aimed at destroying the independence of Hungary as a state, has been pursued unaltered for three hundred years.","The principle of evil in Europe is the enervating spirit of Russian absolutism.","The power that is supported by force alone will have cause often to tremble.","The house of Austria has publicly used every effort to deprive the country of its legitimate Independence and Constitution, designing to reduce it to a level with the other provinces long since deprived of all freedom, and to unite all in a common sink of slavery.","The time draws near, when a radical change must take place for the whole world in the management of diplomacy.","Men like me, who merely wish to establish political freedom, will in such circumstances lose all their influence, and others will get influence who may become dangerous to all established interests whatsoever.","I consider no man honest who does not observe towards other nations the principles which he desires to be observed towards his own: and therefore I will not interfere in your domestic questions.","My nomination to be Governor was not to gratify ambition.","The Hungarian ministry begged the king earnestly to issue orders to all troops and commanders of fortresses in Hungary, enjoining fidelity to the Constitution, and obedience to the ministers of Hungary.","Upon this the Hungarian ministers resigned, but the names submitted by the president of the council, at the demand of the king, were not approved of for successors.","If I had undertaken the practical direction of military operations, and anything went amiss, I feared that my conscience would torture me, as guilty of the fall of my country, as I had not been familiar with military tactics.","In exile, I have tried to profit by the past and prepare for the future.","I believe that the confidence of Hungary in me is not shaken by misfortune nor broken by my calumniators.","You must be a power on earth, and must therefore accept all the consequences of this position.","Now that I am a deputy, I will cease to be an agitator.","I will not become a Napoleon nor an Alexander, and labour for my own ambition; but I will labour for freedom and for the moral well-being of man.","Neutrality, as a lasting principle, is an evidence of weakness.","In my opinion, the form of Government may be different in different countries, according to their circumstances, their wishes, their wants. England loves her Queen, and has full motive to do so.","Now since France has three times in sixty years failed to obtain practical results from Political revolutions, all Europe is apt to press forward into new Social doctrine to regulate the future.","Yet my humble capacity has not preserved me from calumnies.","I have to thank the People, the Congress, and the Government of the United States for my liberation.","Your generous part in my liberation is taken by the world for the revelation of the fact, that the United States are resolved not to allow the despots of the world to trample on oppressed humanity.","I am a straightforward man.","I came not to your glorious shores to enjoy a happy rest - I came not to gather triumphs of personal distinction, but as a humble petitioner, in my country's name, as its freely chosen constitutional leader, to entreat your generous aid.","I must therefore implore your indulgence for a pretty long and plain development of my views concerning that cause which the citizens of New York, and you particularly, gentlemen, honour with generous interest.","And if you cannot remain indifferent, you must resolve to throw your weight into that balance in which the fate and condition of man is weighed.","It is chiefly in New York that I feel induced to urge this, because New York is, by innumerable ties, connected with Europe - more connected than several parts of Europe itself.","The unspoken word never does harm."],"Lake Bell":["The finest lesson I've learned with age is that all I need is a small team of comrades who inspire me, try not to judge me, and remind me when I'm judging myself.","My mom is incredibly stylish, and she gets it from my grandmother. I feel like I can't live up to how chic they are as women. They are great role models for aging gracefully, and that's a thing that is very key that I try to always emulate.","Filmmaking is a huge privilege; it's not brain surgery. It's art, and art is supposed to be an enjoyable process, and it is an enjoyable experience for me.","Before you have kids, you're like, 'I hope I don't die on this plane,' or, 'I hope I don't die crossing the street.' It's all me, me, me. 'What do I want to eat? What do I want to do?' But when you have a baby, and you would just happily stand in front of a bus to save her, it's a ferocious commitment to protecting your charge.","I have this necklace I always wear. I collect pendants from people I love; my best friends and members of my family have all given me one, and I put them on this chain so no matter where I am they're always with me.","I think, in general, when you're doing comedy, you're having a good time regardless of the comedy table tennis that you're playing. I think you want that, too: you're rooting for two characters to be together, and you should feel that even when they're angry at each other, they're still in synch with each other.","When I was pregnant, I was like, 'I'm pregnant, so I'm allowed to eat everything: bagels with cream cheese for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and I can have pizza for dessert.'","You have to keep hobbies in L.A. Otherwise, it's sad.","I'm organized, but receipts tend to mess up my system. They're barbarians! So I store them in a notepad.","I like my body, I like to have fun with what I put on, but I also want to remain classic. So I guess my signature is sexy and eclectic but classic.","When you have a little one, you realize that your only mission in life is to protect this helpless, very sensitive creature. That is your charge. That's primal. I relate to that deeply.","My happy place is holding my daughter and my husband in the same hug. It really is. I'm getting emotional just thinking about it. I consider it such a privilege, and I know that I'm lucky. I never want to take it for granted.","You can't live in a dialect without tremendous work. Like any muscle, accents and voices and languages are all formed out of the muscles that we have in our mouths and faces and tongues.","My mother, Robin Bell, is the master of balancing the finite line between classic and creative when it comes to fashion. Mom has no qualms about unleashing the pinking shears on a vintage Givenchy dress if it means she'll wear it more once it's sleeveless.","I am lactose intolerant, and I always thought it was really funny how people who are lactose intolerant continue to eat dairy, because they like it so much. And I find it not acceptable.","I lean into all things that are a little off. I will always wear overalls. At this point, I find a way in most of my life to wear a jumpsuit or an overall, anything that's sort of like an all-in-one situation. I do that on the red carpet a lot.","I feel that being an actor is a front-row seat into seeing how everybody else makes their movies. Basically, being in the trenches for ten years is like a college-level course in filmmaking if not more. It feels like every director I work with and every set that I visit as an actor, I see someone else's definition of filmmaking.","I love fashion. I always have. When I was a kid, I was in almost full-on costumes when I went to school, and I've retained a bit of that in my adulthood.","There are a lot of funny people and a lot of unfunny people. Some of them are women and some of them are dudes.","I find the female tragedy of insecurity to be hilarious. We get obsessed over issues like the tiny skin tags on our backs or that we're fat. You read one line in a magazine and it sends you into a tailspin.","Actually, in my own life I think I probably feign neuroses to be more interesting than I am.","I think coming to work and being absurd and neurotic and thoughtful at the same time is far more interesting.","I'm vegan on home base, but when I travel to other countries, I throw it all into the garbage.","But I'd say 'How to Make It in America' is the most accurate depiction of the New York hipster community on television for sure.","My dad's a Jew, and my mom's a WASP, so that should pretty much say it all. It was a comically dysfunctional family.","I did accents and funny voices for the family when I was growing up.","The two things that hit you when you meet someone are, first, how they're visually put together and then, what they tell you with the tone of their voice - whether or not they're to be taken seriously.","When you write and direct your own film, you basically know exactly what you want. Or you hope to. For the studio, it actually can make life a little easier, because if you have a bunch of questions, they only need to call one person.","I'm super and very openly obsessed with voice-over. 'In a World...' was my love letter to the industry of voice-over. And in a way, I sometimes think of it as a 93-minute audition to the voice-over industry to say, 'Hey. Consider me!'","I am somebody who is constantly hungry to nibble on something.","I was a commercial girl. In drama school, I was a mediocre model occasionally to pick up some extra cash, and because clearly I'm not six feet tall, and I had baby weight, I would mainly just would do promotional stuff.","I certainly felt like my life had been enriched and had also changed forever when I took 'In A World...' to Sundance.","My brother and I had many games. We were inseparable. We had a little team going on between us. We had even a language that was kind of like pig latin. So we'd speak in the language. It's called Op.","I collect handkerchiefs. I know that's sort of old-timey, but my mom started the collection for me, and now I have a bunch. Basically, I have a myriad of beautiful handkerchiefs, and I carry them like a grandmother in my purse. And I opt for hankies in any situation.","I consider myself a good layman's cook. Ninety percent of the time, I'm successful with what I set out to make, and I can improvise. Yes, I own a mandoline. Yes, we have a Vitamix.","At the end of the week, my husband and I do a leftovers dinner, where we have to use whatever's in the fridge. It's sort of a game.","I hate bell peppers, which is annoying because they technically have my name all over them.","'Wet Hot American Summer' was sort of lowbrow genius, you know? But smart in its cultish silliness. It wasn't considered something of great cultural caliber. But like many cult pieces, it sort of became something culturally relevant, which I think is what's so wonderful about it.","At a time when every series we're supposed to be DVR-ing is very important, very serious, has to do with heavy, heavy matters, I think 'Wet Hot' provides a respite to that DVR homework. It's totally the gummy bears of your programming.","My mother is a beautiful writer. Writing letters back and forth with her was an athletic endeavor, and it became something I really looked forward to.","If I write something, and I'm going to put in all that love and energy, I want to direct it.","Marriage is traditionally old-school in many respects. It is highly antiquated, and, that being said, beautiful.","Having children is not for everyone, but I think it's a beautiful lesson in it not being all about me anymore. It's a relief, in a way. It's like, this is her story now, and I'm her mom. It's a nice shift.","'In A World...' changed my life a thousand per cent. I feel thankful that something I believed in so much - I love dialect, so I dedicated five years of my life to making a film about it - yielded such rewards. It led to 'Man Up,' as well as 'No Escape,' which comes out later this year... two movies where I am the female lead.","I think the key to a great romcom is to not fight against the genre. The trend more recently has been to apologise or be snarky, so it's an anti-romcom. Just lean in and embrace the fact it's a love story, and it's funny, and it's light. It can still be uber-smart and deal with zeitgeist issues.","I'm forever writing, forever looking for something to direct or produce, and always on the hunt for a great role.","I think part of what I love about being an actor is getting to take on different worlds and investigate different genres and travel to different lands.","I feel very lucky that when I'm burnt out of acting, I take to the pen, and I write something I want to direct. And then, when I'm tired of taking on too much responsibility as a director, I then look for an acting gig. And I've made it very clear that I'm interested in voiceover work. I mean, I'm always looking for voiceover gigs. I love that.","I'll be totally honest in that I feel tremendously lucky that I am offered incredible jobs all the time to direct, but the problem that I have just personally is that there are only so many years in my life to dedicate to certain projects.","I think of myself as a content creator and, hopefully one day, a content enabler and supporter of others, so that's what my immediate and hopefully future journey is.","I don't really enjoy working in TV, to be completely honest. Even though it's incredibly lucrative, I'm just terrified of not being satiated in a myriad of different ways.","Anything that is profoundly energy-shifting - like having a child - is fodder for creative thought. So for me, I welcome it and look straight into it as something to learn from.","There are so many projects on my Dream List. I have so many things in the works, just like little ideas or collections of things or things I write or even just a title of something.","There have been times where you do the red carpet in a certain shoe, and you go into the bathroom, you take that shoe off, you put the other shoe on from your purse, and then you walk around for the rest of the night.","I think the greatest privilege you have as an artist is time to nurture what you want to make; that's super luxurious. For you to rush into something, that doesn't feel fun to me. I'm living life in order to be able to write about it.","I feel very comfortable with my trajectory because I do have a life; I can go on the subway, you know? And I've been able to do that my entire career, and I have friends who are huge movie stars and can't go on the subway, and I feel like that sucks.","What I think is sad about the rom-com genre is that it has adopted this pejorative title. I think the reason why there haven't been as many great ones is because we are fighting against the genre itself. If it is a romantic comedy then snuggle up to the fact that it can be a really earnest, refreshing feeling to feel good after a movie.","I love accents in general. I'm obsessed with dialects, and I had to write a whole movie about it called 'In a World...'","My fiance likes drawing on napkins, which I save. I'm always scared I'll get caught taking a linen napkin from a restaurant!","I have vitamins I intend to take to be a better person. I even have a pillbox for them to remind myself to be healthier. But will I take them? Definitely not.","I love Dr. Hauschka's blue mascara. It's not so blue that it's like, 'What's wrong with you?' It's more like a secret that you're wearing it.","I have a weird obsession with wearing not just fashion sneakers, but actual sneakers that have bounce, because I want to feel like I'm in an active state.","Most of my characters are an amalgamation of people that I've met, my family, or myself. Being a writer, you can draw only from what you know. I am lucky to have really rich and interesting people in my family for, you know, interesting family nights and great characters.","I've always been very in tune to my voice and to other people's voices and how they express themselves vocally. And I always loved accents and dialects - I collected them like stamps.","I went to drama school in England, and you spend your first year working on the muscles surrounding the vocal mechanisms. You learn how you support it and create characters through your voice so that became an obsession. So I went to Hollywood thinking, 'Oh, I'm going to be one of the great voice-over artists.'","The only thing I liked about Christmas as a kid was the gifts; otherwise, it just seemed like a stressful time.","While marriage is historically associated with dire obligation and clipped wings, I've found that it actually liberates you to take on adventure and achieve your dreams. I like to call my husband 'my person.' Find your 'person,' and you can do anything!"],"Lakhdar Brahimi":["In Rwanda that genocide happened because the international community and the Security Council refused to give, again, another 5000 troops which would have cost, I don't know, maybe fifty, a hundred, million dollars.","In the globalized world that is ours, maybe we are moving towards a global village, but that global village brings in a lot of different people, a lot of different ideas, lots of different backgrounds, lots of different aspirations.","What again I tell my people is that no matter how much you know, it's never enough. You will always discover, after the fact, that you've missed something.","Several million people inside and outside Afghanistan are destitute and desperately in need of help.","The events of September 11 and what has happened since have made people understand that even a small, distant and far away country like Afghanistan cannot be left to break up into anarchy and chaos without consequences for the whole world.","People now realize that globalization is not only for the multi-nationals and the circulation of money.","There is a story which is not being told strongly enough of the Afghan employees of the UN inside the country who are saving hundreds of thousands of lives everyday by their bravery and nobody talks of them.","However, it does seem now that the international community, more importantly the powers that have influence, and, even more importantly, Afghanistan's neighbors realize that it is high time that they work together, and not against one another.","It also seems that the Afghans themselves want to avail themselves of this opportunity and all recognize that the UN is uniquely qualified to help bring them together.","The third point is that for some time the UN has been talking about helping Afghanistan in the reconstruction of the country but there has never been any real commitment by the international community to provide resources for that.","There is a firm, clear commitment to provide resources and ideas to enable us to organize the Afghans towards starting the process of rehabilitation and reconstruction.","Probably I understand very much the people who rise against injustice.","There is also a natural and very, very strong empathy with the underdog, with people who have suffered, people who have been pushed around by foreigners in particular, but also by their own people.","Of course the UN brings in a lot of moral authority.","The mandate you go with is intimidating and also is a source of respect that you gain, because you have come with this mandate from the United Nations.","There is an expression now that is commonly used about these so-called internal conflicts which are not really internal, because they have connections to the outside world.","Afghanistan is a land-locked country.","A fly cannot go in unless it stops somewhere; therefore weapons, fuel, food, money will not go to Afghanistan unless the neighbors of Afghanistan are working, are cooperating, either being themselves the origin or the transit.","But I knew that what had happened was an eye-opener not only to the United States but also to Pakistan, who realized that after what has happened on the 11th of September, it was simply impossible to continue to play those games in Afghanistan.","To leave Afghanistan as a playground for terrorists and adventurers was simply not possible anymore.","So, the international community are all the countries that are important: the United States definitely everywhere; the European Union because it is very important, and also, they do show a great deal of international responsibility; and then the local players.","There is an element of luck, there is an element of trial and error, sometimes you fail, sometimes you succeed. It's not as beautifully simple as it may seem when we are talking about it.","There again, that is a fundamental principle: no two situations are alike.","When you go from one place to another, you go with experience, you don't go with prescriptions.","You are dealing with people who have taken the responsibility of killing their own because they think that they are right, they think that they are serving the interests of their people. They not going to give that up easily, just because you've shown up.","I think a failed state is the responsibility of the people who have made that state fail, and those are generally the people of that country.","Iraq is a country that has been invaded. It's not a failing state that you want to help. It's a country that was functioning good or bad, with a horrible dictator, but you have invaded.","But you are absolutely right that when the international community decides to help in a meaningful manner a country like Afghanistan, then coordination between the various actors that are involved in these processes is very, very difficult indeed.","Somebody was asking me the other day - President Bush is now talking about freedom for the Arab world. I say, well, that's great. I was talking about that fifty years ago.","At times one feels that what is being said in the West is that the fact that you are a Muslim predisposes you to this blind, stupid terrorism.","If you are talking about terrorism, you need to sit down and understand what is making these people put dynamite around their waists and blow themselves up.","Be modest, be respectful of others, try to understand.","But you've got to understand what the other guy is about, even if at the end of the process you decide that there is no ground with this man or woman except to fight them."],"Lakshmi Mittal":["The torch relay is an excellent embodiment of all that the Olympic Games have come to symbolise - a celebration of the human spirit. Personally to me, it represents striving to be the best in whatever we do, never giving up despite the odds, and a commitment to health and fitness.","This is a learning in the business life that first of all you need to have commitment, dedication and passion for what you are doing.","When I think about parallels between myself and an Olympian, I believe that success in the world of business is underpinned by very similar principles of perseverance and hard work.","At the end of the day you have to keep emotions away.","It's true that I run a multi-national group but I have no interests in India. So please tell me, what should my identity be?","We are beginning to see the benefits of global consolidation.","We are not in the business of iron ore. Whatever captive iron ore sources we have, we use it to make steel.","I built a steel plant from the grassroots, so I learned all the nuts and bolts. When there was a problem, I would be able to guide them, though I am not a technical person.","I came from a Hindi medium school... the principal felt that I would not fit into an English medium college. Though I was top in my class in school, and I got admission in other colleges, but I really wanted to study in St. Xavier's."],"Lakshmi Pratury":["Maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy, and not a financial one. A value for things with a personal touch - an autographed book, a soul-searching letter.","I've seen the power of the community. A young person can stand up, talk about his dream, and someone from the audience will come forth to help him make that dream come true. Great things can happen when you place the right ideas before the right audience!","We've been brought up to pick one thing in life and become really good at just that. But that's never what I wanted to be. I was always interested in many things at the same time, and I wanted to try all of them at the same time, too.","When you are allowed to study different disciplines, you redefine your idea of success. You learn to appreciate multiple disciplines simultaneously and you learn that there is no one formula to anything.","I'm looking for people who are at the cutting edge of what they do, who think out-of-the-box. Even if their work is something common today, it might have been absolutely new when they started out, so we'd like to hear of their beginnings."],"Lal Bahadur Shastri":["The unique thing about our country is that we have Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, and people of all other religions. We have temples and mosques, gurdwaras and churches. But we do not bring all this into politics... This is the difference between India and Pakistan.","It is most regrettable that nuclear energy is being harnessed for making nuclear weapons.","India will have to hang down her head in shame if even one person is left who is said in any way to be untouchable.","Discipline and united action are the real source of strength for the nation.","We would consider it our moral duty to lend all support to the ending of colonialism and imperialism so that people everywhere are free to mould their own destiny.","We must fight for peace bravely as we fought in war.","I had always been feeling uncomfortable in my mind about giving advice to others and not acting upon it myself.","There comes a time in the life of every nation when it stands at the crossroads of history and must choose which way to go.","No doubt we have to have bigger projects, bigger industries, basic industries, but it is a matter of the highest importance that we look to the common man, the weakest element in the society.","We believe in peace in the settlement of all disputes through peaceful means, in the abolition of war, and, more particularly, nuclear war.","We believe in the dignity of man as an individual, whatever his race, colour or creed, and his right to better, fuller, and richer life.","We believe in freedom, freedom for the people of each country to follow their destiny without external interference.","I am not as simple as I look.","We have to surmount the difficulties that face us and work steadfastly for the happiness and prosperity of our country.","We believe in peace and peaceful development, not only for ourselves but for people all over the world.","Our country has often stood like a solid rock in the face of common danger, and there is a deep underlying unity which runs like a golden thread through all our seeming diversity.","Non-alignment will continue to be the fundamental basis of our approach to world problems and our relations with other countries.","We can win respect in the world only if we are strong internally and can banish poverty and unemployment from our country.","We cannot afford to spend millions and millions over nuclear arms when there is poverty and unemployment all around us.","We are a very big and vast Government, and naturally, every ministry is becoming bigger and bigger. It becomes, therefore, essential that there should be proper coordination.","If Pakistan has any ideas of annexing any part of our territories by force, she should think afresh. I want to state categorically that force will be met with force and aggression against us will never be allowed to succeed.","The speed with which we in the Congress are going down is sometimes frightening. Government administration in the districts is rapidly reaching a low level. No strong opposition party has been able to emerge.","Our way is straight and clear - the building up of a socialist democracy at home, with freedom and prosperity for all, and the maintenance of world peace and friendship with all nations abroad.","I tremble when I am reminded of the fact that I have to be in charge of this country and Parliament, which had been led by no less a person than Jawaharlal Nehru.","There has no doubt to be fundamental research in science, but applied research is equally important for new improvements and changes in our techniques."],"Lalaine":["My fashion statement depends on my mood. I am more of a tomboy when dressing up, and I have never worn pink in my entire life.","My singing led into acting, and that is how I discovered acting.","There have been times when people who weren't my friends all of a sudden became my friend. I won't allow them to use me, but I have been pretty lucky to have friends who have supported me and who I have known since I was 12. They are still the same and they don't treat me any different.","My music does say a lot about me and what I went through. All the songs are about things I have gone through and what I am thinking. I wrote about my family, friends and boys, of course, and about life.","I say I have Spanish in me, but I'm not just Spanish. I'm proud of my ethnicities, and I will always be proud of being a Filipino.","I'm a jeans person; I love Abercrombie. My shoe collection is composed mostly of Chucks and a few pairs of girly ones."],"Lalla Ward":["I enjoyed the promotion with K9 on my introduction day.","Although the French were very friendly and helpful. On one location we were to film at the top of the Eiffel Tower but we couldn't, as it was so misty with four inches of snow on the ground. We couldn't see a thing but we finally got it done.","Don't ask me who my favourite monster was because I'm sick of saying Tom Baker.","I can't bear it that Douglas isn't still here.","I had an awful lot to say in what I wore as Romana.","I like that totally mixed up kind of eclectic group of personal props and bits of costume and I think the fun of doing that is where I was very lucky with Doctor Who.","I mean, I was first offered Princess Astra.","I think Douglas was a real one-off. He was so clever and so intelligent and so well read in real science that he could make science fiction work as well as it did. And just such fun to have around, he was just such a lovely man.","I think the kind of unexpected I really love is when you open books and the actual way of writing is different and interesting. Like reading Virginia Woolf for the first time or Lawrence Durrell for the first time.","I was quite happy with the way I went, I think.","Oh, I have to say Romana; she was much more fun to do but I did enjoy the Princess when she was turning bad.","One of the advantages of appearing in such a play is that you begin to understand it properly, I feel Ophelia's tragedy was that she had been so used by everybody and felt that she bore a great burden of guilt.","We were only there for five days and during that time Tom was a bit annoyed that the French were more interested in me and my schoolgirl outfit than him and his long scarf."],"Lalu Prasad Yadav":["If you do not milk the cow fully, it falls sick.","Everyone should play their role in tearing down the wall of hatred.","Musharraf is a good man and wants to improve relations with India.","In my view, Indian Railways has immense untapped potential.","My mother always told me not to handle a buffalo by its tail, but always catch it by its horns. And I have used that lesson in everything in my life, including the Railways.","I know some people say I can be funny. But there is always a deeper meaning to what I say. I am a socialist at heart and have the interests of the poor in mind. When people see how I manage to work my way out of tough situations, it gives them hope in their own life.","For the first time in the history of Bihar, I provided a stable government. Despite being denied funds by the Centre, Bihar survived on its resources. I provided pucca dwellings to half a million Dalit families.","In a democracy, power is not permanent.","The lower caste people were killed as part of a conspiracy to dismiss my party's government.","We recognised Urdu as the second official language and made it a medium of examination in all Bihar Public Service Commission tests.","In politics, everybody is free to choose his friends and allies.","I work so much. If I don't get all the comforts, I will turn mad.","Why should I tell you where I am going to get funds from? If I were to do that then all the vested interests would get alerted. You must be aware that railways are full of such elements and my fight is against them.","I do not rule out the possibility of being prime minister of India one day, but there is still time.","It is because of me that today the union government has sanctioned special funds for the development of Bihar.","Today in India there are all sections of people, as the BJP realized when the poor voted them out.","Our mass movement will shatter this communal, fascist and autocratic center.","The Sangh Parivar, against which I had been waging a war, misled the people. My opponents used the Election Commission and the bureaucracy to win a political battle."],"Lamar Alexander":["As Governor, I could think of only one way to unify our State that was made up of so many different climates, political beliefs and people, and that was our music.","I think we do better as a country when we go step by step toward a goal, and the goal in this case should be reducing health care costs.","I need to know the price of a gallon of milk and a dozen eggs. I need to know right now.","Sooner or later, I need to begin to do what any candidate does in a presidential race; I need to begin to win.","It is a rare American who does not have some story about how music has made our lives richer and more interesting, how it has changed our moods, brought out the best in our character and even sometimes helped us earn a living.","September 11 is one of our worst days but it brought out the best in us. It unified us as a country and showed our charitable instincts and reminded us of what we stood for and stand for.","We are the only country in the world that has taken people from so many different backgrounds, which is a great achievement by itself, but an even greater achievement is that we have turned all of that variety and diversity into unity.","Put too many one-size-fits-all jackets on Americans and the place explodes.","The job of mayor and Governor is becoming more and more like the job of university president, which I used to be; it looks like you are in charge, but you are not.","We do all the appropriating. They do not do any of it down at the White House. They send a budget up here, and we don't have to pay any attention it to at all. We do what we want to do.","If Mr. Bush and Mr. Forbes don't get most of the votes, they should be arrested for wasting money.","There are a growing number of conservatives and Republicans who, while they support the president and support the war in Iraq, wonder how many of these nation-building wars we're going to engage in and what the parameters of that are.","The goal with a big piece of social legislation is to have a bipartisan result, so the country will accept it.","Well, here's what I think. I mean, the people are saying, 'We don't want it,' and the Democrats are saying, 'We don't care. We're going to pass it anyway.' And so for the next three months, Washington will be consumed with the Democrats trying to jam this through in a very messy procedure an unpopular health care bill.","If you have a solution to immigration, it is possible to come home and defend it.","The composition of the primary is so different than when I was first elected governor in 1978.","I think people are looking for a president who has views and who sticks to those views. So, I think Governor Romney, Governor Perry, Governor Huntsman are all terrific candidates. I think we got a chance to elect a real, executive leader.","I remember when President Bush, George W. Bush, came into office, he focused on No Child Left Behind, and with - and before very long, suddenly, Republicans were thought of as being as interested and as competent in education as Democrats, and why? Because they were talking about it and doing something about it.","I think higher education is over-regulated.","I think there are too many bosses in Washington telling Nashville Diesel College and Harvard University how to run - how to run their campuses, and I'd like to reduce the number of Washington regulations on higher education and keep this marketplace of wonderful institutions among which students can choose; that's oriented toward job growth.","I think Americans are - particularly, independent voters are looking at Washington, and they see too many taxes, too much spending, too much debt, too many Washington takeovers, and they want to provide a check and a balance to what they see as a runaway, overreaching Washington government.","When I was governor, I was looking for a way to unify our state. I realized music is about the only thing that unifies Tennessee.","President Bush and I had asked Congress to appropriate a half-billion dollars to school vouchers. We didn't get it, and we were disappointed. But we did not go out and form a corporation to pay for it. That would have been a problem.","If the administration asks for $5 and Congress appropriates $4, that's what they get. If the government creates a subterfuge by going outside the government to raise money through a private entity, that's a violation of the law.","Most people who get in trouble in politics usually get in trouble because they're disconnected from the people they serve, and I don't think anybody in Tennessee, even people who won't vote for me, would accuse me of that.","I love Washington, D.C.; I love this country, but I think over the last hundred years we've built up would I call an arrogant empire: people who think the rest of us are too stupid to make our own decisions.","Primarily, we need to change 100 years of thinking, where we try to extend the promise of American life by moving things to Washington, and let's move it the other way: less of Washington, more from ourselves.","I think, I think we need a Republican president from the real world to remind ourselves sometimes of what we need to do.","The main interest of most members of the Christian Coalition is the breakdown of the family. I think that's our biggest problem, and if the whole country was as concerned and active in issues of the family as members of the Christian Coalition are, we'd probably be better off as a country.","I think there's plenty of evidence that we need to stop spewing so much carbon into the air, that we're contributing to climate change and that we ought to look for alternatives.","To power the country by building 186,000 fifty-story wind turbines - and running 19,000 miles of new transmission lines - just seems impractical and preposterous compared to the idea of building a hundred new nuclear facilities primarily on the sites we already have.","We hear a lot about rebuilding Detroit, and we just spent $70 billion to bail out the auto industry - well, they need to be cost competitive, too. If they have high-cost energy, those suppliers are going to move to Japan or Mexico instead of Michigan and Tennessee.","When I get close to an election, I look to 'Lamar Alexander's Little Plaid Book' for inspiration.","I've got a new rule. It'll be rule No. 312. If it's three days before a campaign, don't believe anything new you hear about anybody.","In the Senate, where 60 votes are required to do anything important, you have to work with your colleagues on both sides of the aisle.","We've got a strong group of Republicans who are conservatives who know that their jobs aren't finished when they finish their speech."],"Lamar Hunt":["I get asked this a lot: Why has soccer not succeeded? My answer is, soccer has succeeded. It is already the fastest growing youth participation sport in the U.S. It has already succeeded at the youth level, no question.","You can't compare a Super Bowl crowd, which tends to be more polite and a little more neutral to that. The Super Bowl only has 7,000 to 8,000 fans for each team.","We literally had all 10 teams alive for a playoff position in the final week of the season. That outstanding balance and those close races created a major surge in attendance in the last month of the season.","He is not someone who went off to play in Europe and only a few Americans follow. He has the potential to be on magazine covers and more newspaper coverage.","I have no doubts that it will be a major sport-in the United States. I'm probably not going to live to see that day because Americans are a little afraid of getting interested in something at which they're not very good.","Well, we've made huge strides since the 1990 World Cup, USA '94, and obviously since '98. Unfortunately, those strides only register with the public once every four years.","The stadiums are like none I've ever seen. I think there must have been some strong competition nationally between Korea and Japan to make the best facilities because they are very well designed."],"Lamar Odom":["Negative publicity makes people forget your best times.","Respect goes a long way when you carry yourself a certain way and show manners when you first meet someone. If you do that, then it's hard for somebody not to like you.","Being humbled has been a part of my life for a long time.","The young men in the inner city are without guidance, robbing and shooting each other with no remorse... Our system is crazy because we're planning to fail. Everybody needs something to grasp on to.","The Lakers are family. My kids don't have to switch schools. Little things like that are important. People don't think about things like that. I feel like something special is going to happen in this town.","We all have regrets, but the thing is to learn from life.","I think it's easy for people to say, 'Because you do this, you must be this kind of person, vain or uptight or mean to people.' People have a sense of who you may be because of the job you do. That's unfair judgment.","I've got a winner mentality, the mentality of a champion.","My mother and grandmother raised me. Queens raised me.","Most people don't want to get married. Being married, that's a responsibility.","I don't want a girlfriend because that means I've got a responsibility. I have a responsibility to call you. I have a responsibility not to be with another woman. I have a responsibility to be there on time when you need me.","Death always seems to be around me.","When I had to bury my child, I probably didn't start grieving until a year and a half later.","I don't think nobody's doubting I can play basketball.","I consider myself a little weak.","The Mavericks and I have mutually agreed that it's in the best interest of both parties for me to step away from the team.","For years I've been seeing my young brothers wearing Scarface T-shirts, John Gotti T-shirts, Rick James T-shirts. We don't have any icons or idols to look up to, just rappers and professional athletes.","Remember when Jay-Z wore a Che Guevara T-shirt? Nobody knew who Che was. Then Jay-Z wears it, and it's everywhere.","Where I'm from, you're a square if you go to church or if you decide to read the Koran or Bible.","My grandmother was always upbeat, a naturally happy person. I think I got that from her.","I was going to fight for what I wanted first, and that was being in L.A. and being a Laker. L.A. was the first place that came to my mind. That's where my heart was at.","Organizations are trying to save extra money. Players are trying to get extra money. That's the way it is.","It's good that I put my personal ego aside. My basketball ego was, 'Why we negotiating?' But my personal ego didn't take it personal. I put my personal ego aside a little bit.","If your dad always has candy, how cool is he? Coolest dude in the world. My kids think I'm cool.","People making it like I sit there and eat a whole plate of candy before I play a basketball game. I don't think anyone could do that.","I'm going to say my favorite thing is to eat salads, and I'll be like the altar boy.","The Lakers have been nothing but great to me, and I want to keep the relationship great.","I have candy around my bed. I just kinda like reach over and eat it and then go back to sleep, no problem."],"Lamar S. Smith":["Judicial abuse occurs when judges substitute their own political views for the law.","I support basic research, which can lead to discoveries that change our world, expand our horizons and save lives.","The more energy-efficient we become as a nation, the less we need to develop additional energy sources.","The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, not freedom from religion.","Electricity is derived from many non-renewable energy sources like oil, natural gas and coal.","The Supreme Court is not elected, and it is therefore not a proper arbiter of social policy.","Nearly every study shows that competition from cheap foreign labor undercuts the wages of American workers and legal immigrants.","Conservation of energy also protects our environment.","Judges should interpret the law, not make it.","Congress has a responsibility to review research paid for by hard-working American taxpayers."],"Lamman Rucker":["Everything is a negotiation. Everything is a little bit of give and take.","When all is said and done, I want to die exhausted and empty because I gave everything that was in me. I believe that's why we're all here: to give of ourselves to one another to help create a better world, because you can't take it with you.","You can add five years to your lifespan by just making intelligent lifestyle choices.","The perfect date is real simple. I wanna just spend a nice casual day walking in the park, playing on the swings... throwing bread crumbs to the ducks, really just chilling and getting to know each other and connecting with the real woman.","I'm especially honored that The Black Gents will debut Off-Broadway and pay tribute to The Tuskegee Airmen and other ancestors of that time who have embodied excellence, self-determination, and self-discipline.","It's always a wonderful experience to keep working.","High blood pressure is a major health crisis in the black community.","I have a Masters and a technology degree already. When I'm not in film or television, my wheels are spinning full time.","I'm a proud Ellington alum. It has everything to do with who I am.","Just take one small victory at a time.","I still get lots of folks who remember my days on ATWT and AMC. As a matter of fact, they're the proudest fans of all because they feel like, 'We were here first,' before I had other fans from all my other shows and movies. They feel a deeper sense of pride and connection to me and have followed my career ever since 2002.","There's nothing more fun than just walking through town or maybe going to a community-based festival. How much does that cost? Nothing!","You can change your body shape by permitting yourself to exercise and eat a healthy diet and so on - and we've heard miraculous stories of people who have lost hundreds of pounds, and they look like a completely different person - but that's not the norm for the average person, and a lot of times, people don't get that way in a healthy way.","I played ball in college and semi-professional, and aside from the game and all that, the most valuable thing is the relationships. Who can care how many rings you have or how many championships you've won or how many records you broke. The most valuable stuff is the intangible stuff.","My mother and father were visionaries in Pittsburgh, part of that collective of people who were creative and active together, and I am a product of that community and those relationships.","I'm all about black folks working together and progressing together.","As an actor, you're not a person; you're a product, a commodity. It's about money. Your job is about making money for other people. At some point, you learn how to be on the other side of that table. You write, direct, produce, and create opportunity for yourself. Then you start to make money for yourself.","She's equally as gracious as someone who shares experiences with you as she is as a superior. What's so graceful about her is that no matter what, she's just Oprah.","Man, my days in Oakdale were a whirlwind.","I don't have a problem showing vulnerability.","We're human beings trying to love each other. There are constant revelations and room for growth.","People have no concept of boundaries.","Pittsburgh is home. I was born there, and it will always have priority in that respect.","Throughout my career, I wouldn't say my roles have been based on my being considered eye candy.","No one likes to be typecast, but I would like to believe that the attention I get is for my acting, but at the same time, darn it, if I get to keep playing the handsome, smart guy, then that's also a blessing, and it's the last thing I would complain about.","I play real men that I can identify with. I have a lot of guys tell me that they relate to me because I represent the real, everyday dudes.","Black people are not often considered mainstream.","My ability to bring different characters to life is what has helped me advance in my career, and I would say as far as looks are concerned, well, I suppose that would be the icing on the cake, but acting comes first and foremost.","I still play ball competitively because it helps keep me stay in shape.","This is America, and everybody has the right to voice and to have an opinion and to have their commentary on things and people.","It's great to go to work and your boss is a black man, one of your peers, you know?","I don't like a whole lot of flash and superficial stuff; I want a woman that's all-natural, in her purest form.","Everybody is important. Everybody has something to give.","A part of growing up in this international world is understanding and being prepared and having tools to adapt outside of the small environment that you may have come from. That's what education is all about.","I wanted to create a line for women and men alike that would encourage them to embrace the harmony and divine balance of sensuality and spirituality within all of us. Forplai is an opportunity to not only smell good and feel good, but to also take time to connect with the heavens above and the god in you.","There's no greater source of happiness than giving yourself to other people.","I've always been attracted to more than just the way a woman looks and the way she's shaped.","When you learn how to be really attentive, you learn the importance of patience and appreciating a woman. You're able to appreciate the softness of her skin and the look in her eyes. It's a connection.","I learned at a very young age how to be simplistic and sincere.","What I've learned is that what most women really want deep down inside is time to get to know you - and your undivided attention. They want it to be about them for a little while.","You need a spiritual foundation. Something that allows you to see how you connect to the rest of the universe. It's simple stuff, but it's hard.","'Why Did I Get Married?' did so well because it gave some real perspective on the realities of love.","Many women are so wounded that they can't love another person.","I need a woman who is secure and loves herself first. Then she can share that love and light with me.","Sometimes you can see a pilot, and then when the series starts, it's different people. That's always possible.","Most importantly, I realize the value of the other people - the extended family - the other people within my community, my cultures: my teachers and the other people I call Auntie, Uncle, Godfather, Godbrother, whatever. These are people who pulled you in and made you part of their lives and their homes.","Sometimes, people only change what they look like for the acceptance of other people, and that's where you start going wrong.","It's not attractive to be talking down about yourself all the time. All you continue to do to yourself is pull yourself further down into a deeper place of depression and sadness and insecurity and fear and hopelessness, so it's like, having God in your life is important, accepting who you are is important, regardless of what you look like.","Purity of the spirit is important. A lot of people don't focus on what's going on inside, and no matter what they look like, even sometimes when people do all this wonderful work or they are blessed naturally to look good on the outside, if their spirit is ugly - I don't care how fine you are, if you're ugly on the inside, then you're uglier."],"Lamont Dozier":["We wanted to guide the musicians, so we could create our own sound. We would never let the band just go in and play the chord sheets. We were very focused on what we had in mind for these productions.","Young writers should definitely research the current sounds and styles."],"Lamorne Morris":["If you have a lot of sweetness and quirkiness, someone's got to have a little bit of bite against that.","In TV, you're always confused because you legitimately don't know what you're doing the next week.","I think it's hilarious that you would give an endorsement deal to someone who you've heard their lyrics a million times and you thought it was cool. And then they said something a little messed up and you take the endorsement deal away.","I had this job at Hollywood Video, and during my worst audition ever, I forgot all of my lines in front of Chuck Lorre at the callback for the 'Mike and Molly' pilot.","I grew up in Chicago, IL. I've got three siblings.","I'm a big sports fan - mainly basketball.","I love being in public places, but I can't stand long, drawn-out music festivals.","I've known I wanted to do this ever since I was a little kid and I used to get in trouble at church for goofing off all the time: mocking the preacher, imitating people and the things they did. I later learned my mother used to be just as goofy as I was when she was younger. I mean, Eddie Murphy in 'Coming to America?' My hero.","If I wasn't acting, I'd be teaching acting. That would be my easiest thing to fall back on is teaching it."],"Lana Del Rey":["I have a personal ambition to live my life honestly and honor the true love that I've had and also the people I've had around me. I want to stay hopeful, even though I get scared about why we're even alive at all.","I believe nothing happens by mistake. You know, the universe has a divine plan. That sounds dramatic.","When I was young I felt really overwhelmed and confused by the desire not to end up in an office, doing something I didn't believe in.","There's backlash about everything I do.","I have a personal ambition to live my life honestly and honor the true love that I've had and also the people I've had around me.","When I walk outside, people have something to say about it.","I don't believe in the school of hard knocks, although I've had them. All that stuff about whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger is so not true. Do you know what makes you stronger? When people treat you and your art with dignity.","I don't really have any gimmicks. I don't actually do anything that's strange. I don't even wear weird things.","I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba - Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue.","When I found somebody who I fell in love with, it made me feel different than I felt the rest of the day. It was electrifying. That's what inspired the 'Off to the Races' melodies. That's one of the times when you're feeling electrified by someone else and they make you happy to be alive.","If you are born an artist, you have no choice but to fight to stay an artist.","My music is a luxury.","Seeing myself on the screen makes me cringe. I understand that I am that way - pouty.","People are really talkative in New York. Someone always comes up to me and says 'Hi' during the day.","Feeling like you're respected among the people who do the same thing you do is incredible and necessary.","Fashion is inspired by youth and nostalgia and draws inspiration from the best of the past.","I'm always just surprised when someone writes something about me.","I made that first record in 2008, alongside the EP, but my label at the time waited three years to release it. They thought maybe someone bigger would buy it, but they didn't, so in the end they just released it themselves.","I'm not a natural performer or exhibitionist. When I was younger, I hated the focus, and it made me feel strange.","If you consider the definition of authenticity, it's saying something and actually doing it. I write my own songs. I made my own videos. I pick my producers. Nothing goes out without my permission. It's all authentic.","When I put out 'Video Games' in May 2011, it was a 5:25-minute love song; I was surprised when a lot of people said they were listening to it. I was surprised when it went to the radio, without me even knowing how something like that even happens!","I used to wonder if it was God's plan that I should be alone for so much of my life. But I found peace. I found happiness within people and the world.","I'm personally more struck by visual things more than musical.","A lot of the time when I write about the person that I love, I feel like I'm writing about New York.","When I was very young I was sort of floored by the fact that my mother and my father and everyone I knew was going to die one day, and myself too. I had a sort of a philosophical crisis. I couldn't believe that we were mortal.","I have kind of a funny relationship with movies. I don't have to see the whole movie to get an impression of it or to let it have an influence on me.","I used to like to set different film clips to classical music, not even my own songs, but make little movies.","A lot of the reason my look is the way it is, is because it's really easy to put on a sundress every night if I have to perform - or just wear jeans every day and a flannel or something.","I don't know that much about who directs what movies, but I'm definitely inspired by the look of old movies; I find them to be really beautiful.","I knew I wanted to do something creative. I didn't think I'd have the luxury of doing something like that, because I didn't know anyone who had pursued anything they really adored, but I had dreams for singing or writing.","I've been reading tabloids since I was nine. I love a good story.","I love to sing and I really love to write, but in terms of being onstage, I'm not that comfortable, which I think is sort of clear.","Having a simple career as a musician who liked music was good enough for me.","I have taken taking my music to labels for years, and everyone just thought it was creepy. They thought the images with the music were weird and verging on psychotic.","I write my own songs. I made my own videos. I pick my producers. Nothing goes out without my permission. It's all authentic.","When I got to New York City when I was 18, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn - I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point - and that was it.","My dancing is Hawaiian-inspired but I also get a little fresh when it comes to my faster songs.","In New York I pretty much live in diners - I order French Fries, Diet Coke floats and lots of coffee.","I'm a writer first and a singer second.","I've been writing since I was really young, so I considered myself a writer for a really long time.","I didn't live at school, I lived where I could and studied what I enjoyed studying. I took what I wanted from that education but was making my first record at the same time. I don't know anyone from school. I was just leading a different life. I was really interested in writing and other things.","I was always singing but didn't plan on pursuing it seriously. When I got to New York City when I was 18, I started playing in clubs in Brooklyn - I have good friends and devoted fans on the underground scene, but we were playing for each other at that point - and that was it.","I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish with my friends from Cuba - 'Lana Del Rey' reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue.","I'm a writer first and a singer second. And then I started editing my own videos when I was 17, so it's a process I've been doing since I was younger.","I was impressed with what someone like Karl Lagerfeld built and did and the house that he made, but there was never really a female figure I wanted to emulate.","Stylistically, I love make-up. I love doing my own make-up and stuff, but clothes-wise, I actually didn't ever really care. Initially the fashion world was more interested in me than the music world, which was strange when I first started singing."],"Lana Parrilla":["I'm not one to take revenge. If someone does something wrong to me I leave it in the hands of the universe to take care of that person.","I am very, very diligent and extremely hard-working.","At 3 years old, I was imitating and doing fun little commercials for the family. Then at 5, I knew, 'OK, this is something I really like.' At 8, I was crying in front of the mirror and my mom was like, 'Oh boy, here we go. We know what she's going to do.'","To be vulnerable, to be raw, to virtually expose your guts, I like doing that.","I love horror, I love scary movies, I love thrillers. If things creep you out and spook you? I love it.","I actually study boxing - my dad was a Golden Gloves champion so I learned how to fight at a very young age. Growing up in Brooklyn you always had to watch your back, so I pretty much learned to protect myself.","On 'Swingtown,' I think that's when I was able to blend the character-slash-leading lady roles, and that's what I'm doing on 'Once Upon a Time' as well. She's a leading lady, but she's also this character.","I never liked apples. In fact, when I was a little girl, my mom wanted to give me apples in my lunch box and I would ask for green peppers. So bizarre... It's funny - I don't have an apple a day, but I can say that I have a few a week.","I like being scared, so I've always liked fairy tales because they're kind of creepy.","I used to be more of a sporty girl. I love outdoor activities. I haven't been doing much since living in Vancouver. I have my routines down in L.A.","Children, a lot of times, can't make their parents wrong because they have to live with them, because they have to love them. And when you're young, you can't get on your Big Wheel and go down to the Best Western. You've got to live there and you've got to figure it out.","I have a lot of LGBT friends and family members and I've always supported the community, not only as a child but as an adult, and I think it's important to voice that.","No real fairytale scared me, but Freddy Krueger did. 'Nightmare on Elm Street' scared the living hell out of me, but no fairytale. Maybe 'Hansel and Gretel' a little bit when they were walking through the forest and they met the witch. But I liked being scared, I really enjoy being scared.","I do watch 'Revenge,' 'American Horror Story' and 'Game of Thrones.' I am behind on all of them. But I do watch them. Those are my go-to shows.","I loved 'White Christmas' for the music aspect. I was into musical theater.","Every little girl wanted to be Natalie Wood, as did I.","When the script for 'Once' came my way, I had the thought that maybe it will last only a season. But I was willing to take that risk.","I played lots of fantasy games. I would create these worlds, and I would believe in them.","When I look back on my career, I go, 'This is really great, I've played so many different women.'"],"Lana Turner":["A gentleman is simply a patient wolf.","A successful man is one who makes more money than his wife can spend. A successful woman is one who can find such a man.","I would rather lose a good earring than be caught without make-up.","I'm so gullible. I'm so damn gullible. And I am so sick of me being gullible.","Humor has been the balm of my life, but it's been reserved for those close to me, not part of the public Lana.","I started off wanting one husband and seven children, but it ended up the other way around.","The most important tool of my trade was a mirror.","Since my life has been wayward and impulsive, always a search for something that is not there, and then disillusionment, I believe I need all the excuses I can make.","It's said in Hollywood that you should always forgive your enemies - because you never know when you'll have to work with them.","Whenever I do something, it seems so right. And turns out so wrong.","My life has been a series of emergencies.","Let's be honest, the physical attracts me first. Then if you get to know the man's mind and soul and heart, that's icing on the cake.","I have matured with the realization that I can live without a man!","Some day... some day, I want to go much deeper into the human mind.","The truth is, sex doesn't mean that much to me now.","I've always loved a challenge.","I'm always nervous when I start a new picture.","Cheryl's artistically inclined. She draws and sketches, but I don't know about acting.","When he would give you direction, it was not sitting in a chair saying, 'Hey, babe! Do this and that and the other thing.' Mr. Sirk would ask, 'May I speak with you?' and sit down and say, 'I think this should be done this way. And how do you feel about it? Do you feel it that way?'","Artie said it would be nice if we got married. I said it would be nice, too. The next thing I knew, we were on our way to Las Vegas.","I find men terribly exciting, and any girl who says she doesn't is an anemic old maid, a streetwalker, or a saint.","Oh, how I treasure this freedom. I really do It's a glorious, wonderful experience. I am off marriage - for life!","That Shaw is the most egotistical thing! He hogged the camera and spent more time with the hairdresser and the makeup man than any actor on the lot!","It used to be that when an actress reached thirty, she was considered almost washed up.","We started by playing girls who only married at the end of the picture. We didn't play wives. That came later. But the most dreadful thing was when a star had to play a mother. That was the beginning of her professional end."],"Lana Wachowski":["With a genre like film noir, everyone has these assumptions and expectations. And once all of those things are in place, that's when you can really start to twist it about and mess around with it.","My ideas are always better. We have an understanding in place.","We really want to see how the idea of an intellectual action movie is received by the world.","If audiences are sort of interested in movies that are made like McDonald's hamburgers, which do have a value in the world, then we have to re-evaluate our entire career.","I read The Odyssey all the time. I always get something out of it.","We tried to make a movie that had sex and violence because we like sex and violence.","With Bound, we wanted to pull at conventions, because you begin to wonder, Why do these stereotypes exist? Where do they come from? You use that as the subtext.","Billy Wilder is really is a heavy influence on Bound. We felt that film noir was a genre where you could create a really contained story. We wanted to be on a set as much as we could to get the kind of style level we were looking for.","Richard Donner is one of the few directors in Hollywood that can make whatever movie he wants exactly the way he wants it. No one will stop him.","I don't know why directors sign on to these projects and completely rewrite everything.","There's a science fiction project we really want to make, but it's very expensive. Hopefully it will happen.","We're both very very lazy, and having someone else do half the work is very convenient."],"Lana Wood":["I still have never met Harry Saltzman, and was told he is quite unpleasant.","I think I was only divorced once, and the rest were annulments. Or, maybe not. I can't keep track actually, because it's not that important. I just am who I am.","I went through my whole life wanting to feel I belonged. I was very, very lonely, so I would marry people that I wasn't really in love with, and who weren't right for me, because I hoped they would be.","No, I never ever considered myself attractive."],"Lance Armstrong":["If you worried about falling off the bike, you'd never get on.","Pain is temporary. It may last a minute, or an hour, or a day, or a year, but eventually it will subside and something else will take its place. If I quit, however, it lasts forever.","I exercise everyday. I swim, I bike, I run and I go to the gym.","There comes a point in every man's life when he has to say: 'Enough is enough.'","Two things scare me. The first is getting hurt. But that's not nearly as scary as the second, which is losing.","Pain is temporary. Quitting lasts forever.","The riskiest thing you can do is get greedy.","It can't be any simpler: the farewell is going to be on the Champs-Elysees.","But, listen, Eddie Merkyx would have won six Tours if he hadn't been punched.","I'm on JetBlue and United. So I spend a lot of time on airplanes with other people and in terminals or just traveling around and going to restaurants or whatever. The interaction I get on a daily basis is always positive. I've never had a negative interaction.","Winning is about heart, not just legs. It's got to be in the right place.","If we don't somehow stem the tide of childhood obesity, we're going to have a huge problem.","I figure the faster I pedal, the faster I can retire.","Extraordinary allegations require extraordinary evidence.","For whatever reason, maybe it's because of my story, but people associate Livestrong with exercise and physical fitness, health and lifestyle choices like that.","There's no rule, no law, no regulation that says you can't come back. So I have every right to come back.","Portland, Oregon won't build a mile of road without a mile of bike path. You can commute there, even with that weather, all the time.","If children have the ability to ignore all odds and percentages, then maybe we can all learn from them. When you think about it, what other choice is there but to hope? We have two options, medically and emotionally: give up, or Fight Like Hell.","It's nice to win. I'll never win again. I may have to take up golf - take on Tiger.","Marathons are hard because of the physical pain, the pounding on the muscles, joints, tendons.","Cycling is a sport of the open road and spectators are lining that road.","I have been dealing with claims that I cheated and had an unfair advantage in winning my seven Tours since 1999.","A boo is a lot louder than a cheer. If you have 10 people cheering and one person booing, all you hear is the booing.","It's tough to be a 15- or 16-year-old athlete competing around the country. There's tension, there's media. I had no idea what I was getting into.","I've committed to surfing the rest of my life.","I may be in timeout forever. But I hope not to be.","Through my illness I learned rejection. I was written off. That was the moment I thought, Okay, game on. No prisoners. Everybody's going down.","Obviously, I come from one background, and the people that design fitness equipment have been doing it for years and years, and they know what works and doesn't work.","If I can't face my accusers, that's a joke. We did that in medieval times.","Nobody needs to cry for me. I'm going to be great.","My mom was such a strong character. I don't want to say she was like a man, but she was tough.","I joined the swim team when I was 12, and I was the worst kid in the pool - I was put with a group of 7-year-olds.","I still don't get golf.","It's funny, because I have periods where I just kind of go dark. I don't tweet, I don't talk, I don't interview, and then I have times where I do."],"Lance Bass":["I think everyone dreams of that nice romantic wedding.","You've got to have a sense of humor to keep your sanity.","I find that once you start helping others, it makes you feel better about yourself. It helps you figure out what you want to do with your own life.","He's a couple sandwiches short of a picnic.","Unfortunately, if you don't want to be in the spotlight, get out of it.","I'm a family guy, so I would love to have a family; I would love to find that perfect person to have a family with.","I've always been interested in making movies.","I was always the Southern gentleman.","The beginning of the shows are different. One time we'll say 'Hello, Denver'. Another time we'll say 'Hello, Memphis'. It's always different.","I can't bear looking in the mirror - I guess that's why my hair looks like this.","I'm more liberated and happy than I've been my whole life. I'm just happy.","I'm at peace with my family, my friends, myself and God so there's really nothing else that I worry about.","I'm very religious.","We joke about it in the entertainment industry: Every actor wants to be a musician, and every musician wants to be an actor.","I'm more interested in producing than acting.","Somebody might get criticized for doing some movie that totally sucks, then turn around and be incredible. Every actor goes through that, not just musicians who act.","I've been asked too many times to write a book by the fans.","I definitely didn't want to be that person that came out and was like, 'O.K. I'm going to lead every parade.'","The gay community is very fickle. And I know because I'm part of it and I see it every day.","You know once you get in the business you know what you're getting into.","I've definitely, you know, been with women. And I've had great relationships with them where I was definitely in love. It's just I grew to a point where deep inside I knew that I could never truly have a relationship with a woman. I don't know if they ever suspected. It was never brought up.","Very few people have the guts to come up to you and say, 'Hey, are you gay?'","I just think with acting, there's not a time limit on it.","Speaking out is important for me because everyone should be treated equally.","I am fortunate enough with my career that I can speak out to the masses and hopefully be a part of initiating change.","It doesn't matter what color, sex, religion, age, sexual orientation, etc., everyone should have the same freedoms and liberties.","At some point in our lives there's something about every one of us that makes us feel like an outsider, I believe.","I actually didn't get to go to my prom. I left high school when I was 16 to join 'NSYNC. I felt that was something I always missed out on, and all my friends got to go and would tell me about it.","For once I want to have a relationship outside the public eye.","I want to toy around with producing a Broadway show.","I'm still Christian. I was not raised in a Christian church to hate people. I was taught to love people and accept people. I know what I believe.","There are so many kids out there that need to be adopted and need good homes. I definitely want to have my own but I also want to adopt for sure. I think it's very important to find these kids homes.","I'm used to people talking about me.","I'm a Southerner. We dream of having the family and the kids, and the parents want grandkids, that's all they care about, give me some grandbabies.","I don't want to have so many exes.","I'm a serial dater. When I see someone I like, we go on multiple dates.","In my older age, I've learned to take things slower, because I used to be that total-fall-in-love-after-a-day guy.","I'm a hopeless romantic.","I love cooking. It's one of my favorite things to do. To share my parents' recipes that I grew up with is just something very special to me.","It's nice not to have to live a double life.","I've always dreamed of having a large family.","When I go home, all I wanna do is just sleep and eat.","I'm the only gay person my parents know.","In Mississippi, you don't admit that you're gay. It's just an awkward thing down South, which is sad.","I'm such a relationship guy. I really am.","People do stupid things in the heat of the moment. I've been in Vegas where I've gotten married for, like, five minutes."],"Lance Burton":["It's new and different every night. The charge you get from a good audience is like nothing else.","I feel like I'm the luckiest person alive. I'm always waiting for that phone call: 'Hello. We've just realized you're really a no-talent hillbilly. We've made a horrible mistake and we'd like you to leave now.'","I always wanted to go to the Chavez school but I could never afford it when I was growing up so a lot of my learning came from magic books and watching other magicians. I was also very lucky that I had a couple of really good magic teachers.","When I started out back in Louisville, there was Harry Collins. He was my first teacher. He saw that I was so obsessed with magic that he taught me the love of magic.","Harry Collins was the first magician I ever saw back in 1965 when I was five years old. He was doing a magic show and I was the volunteer from the audience.","The dove act? I'm still working on it. I don't think it's perfect yet. I got my first pair of doves when I was 14 years old. That was the beginning of the formation of that act. So it's been 24 years now that I've been working on it.","We didn't have a whole lot of money when I was growing up either. I would always ask for magic books or magic tricks for my birthday or for Christmas and the rest of the year I either had to mow lawns or find part time jobs to help supplement the cost of doing magic.","That's sort of like asking a parent who their favorite child is. It's very hard to determine. Sometimes I'll get feedback from somebody who liked this part of the show. Others like another part of the show.","I'm very happy to be employed. I always contend that in show business that if you're employed, then you're successful.","I have no idea what's next. I simply don't have a clue.","I've worked nonstop for 31 years. I've counted down myself hundreds of cues for everything in each 90-minute show. I've never really taken an extended break, so I'd like to see what a vacation is really like.","It was a great opportunity that I had to take - my very own theater. That comes along once in a lifetime. It doesn't even seem like 15 years ago - time sure flies by. I've really had a lot of fun with it.","I'm comfortable and confident about the future."],"Lance Gross":["I'd rate myself an 8. I do have my flaws, but I'm a cool dude. If I wasn't myself, I'd kick it with me. I'm a down-to-earth person and all around cool guy.","It's an honor to be a part of Magic Shave as their new ambassador. One of the problems that some African-American men have with shaving is razor bumps. Magic Shave is perfect because once you eliminate the razor, you eliminate the bumps, and it's so easy to use.","I mean, I'm humble... to me, I'm just a regular cat from Oakland, California.","If I had my way, the woman I marry, she wouldn't be a part of Twitter and she wouldn't be on Facebook.","I would actually like to play Bobby Brown. To me, he was just the King of R&B at one point.","I really started dreaming... and broke out of my shyness when I got to Howard University. My first acting class was an Intro to Acting class with Professor Bay, who really broke me out of my shell, encouraged me to follow my dreams and make them a reality.","I got in a really bad accident in a Toyota vehicle, but I feel like the safety of the vehicle and God really saved my life.","It's shown and proved that hard work pays off. Make goals, achieve them and replace them with new goals.","I was actually picked on as a kid. I guess in high school it started to change for me. I guess being picked on made a lasting impression on me so I never - whenever somebody calls me handsome or anything like that, I never take it for granted. I appreciate it every time I hear it, so it's never something that gets old.","My parents always taught me never to take anything for granted because it can be taken away from you like that, especially when it comes to looks. I could get into a car crash tomorrow and disfigure my face. So I have to stay grounded.","For every person that doesn't like you, there's gonna be somebody who does.","I went to Howard University and majored in Film Production and minored in Acting. I turned down an opportunity to go pro in Track & Field to do this - I took a chance with this.","I met Tyler Perry and we did 'House of Payne' and a movie. We've done a couple other films since then, but it all boils down to the work. I'm a work-a-holic, which is why I think that I've been successful. If you tell me no, I'll work even harder!","I love everyone that supports me, and things can get wild at times, but my parents raised me to be grounded and to always remain humble. I think that's one of the main reasons that my fans support me.","It's rare that I turn down a photo or autograph, because these are the people that support me, so why not support them. I love it and I invite it. I love what I do and the whole 'celebrity' life and all that.","I had my father, and he was an amazing man and an amazing role model, so I always wanted to mirror that.","I definitely want children. That's important to me, so I just want to make sure that I'm completely prepared for it when that day comes.","I put on whatever is comfortable on me. Suit, jeans and tee as long as it's comfortable. It doesn't matter what brand. If it looks good I buy it.","Working with Tyler Perry has been a wonderful experience. Everything he touches turns to gold, it seems like.","Working with Angela Bassett is by far the best. I've watched and admired her for years. I'm very intrigued by her work. She's so cool. I still call her 'Mom' when I see her.","I just do what's comfortable for me, whether it's getting fresh haircuts, or the clothes that I wear. It's simple; I'm just me. I don't really go out of my way. I do make sure my face is washed and moisturized, though.","I love Twitter. As an entertainer, it's a way to connect with the fans, and I think that's important.","If you got a dope girl, there's going to be people that want her. But I don't know, I've always kept my 'A-game' on point. I just make a point to make sure the woman that I'm with is taken care of. You got to keep it new, so I go out of my way to make them feel special."],"Lance Henriksen":["But to this day - I'm very literate now, I love to read, I read constantly - words don't resonate the way they do to a person with a formal education. They're like a maze, a puzzle that has to be opened up.","You do your work as fully as you can, and the ones who hear the sound join in.","To me rites of passage through life, that's a wonderful, beautiful thing.","I appreciate the idea that anybody would think of me as a star. But I'm really not career oriented in the sense that I want to be a star. It's not in me. It's not what I do. In fact, I'm amazed that I've even gotten this far.","The thing I hate most in acting is asking permission to do things. What you really want to do is say, 'This is my need; this is what's going to get me further; this is what's going to be alive. I don't ever say, 'Do you mind if...?' I just come in and do it.","When I do a horror or a fantasy film it all boils down to something in the script that surprises me. It could be a big thing or a small moment. If it's there I'll do it.","Corporate nationalism to me is a little bit like what would have happened if Hitler had won. It's scary stuff. It's totalitarianism in a different from, under a different flavour.","You know something, if you're not acting, you're not an actor - you've gotta work. No way around it.","I don't think in words; I think in pictures, in images.","My feeling is, I do a lot of low-budget films. I don't do low-budget acting. I have no interest in just goofballing my way through, thinking, 'Ah, no one's ever going to see this anyway.'","What's frustrating to me is when, on a low-budget movie, people don't take chances. A big-budget movie, that script's your bible; nobody's going to risk going off the page. But when you're doing a very low-budget film, why not take some chances, intellectually, artistically?","If you're not acting, you're not an actor.","Growing up, I think I always had a sense of art: a sense that there was poetry in the world. I didn't know where I was going to find it. I didn't know where I was going to fit in, that was for sure. But I kept moving forward. There wasn't a future in anything other than movement.","Charles Bean is a brilliant director. I come in with an idea and try to do it, but I fall on my face. And then, he says, 'Wait a minute, there was a little moment in there. Let's try that moment and expand in that direction.'","Because I've done a lot of theater, I know what power is and how megalomaniacs are, since I've certainly played some.","I really like playing good guys, of course. Although, people make mistakes in their lives, and you could say that the mistakes make us who we are, by how we respond to them. I just don't want to play boring good guys, but I don't have that problem, anyway.","In the late 1960s, I ended up in Telluride, Colorado. It wasn't like the country club that it is now. It was very raw. Skiing was there, but snowboarders have now entirely overrun it.","As a kid, there was a painting of 'Appeal to the Great Spirit' that I would see when I would get oatmeal bowls out of the cupboard. This painting, it was so real to me that it frightened me.","In a way, being born is a sort of ecological contagion. When you have longevity of family, we remember our grandfathers and maybe our great-grandfathers. We somehow don't have the capacity in modern life to remember further than that. All of the ramifications of their lives have an effect on us, and we're not aware of it.","I'm a good guy. I love playing bad guys, but good guys that have a good thing going on, I like that, too. I don't like passive good guys.","I've always liked SyFy.","I liked 'Scream of the Banshee' because it was a real challenge. I thought, 'How am I going to pull off this character?' But, I also thought, 'Oh, man, I'm going to go for it.' He's got all the defects of character that an actor loves to play. So, I had a really great time.","One of my favorites of all time was with Jim Jarmusch, called 'Dead Man.' I was in that with Johnny Depp. I ride really well, and I shoot a gun really well. I love the genre. Once I did Westerns, I was hooked.","In every respect, fantasy is like doing abstract paintings.","I have never gauged myself against anyone else.","I always wanted to be an actor, even when I was a little kid. When I used to run away from home, I'd go to movies and sit all night watching Kirk Douglas. When I was 16, I tried getting into the Actors Studio, and they told me to get lost. I said 'I'll come back when I'm a man,' and I came back when I was 30.","You can't do every movie - although I do a lot of them - and the thing I'm longing to do is... it's not that I think I'm funny... but I long to do a situation comedy.","I've always known from the beginning of my acting career that you only get an acting job if you've got something to learn about it. If you don't do it well, you'll be condemned to doing the same role over and over and over again. If you do it mediocre, you'll have to do it again."],"Lance Ito":["The problem with not having a camera is that one must trust the analysis of a reporter who's telling you what occurred in the courtroom. You have to take into consideration the filtering effect of that person's own biases.","And if you take the cameras out of the courtroom, then you hide, I think, a certain measure of truth from the public, and I think that's very important for the American public to know.","Whereas if you have a camera in the courtroom, there's no filtering. What you see is what's there.","If you have a camera in the courtroom, there's no filtering. What you see is what's there.","I know the pundits and the news media have carried a lot of commentary about cameras in the courtroom, and there's a lot of controversy about it as a result of the Simpson case. But I have not had enough time to step back and enough time to evaluate that.","And the American public was able to make up their own mind whether this verdict was a just verdict or not. So I think there's a lot of value in the public being able to see how the system works or doesn't work, so I think there's a definite value there.","The American public got to see for themselves every day, all day, how this trial progressed. There's a lot of value in the public being able to see how the system works.","If you take the cameras out of the courtroom, then you hide a certain measure of truth from the public.","I have not fully had the opportunity to evaluate the impact of cameras in the courtroom."],"Lance Loud":["If there is a gay uniform, the differences are in how each man coordinates the details: the brand and cut of the jeans, the design of belts and boots, the haircut, the number and size of earrings.","Coming out involves varying degrees of difficulty that are affected by class, race, religion, and geography.","One result of An American Family was that I became a gay role model.","For the naysayers that claimed 'American Family' revealed us to be vacant, unloving, uncaring morons of the materialistic '70s, this image will be proven wrong when Mom and Dad remarry... Make no mistake. This is not to emphasize the sadness of my demise but rather emphasize the love of my family and friends.","Gay culture is in a coming-out process of its own. From out of the closets in the '60s, the culture moved onto the disco floors of the '70s and through the hospital wards of the '80s and onwards to the streets.","As anyone who is gay will confirm, being that way is not something you become, it is a set of emotional and physical responses that just are.","As I was coming out of the closet, our car was hurtling over an embankment.","David Bowie and Boy George created a safely contained theatrical expression of gay style.","I am now faced with mortality. Definitely not the most generous move.","I believed I was invincible.","I wore a woman's antique fur jacket to my high school junior prom.","It was a pleasure to be a gay eyesore.","My gayness became quietly accepted and, shock of all shocks, life went on.","My reasons for declaring a sexual preference had to do less with the pursuit of personal freedom than with the lust for pure shock value.","Proclaiming a sexual preference is something that straight men never really have to bother with.","Sexuality is a private matter; some believe that broadcasting it destroys the very things that make it sacred.","Coming out is a means of redefining oneself, of claiming membership in a lifestyle and a social order with distinct values. Chief among these values is honesty.","Gay culture is surviving and thriving. Some activists believe the recent rise in homophobic violence might be a gauge of the success of positive gay images.","I had been found in a mud puddle at 4:30 in the morning.","Perhaps there is no agony worse than the tedium I experienced waiting for Something to Happen.","When you've grown sick of reading and bug-eyed from watching TV, when your friends are all visited out, no words can adequately praise the link to the outside world provided by your parents and family.","Too pop for punk, too 'old school' for the New Wave, Mumps were a '70s era New York rock band, out of time.","In 1970, television ate my family. The Andy Warhol prophecy of 15 minutes of fame for any and everyone blew up on our doorstep.","I have a lot in common with Lewis Carroll's Alice (my favorite female literary heroine, besides Becky Sharp). I've been sent on a journey to places even bleach can't reach.","The bulk of my learning - if I may call it such - has come within the past three months, after I became a part of the fragile body of patients who make up an AIDS hospice. Here, surrounded by teams of supportive nurses, attentive doctors, and interns, one gently comes upon his own strengths and shortcomings.","I don't know if hep C is called 'the quiet killer,' but it easily could be, so unnoticeably does it nestle into your body before crankin' up the screws and letting you race to figure out what's going on.","Scrawling 'I'm gay' in lipstick on your parents' bedroom mirror may demonstrate a personal signature of the highest style, but is not particularly sensitive to their feelings. Upon hearing me utter those words almost twenty years ago, my own mother did what and self-respecting middle-class mom would do: went directly into a seizure.","In retrospect, the most unnerving aspect of being openly gay was that it turned out to be as disappointingly normal as being straight.","Unlike straight men, who have the luxury of being slobs because women usually expect them to be, gay men - whether preppies, fashion victims, or jocks - are thought to be more obsessed with how they look because they dress for themselves and, consequently, for each other."],"Lance Morrow":["Everywhere you hang your hat is home. Home is the bright cave under the hat.","As they marched, the crowds lining the route broke into applause, a sweet and deeply felt spontaneous pattering that was a sort of communal embrace. Welcome home.","A rattlesnake loose in the living room tends to end all discussion of animal rights.","Never forget the power of silence, that massively disconcerting pause which goes on and on and may at last induce an opponent to babble and backtrack nervously.","He vanished to the public in order to materialize for his family.","Vatican II was a force that seized the mind of the Roman Catholic Church and carried it across centuries from the 13th to the 20th.","The Church became both more accessible and less imposing. It threw itself open to risk.","The real 1960s began on the afternoon of November 22, 1963. It came to seem that Kennedy's murder opened some malign trap door in American culture, and the wild bats flapped out."],"Lance Reddick":["It's funny, because in drama school, my greatest strength was my range. So my early career was like that: I played all kinds of different characters.","Notes are tricky in an audition, because I find, more often than not, my instinct is right.","If you're going to come at me, come at me respectfully, and I will respond respectfully.","Growing up, I never imagined I would be an actor.","I grew up studying music. I went to conservatory.","You don't see a lot of black rock stars. The music industry tends to be segregated stylistically. It's hard for a black artist to cross over to rock music.","I started acting almost on a whim to help my music career.","'The Wire' really drew on a lot of real-life situations and real-life organizations - it created fiction to make a social statement about reality.","I'm an artist at heart.","When I went to drama school, I knew I was at least as talented as other students, but because I was a black man and I wasn't pretty, I knew I would have to work my butt off to be the best that I would be, and to be noticed.","Nothing will ever top 'The Wire.' It was historical. It was black cinema.","You either get better, or you don't progress.","The African American community is so under-served in the entertainment industry.","As I got further into my career, as a character of color, if I was going to have the types of opportunities I felt I deserved, and continue to have them, I was going to have to start creating those opportunities for myself.","I'm interested not just in projects that I'll be starring in, but producing film and TV that's really quality and great for adults; and when I say 'great for adults,' it doesn't mean without humor, because I'm also interested in doing comedy.","Don't be a victim; if you want to make movies, make movies.","Because of the way tech is changing, and becoming cheaper and user-friendly, it's becoming easier to make films cheaply, maintaining quality.","Art is art, and journalism is journalism.","I can only speak as an American, but most journalism here isn't doing its job any more. It's about selling stuff.","I mean, you know actors, we always want to do something else, something different.","'Pigeonholed' isn't the right word, because I feel like I've had a very wide range of characters that I've been allowed to play.","When you're in a high-stress situation, dynamics between people can change."],"Lance Secretan":["Authenticity is the alignment of head, mouth, heart, and feet - thinking, saying, feeling, and doing the same thing - consistently. This builds trust, and followers love leaders they can trust.","As leaders, we become whole when we see that our focused, singular commitment to making the numbers and the metrics cannot be effective on its own, but only when it is part of the whole picture - only when we see that it takes more than metrics to make up the whole.","Followers are the customers of the Higher Ground Leader, who strives to meet or exceed the outer and inner needs of followers.","Science sometimes falls short when trying to fathom the depths of our essence - and our inspiration comes from that essence."],"Landon Donovan":["I genuinely want to do my best every day, and I genuinely want to enjoy life every day.","I sure am handsome. I can't lie. This is one handsome guy.","You put a lot of pressure on your defenders to be able to hold the fort when you go forward.","I've never met anybody who says they don't like the World Cup. If you're a soccer fan or not, everybody loves watching it, and I think it could be the same for other sports.","It's got to be harder in real life to win a World Cup. But depending on if you play World Class level on FIFA, it's going to be difficult to win in the video game, too.","Life isn't perfect, of course, but we all know it's how you react to things that counts.","I want to be a positive influence. I want to be someone who they want to call in and want here consistently, regardless of my role.","As athletes, most of the time we deal with fans cussing at us, saying how much we suck.","Unfortunately, I think there's not enough education about hydration. When I was young, we knew nothing about it. We all know that there's cases of athletes having serious issues because of dehydration and even dying.","I've never asked a player if they would sign my shoe.","My guess is that if David Beckham wants Ronaldo's jersey, he's going to get it.","As athletes, we all have egos, we all think we can help, and when you're not given that chance, it's hard to watch.","I think where we're still a little bit behind some other countries is just our pure soccer knowledge and our savvy on the field. That takes time and generations that have watched soccer growing up, played the game growing up.","I got to say 'Hi' to Dolly Parton, which my mom thought was kind of cool.","I'm a little skeptical of foreign coaches in our league and in U.S. Soccer just because of how different our league is and our players are than other players around the world.","When you're with your club team, every week you have a performance to judge. But when you're with the national team, it's a little different because you might not play for three or four months at a time. Things change constantly.","I think all players reach a point in their career where it's natural to lose some of that hunger, that desire, to sort of break out or be a star.","That's a part that's always a challenge for athletes: trying to keep the passion alive while knowing it's still your job. There's no question that at some point, probably sooner rather than later, I'll be pretty burned out. And when that time comes, then I'll take a step back and take a look at it and see if I want to keep going.","I miss driving to Goodison Park. I miss just the positive energy of the fans walking into the stadium and how much they care about that club and the team. And I miss the players a lot.","I know conventional wisdom has always been to go to Europe, and I did that early on, and I tried it, but I realised pretty quickly if I wasn't playing, nothing else mattered - I wasn't going to be happy.","I've always thought it would be interesting to give insight on soccer because I have a lot of experience in my career.","A lot of times I watch sporting events, and there are things I want to say and things I see that don't get said or talked about.","I have to be able to be honest and be credible, and I think I can say, 'This guy did not have his best game today' rather than, 'He is awful and I cannot believe he did that.'","Skin cancer became personal to my family when my father was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma.","Men are sort of doofuses about sunscreen, and for the most part, women are more inclined to take better care of themselves, but a reminder is always good for everyone.","You got me: I do Pilates. I love Pilates because we do very specific training in soccer for the same six or seven muscles, but we neglect so many other muscles. So when I do Pilates, it helps get all the rest of the muscles in shape and gets them working together.","I like teff, an Ethiopian grain. It's not so popular in the States yet, but it's really good, almost like a porridge. And I love sushi, but it's not always that healthy, so I don't keep it at home.","There was this old soccer game called 'Goal' for the old Nintendo, and ever since then, I've played everything from the old school games to the 360.","I remember - when I was little, I remember playing 'Tecmo Bowl,' and I would be so excited to be Bo Jackson in the game that I wanted to watch him play in real life.","Fortunately, I don't spend too much time reading or worrying about what people have to say, but the goal for me throughout this whole process - throughout my whole life - is to try to be happy.","I think it's probably a good lesson for other people to follow - to not always make the decision that's popular for others, but to do what you feel like is the right thing to do.","I don't think in terms of legacy or that kind of stuff. I've always thought that'll take care of itself if I did everything right on a day-to-day basis.","I would probably say that being a commissioner in sports is one of the hardest jobs in the world.","When people say 'American soccer,' they think of the U.S. national team. But American soccer also includes Major League Soccer, and until we have a league that produces players at the rate other leagues around the world do, I don't believe we'll ever get to where we want to be.","Fortunately for me, it's my most favorite drill, and that is finishing. However, from a young age, soccer players in this country are not taught how to properly finish, and I think you see that through the professional ranks, that we don't have that killer instinct of the forwards from other countries.","If you've followed my career at all, you will know that I perform best in comfortable surroundings. Though other leagues may seem more enticing to other players, it's something I'm just not interested in doing personally.","As a spectator, you get to watch everything, but I'd much rather be playing than watching. I'll have time to watch later in my career.","I talk periodically with the producers at EA and I try to be as honest as possible because as great as EA does, you just don't want to hear good things. These people are really passionate about making games and making them as realistic as possible.","My brother and I have always had this theory that, as stupid as it sounds, in video games, there is a certain hand-eye coordination and a thought process that you can learn.","I grew up playing video games. And the cool thing about the EA Sports games is they took me through the whole motion-capture thing, where they put little sensors on my body so the video game really is me. It actually moves the way I move.","The biggest thing for me with charity is awareness. Obviously as an athlete, I have an opportunity to make people more aware. The average person doesn't have that opportunity, so the best way is to spare some money, clothing, food - something. Most of us have a little excess of something that we can give.","The advantage doesn't come because you can run more than someone over 90 minutes. The advantage comes when, in the tenth minute, I'm sprinting back and making another guy chase me. By the end of the game, that guy's worn down, but I can still keep going at the same pace.","There have been weeks when I've not been hydrating properly or not eating properly or training too hard. When I do that, I don't feel good. It has to be the exact formula.","I've always been active - outdoors, on the beach, playing - and so to go home and have to sit on my couch and relax... it's frustrating. Sometimes, you just have to really shut yourself down."],"Landon Liboiron":["The first thing I always look at on a girl is her eyes.","I would love to have a go at a band or some form of music one day.","I freakin' hate Twitter, man. I honestly don't understand the purpose of it.","I was never a person who dated in high school, because at 17, everything just felt like it had to be so rushed. Relationships just bounced around like crazy in high school! And now, I never want to rush anything. I just want to enjoy all of the steps.","My whole family is really close. I'm lucky for that.","TV is starting to become such a collective experience again. People are watching it on their own time, rather than being on a schedule. Netflix offers the easy opportunity to watch as much as you can.","I guess my favorite artists are The White Stripes or Tom Waits. The more theatrical the music is, the more I get into it. I also like the quieter folk music, that kind of old-school rockabilly or country. I'm not really picky when it comes to music, as long as it's honest."],"Lane Evans":["Without the brave efforts of all the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines and their families, this Nation, along with our allies around the world, would not stand so boldly, shine so brightly and live so freely.","World War II was a decisive time in our history and June 6, 1944, marked the decisive moment of the war.","A Harris poll I've seen says only 12 percent of the electorate names taxes as one of the most important issues facing the nation. Voters put tax cuts dead last, behind education, Social Security, health care, Medicare and poverty.","The Commission's findings underscore that the nation is still vulnerable to attack and that we must move more quickly to make us safer. We must take the Commission's work and use it to make certain that such horrific attacks never occur again.","Ethanol has reduced our nation's dependence on imported energy, created thousands of jobs, reduced air pollution, and increased energy security. And renewable fuels cost less at the pump. It is a growth fuel that fuels opportunities for millions of Americans."],"Lane Garrison":["To be a good actor you have to feel life and observe life.","In the end, crime doesn't pay.","I have much to say about the pain I've felt and seen inside of prison. It has been an eye-opening and harrowing experience.","One of the things about jail that's weird is that you're sent to a place where you're supposed to sit there and think about your actions and their consequences and why you're there. And I think now, it turns more into - the minute you go there, it's just survival.","If you speak to anyone who's ever done time, the fact that you make it out of there alive is a miracle.","I grew up learning from a father who said, 'When you make a mistake or you make a bad decision, you man up and take responsibility.'","I'm originally from Dallas, Texas, where Bonnie and Clyde were from, so when I was a little kid, my grandfather used to drive me past the Barrow Filling Station. At my elementary school, there was a barn outside that they used to say was a Bonnie and Clyde hangout.","Gene Hackman is one of the great American actors of all time.","Bonnie and Clyde were almost like a modern-day Robin Hood, stealing 'the government's money.' I think that's a bit of why they were glorified."],"Lane Kirkland":["Don't believe that winning is really everything. It's more important to stand for something. If you don't stand for something, what do you win?","We must be part of the general staff at the inception, rather than the ambulance drivers at the bitter end.","To hear the Japanese plead for free trade is like hearing the word love on the lips of a harlot.","The usefulness of a meeting rises with the square of the number of people present."],"Lanford Wilson":["But when I came back into the city for the first time last November, I thought every truck, every building was going to blow up. It has truly changed me something fierce.","I am one of the 11.5% of New Yorkers who remain traumatized by the events of September 11.","I am not sure why, but I have been obsessed by the Atom Bomb ever since it first happened."],"Langhorne Slim":["If someone asked what kind of music I play, I wouldn't say I'm a folk singer; however, if folk music means music for the people, and playing music to entertain them and share different messages, then sure, I'd like to think that I'm part folk singer.","I'm very proud of my records, but my most natural creative tendencies have been in live performing. There's a beautiful element to recording and making records, but I've always felt a little shy with it.","To be very honest, I never thought I would graduate from high school. I got very lucky to get into an alternative high school, which really saved my butt.","When I listen to most forms of music, in their most raw and pure, it all has a punk edge to me, like Lead Belly, Jimmie Rodgers, Otis Redding or Nirvana.","Before I had a record deal, I was living in New York and playing anywhere I could, from somebody's house to an open mic to coffeeshops.","Some people don't like my songs because they think they're too simple or easy or not that thought-out. I feel like the way I write is pretty simple, in some ways, because I'm trying to connect. I want a lot of people to hear it, and be moved in some way.","I love a lot of music that's considered folk music, but I also love a lot of music that's considered punk or considered rap. I don't mind being called a folk singer. But it seems a bit limiting. I want to be able to write whatever kind of song I want.","I guess I'm attracted to people who are singing about love or life, and they have a particular passion that I can connect with."],"Langston Hughes":["Like a welcome summer rain, humor may suddenly cleanse and cool the earth, the air and you.","Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken-winged bird that cannot fly.","Let the rain kiss you. Let the rain beat upon your head with silver liquid drops. Let the rain sing you a lullaby.","Perhaps the mission of an artist is to interpret beauty to people - the beauty within themselves.","Hold fast to dreams For when dreams go Life is a barren field Frozen with snow.","My soul has grown deep like the rivers.","Jazz, to me, is one of the inherent expressions of Negro life in America: the eternal tom-tom beating in the Negro soul - the tom-tom of revolt against weariness in a white world, a world of subway trains, and work, work, work; the tom-tom of joy and laughter, and pain swallowed in a smile.","We younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased, we are glad. If they are not, it doesn't matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly too.","I swear to the Lord, I still can't see, why Democracy means, everybody but me.","In all my life, I have never been free. I have never been able to do anything with freedom, except in the field of my writing.","I have discovered in life that there are ways of getting almost anywhere you want to go, if you really want to go.","One of the great needs of Negro children is to have books about themselves and their lives that can help them be proud.","Humor is laughing at what you haven't got when you ought to have it.","An artist must be free to choose what he does, certainly, but he must also never be afraid to do what he might choose.","When peoples care for you and cry for you, they can straighten out your soul.","I was a victim of a stereotype. There were only two of us Negro kids in the whole class, and our English teacher was always stressing the importance of rhythm in poetry. Well, everybody knows - except us - that all Negroes have rhythms, so they elected me class poet.","My personal experience has been that in my 25 years of writing, I have not been asked to do more than four or five commercial one-shot scripts. These were performed on major national hook-ups but produced for me no immediate additional jobs or requests. One script for BBC was done around the world with an all-star cast.","Writing is like travelling. It's wonderful to go somewhere, but you get tired of staying.","What happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up Like a raisin in the sun? Or does it explode?","I live in Harlem, New York City. I am unmarried. I like 'Tristan,' goat's milk, short novels, lyric poems, heat, simple folk, boats and bullfights; I dislike 'Aida,' parsnips, long novels, narrative poems, cold, pretentious folk, buses and bridges.","We Negro writers, just by being black, have been on the blacklist all our lives. Censorship for us begins at the color line.","To my mind, it is the duty of the younger Negro artist, if he accepts any duties at all from outsiders, to change through the force of his art that old whispering 'I want to be white,' hidden in the aspirations of his people, to 'Why should I want to be white? I am a Negro - and beautiful!'","I must never write when I do not want to write.","My writing has been largely concerned with the depicting of Negro life in America.","Beauty for some provides escape, who gain a happiness in eyeing the gorgeous buttocks of the ape or Autumn sunsets exquisitely dying.","I will not take 'but' for an answer.","Very early in life, it seemed to me that there was a relationship between the problems of the Negro people in America and the Jewish people in Russia, and that the Jewish people's problems were worse than ours.","It's such a Bore Being always Poor.","Certainly there is, for the American Negro artist who can escape the restrictions the more advanced among his own group would put upon him, a great field of unused material ready for his art.","Without going outside his race, and even among the better classes with their 'white' culture and conscious American manners, but still Negro enough to be different, there is sufficient matter to furnish a black artist with a lifetime of creative work.","Violent anger makes me physically ill.","The Jewish people and the Negro people both know the meaning of Nordic supremacy. We have both looked into the eyes of terror.","My chief literary influences have been Paul Laurence Dunbar, Carl Sandburg, and Walt Whitman. My favorite public figures include Jimmy Durante, Marlene Dietrich, Mary McLeod Bethune, Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Marian Anderson, and Henry Armstrong.","Even the 'Negro' shows like 'Amos and Andy' and 'Beulah' are written largely by white writers - the better to preserve the stereotypes, I imagine."],"Lao Tzu":["Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.","The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.","Silence is a source of great strength.","Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.","Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.","Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don't resist them - that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like.","Nothing is softer or more flexible than water, yet nothing can resist it.","When the best leader's work is done the people say, 'We did it ourselves.'","If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.","A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving.","The key to growth is the introduction of higher dimensions of consciousness into our awareness.","Life and death are one thread, the same line viewed from different sides.","Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.","I have just three things to teach: simplicity, patience, compassion. These three are your greatest treasures.","For the wise man looks into space and he knows there is no limited dimensions.","From caring comes courage.","A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.","Knowing others is wisdom, knowing yourself is Enlightenment.","Nature is not human hearted.","Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, have few desires.","Treat those who are good with goodness, and also treat those who are not good with goodness. Thus goodness is attained. Be honest to those who are honest, and be also honest to those who are not honest. Thus honesty is attained.","He who knows, does not speak. He who speaks, does not know.","When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be.","In dwelling, live close to the ground. In thinking, keep to the simple. In conflict, be fair and generous. In governing, don't try to control. In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present.","At the center of your being you have the answer; you know who you are and you know what you want.","Great acts are made up of small deeds.","An ant on the move does more than a dozing ox.","To see things in the seed, that is genius.","When you are content to be simply yourself and don't compare or compete, everybody will respect you.","Man's enemies are not demons, but human beings like himself.","Governing a great nation is like cooking a small fish - too much handling will spoil it.","Be content with what you have; rejoice in the way things are. When you realize there is nothing lacking, the whole world belongs to you.","He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough.","He who controls others may be powerful, but he who has mastered himself is mightier still.","When virtue is lost, benevolence appears, when benevolence is lost right conduct appears, when right conduct is lost, expedience appears. Expediency is the mere shadow of right and truth; it is the beginning of disorder.","Mastering others is strength. Mastering yourself is true power.","To the mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders.","Respond intelligently even to unintelligent treatment.","To lead people walk behind them.","Anticipate the difficult by managing the easy.","He who conquers others is strong; He who conquers himself is mighty.","Without stirring abroad, One can know the whole world; Without looking out of the window One can see the way of heaven. The further one goes The less one knows.","The softest things in the world overcome the hardest things in the world.","He who does not trust enough, Will not be trusted.","Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish. Do not overdo it.","Of all that is good, sublimity is supreme. Succeeding is the coming together of all that is beautiful. Furtherance is the agreement of all that is just. Perseverance is the foundation of all actions.","If you would take, you must first give, this is the beginning of intelligence.","Health is the greatest possession. Contentment is the greatest treasure. Confidence is the greatest friend. Non-being is the greatest joy.","He who is contented is rich.","One who is too insistent on his own views, finds few to agree with him.","To know yet to think that one does not know is best; Not to know yet to think that one knows will lead to difficulty.","Those who have knowledge, don't predict. Those who predict, don't have knowledge.","The words of truth are always paradoxical.","The wise man does not lay up his own treasures. The more he gives to others, the more he has for his own.","The power of intuitive understanding will protect you from harm until the end of your days.","One can not reflect in streaming water. Only those who know internal peace can give it to others.","The higher the sun ariseth, the less shadow doth he cast; even so the greater is the goodness, the less doth it covet praise; yet cannot avoid its rewards in honours.","From wonder into wonder existence opens.","There was something undifferentiated and yet complete, which existed before Heaven and Earth. Soundless and formless, it depends on nothing and does not change. It operates everywhere and is free from danger. It may be considered the mother of the universe. I do not know its name; I call it Tao.","The wicked leader is he who the people despise. The good leader is he who the people revere. The great leader is he who the people say, 'We did it ourselves.'","Fill your bowl to the brim and it will spill. Keep sharpening your knife and it will blunt.","The more laws and order are made prominent, the more thieves and robbers there will be.","If you realize that all things change, there is nothing you will try to hold on to. If you are not afraid of dying, there is nothing you cannot achieve.","To realize that you do not understand is a virtue; Not to realize that you do not understand is a defect.","All difficult things have their origin in that which is easy, and great things in that which is small.","Great indeed is the sublimity of the Creative, to which all beings owe their beginning and which permeates all heaven.","The sage does not hoard. The more he helps others, the more he benefits himself, The more he gives to others, the more he gets himself. The Way of Heaven does one good but never does one harm. The Way of the sage is to act but not to compete.","Heaven is long-enduring, and earth continues long. The reason why heaven and earth are able to endure and continue thus long is because they do not live of, or for, themselves.","The people are hungry: It is because those in authority eat up too much in taxes.","He who obtains has little. He who scatters has much.","It is better to do one's own duty, however defective it may be, than to follow the duty of another, however well one may perform it. He who does his duty as his own nature reveals it, never sins.","Sincere words are not fine; fine words are not sincere.","In the world there is nothing more submissive and weak than water. Yet for attacking that which is hard and strong nothing can surpass it.","If you keep feeling a point that has been sharpened, the point cannot long preserve its sharpness.","The snow goose need not bathe to make itself white.

Not a businessman. I like to create ventures in which creativity stands at the centre.","Real luxury is customization.","I try cars; I try them all. Cars need to be sexy, because we're not talking about biscuits here.","I've missed a lot of trains in my life, and another one always comes.","I don't have an MBA, and I didn't go to Yale. I'm not an academic person and wasn't a good student. Instead, I've been taught by some of the most inspiring people in the world.","Just because you're born in a privileged family and have money doesn't mean you're happy. Happiness you can't buy. Happiness is something you need to work for.","The value of 'Made in Italy' must necessarily be up-to-date. This is the philosophy that Italia Independent has embraced. We decided from the outset to do away with stereotypes and attune ourselves to the extreme pace, to the incessant metamorphoses of the globalized world.","If you stop for lunch elsewhere in the world, you tend to eat a sandwich, and a bad one. Italy is unique for the style of life. I think everyone envies it a bit.","I'm inspired every day by the great captains of industry and enlightened entrepreneurs like my great-great-grandfather and founder of Fiat, Giovanni Agnelli, who personally knew all his workers and gave so much to this country, or Adriano Olivetti, unique and innovative in every way.","The Cinquecento was an engine of motivation at Fiat. It refurbished the image of the entire company. It's a symbol for the company, but it's more than that. It's a global Italian symbol, as Mini is a global British symbol and the Beetle is a global German symbol.","My company Independent Ideas worked with Gucci on a special edition Fiat 500.","I'd say Juventus has a story as legendary as the Yankees.","Tiles, the best furniture, fabrics, bath fixtures, bronze - just leaf through any design magazine and you immediately understand they're all 'Made in Italy.' We have the premier opera house in the world, La Scala, and behind the Nobel given to CERN is the research of many Italians.","Even when it comes to zippers and buttons, Italy reigns supreme. The luxury market is ours, as demonstrated by the voracity with which various foreign conglomerates are buying up the jewels of our manufacturing sector.","I would say that Juventus is a myth not only in Italy, because it's the most loved team in Italy, but also around the world. And it has been in my family since birth.","I've lived in London, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, New York, and Turin. But New York is my favorite city. It has so much energy, so much toughness.","You can learn from everyone, the president or the cleaner. You need teachers in life, but they're not always school teachers or professors. You learn from ordinary people. You learn from travel, from just walking down the street.","Italy's assets are her style, her beauty, her creativity, her passion, her energy, her technology; and these will be core brand values of all our cars. Fiat as a company has a long way to go and a steep road ahead.","London is like a girlfriend I loved, then really fell out with.","London is the financial capital of Europe, a great platform to America and Asia. I love the fact that in British culture you can be whoever you want, and people don't even look at you. I don't feel that in Paris or Milan.","Tailor Made will help Ferrari's clients tailor their cars in a very personal, specific way. It's a bespoke service, like visiting Huntsman or Anderson & Sheppard or whoever your favourite Savile Row tailor is.","I like my country, but I don't think like an Italian. It's a complex, complicated difficult country to make things happen in.","I love Winston Churchill. I love the wisdom he had, the sagacity. I like people who are independent-minded. People who aren't part of clans or systems, who are talented and free, and able to do things without being corrupted by the system.","I am Jewish, Italian, American, Catholic.","I love Italy and I say I am from Italy wherever I go.","I am in love with cars; I love anything that moves.","I like listening to music and driving. How do you say... It's the only way I can 'chillax.'","I drive girls crazy because I might call them 20 times in one day and then the next day not once.","I've learned that if one is arrogant and if something bad happens to him, people won't want him to succeed. They will make more of an effort to bring him down.","Fashion is something which is non-lasting; it's ephemeral.","I am lucky because I can - and I like to - mix the beautiful Caraceni jackets I inherited from my grandfather with a pair of Tsubi jeans or wear a favorite pin-striped suit from him for more formal occasions. I'm crazy about pinstripes and vintage fifties fabrics.","I need to make things mine. It annoys me to buy something that is imposed on me. When I have a suit made, I go to the Sicilian tailor Alessandro Martorana in Turin. I like shorter jacket sleeves and often fold the cuffs up. It's more modern that way.","I have the Italian flag embroidered onto all my dress-shirt cuffs. I am very proud to be Italian.","A pocket square must always - always - be white and a bit wild. If it is too prepared, it is tacky.","'Made in Italy' is from the tycoons of the '80s, not me. It is people who represent an Italy which I don't belong to and I don't feel a part of.","I have many weaknesses, but I have one strength. When I do something, I do it 300 percent. I'm not a middle man.","I do not follow the rules of fashion, and I don't like to be considered a man of the world of fashion. I like to call it the 'style industry' because we try to work on taste.","I love challenges, and I believe that the challenge of quality cinema should not be underestimated as an important part of the Italian cultural offer.","My office in Milan is in an old factory. I have all my companies here, including Italia Independent and Independent Ideas.","I love Winston Churchill; I think he had the grace of coming and the grace of leaving - when things were hard he was there, and when it was time to leave, he left.","I have never let down Italy, and I never will. I love my country, and I owe a lot to my country, and in that sense, whatever I can and will be able to do for my country, I will do.","I am an obsessive personality. And if you are an obsessive personality, you need to be aware of it and be able to drive it with success. There are moments in your life when you are driving it well, but you shift and you shift badly and you hurt yourself.","In America, if you succeed, you don't have to apologize. In Italy, success is envied, and envy is the worst, worst, worst thing in the world. It's easy for me to say because I have had more than many others, but at the end of the day, I have never envied anyone. I wish to no one that they waste their time envying anyone else."],"Lapsley":["I'd rather go on stage and talk or do public speaking than sing. Singing is very scary. It's very exposing.","Sometimes before I go on stage, I think about how people can be so judgmental and forget they're the ones who bought your album; they're the ones that are singing along.","I think I might have played a song on piano or guitar in a school talent show. I went to an all girls school, so there were always little things going on, but it wasn't really until I was 17 that I did a proper performance. My first big one was Glastonbury, before I was signed.","I prefer to listen to a lot of male singers rather than females. Sometimes I find it a bit too shrill. I even find my own voice a bit too high.","My whole career will be about sad things. Happy songs about nightclubs and shots? That's not me.","Sometimes I worry I've said too much. But it's easier to write about things that are fresh in your mind.","Collaborating on lyrics has never worked for me.","I'm more than just the face at the front of a band.","The reason I can play loads of instruments is because I kept giving up and trying another one.","I'm a very creative person, but that side of me was suppressed because I was academic. I was depressed at school, and I didn't know why.","I don't feel like I have to prove a point and say that I love the kind of music that I make.","I think my songs serve a purpose in a very therapeutic way to do with relationships, very different to do with my opinions on world affairs.","I was a very closed person before, and I wouldn't say how I felt about things, and now I've kind of opened myself up. And it's scary.","So many people have gone to music production schools for years and years, and they've wanted this their whole entire life, and part of me feels like I've kind of cheated that a bit because I'm not grade A on piano, and I don't know a lot about production. But I do what I do.","I had piano lessons when I was five or six years old, so my mom got me this little keyboard in my room. And then it progressed from that to classical guitar and drums and oboe.","I never started learning instruments with the hope of having a career in it. It was more kind of I quite enjoy messing around and writing or playing with the family and stuff like that.","The first time I'd ever had a go at production or recording, I just recorded in my room. I just put it on Soundcloud because I have family abroad, and I wanted to show them, 'Oh, hi, Uncle Carl, here's some music that I've done,' or whatever.","My parents never told me, 'You're supposed to wear pink,' or 'You're meant to do this because you're a girl.'","I'm quite an independent person.","Maybe I'll want to go to Iceland and see the volcanoes, or attend some lectures, or go to Mexico and go to the jungle. On my own. With nothing whatsoever to do with music!"],"Lara Flynn Boyle":["Coffee and smoking are the last great addictions.","I love fast cars... and to go too fast in them.","I had so many freckles that my mother used to say that they were kisses from the angels. I still have them.","That's what the holidays are for - for one person to tell the stories and another to dispute them. Isn't that the Irish way?","Sometimes when you're just thrown into something, you are more ready for it than when you have time to think it over and get nervous about it.","I love talking about myself.","As soon as you get over caring what people think, you can have a nice time.","I spent every day just praying that I didn't look like a big dork on camera.","But Tommy Lee Jones is just smooth. He's just the real deal. I'm captivated by him because there's so little of that in Hollywood, and he just embodies it.","You know, the bigger you get and the more success you have, the more people you can fill your house with to tell you how great you are. You can do that.","You can get through your whole day only around people who will tell you that you're wonderful. But pretty soon they're going to have to be lying about that.","I know that I'm getting the real deal with my mom. I know that she's telling it like it is. She's proud of me when I've earned it and she's disappointed in me when I've earn that. She's really my spectrum on where I am as a person.","She comes from the Midwest. She had me at a very young age and raised me on her own. She's a very hard worker.","I love children and I love men, but I can't commit to either for the rest of my life.","I am a very selfish person.","I had such a great mom and I know that I'd never be that mom. I wouldn't want to bring a child into this world unless I could be.","I think the institution of marriage is a great idea, but for me it's just an idea.","And I don't believe that women can successfully have it all. I really don't.","I am very fortunate to have a career. I always have to act. I don't know if I'll have a career to support it for the rest of my life, but I know I'll always act.","And I think women have come a very, very long way, but they have a long way to go.","To put me through school my morn had to work, so I was a latchkey kid.","Being Irish was a big thing for me, particularly growing up in Chicago.","And while I might not always agree with the viewpoint I have to portray, because I play a district attorney, as an actress I can always tell myself that my character is trying to take the moral high ground.","I had never watched a law show prior to being cast on The Practice.","I've had Irish skin from the time I was a young girl.","I love receiving fan mail.","It is a great compliment to go out and be recognized. Although, because I basically go home and go to work, there isn't much opportunity for that kind of thing to happen.","Have I seen The Commitments? I was obsessed with that movie. I just watched it again about two weeks ago.","Men love it. They have a sense of humor, whereas a lot of women are threatened or just don't get it.","I still sweat bullets if I go on The Tonight Show, but I tell myself, You can either have fun tonight or you can be shy and miserable. You ask my friends or anyone I work with now - nobody would say I was shy.","I remember doing the sex scene in Red Rock West. I had to kiss Nic Cage and then look like I was going down on him. And he couldn't do anything - he just had to lie there.","Oh, I don't talk about Jack and me. Some things are too good to share.","Everybody wants to solve everybody's problems.","I don't have a problem with my body. I don't diet, and I'm not hiding anything. I'm not going to be the subject of a movie of the week 10 years from now.","I'm afraid of the dark, so I have a lot of night-lights.","But I know somebody who has a bedside urinal. How do I compete with that?","I've dated men my age, younger than me and older. The only difference is the young ones are quicker at taking out the garbage."],"Lara Giddings":["I am hopeful that one day I will meet that right man and will have a very happy life partner.","There will always be excuses, arguments, and questions of timing when moving on difficult and controversial issues.","I'm human. I'm a person. I would love to be in a relationship with a man. I would love to find the right man; I think that's natural - that's what we all want.","The role of Premier is not one that should be taken lightly, nor is it a personal trophy.","For some reason, men in politics seem to have a bunch of charisma, and women drop around their feet. I haven't noticed that so much for me and men.","I'm an ordinary Tasmanian like everybody else, and I have weight issues; I have issues around finding the time to do the exercise and things, but in my role as Health Minister, and in my role as myself as well, I have to look after my own health.","I am just as ordinary as anyone else, and I also have my problems, but I also am responsible for my own health. So I'll be on that exercise bike, I'll be out there walking and try to improve my health and diet as much as I'm expecting of other Tasmanians.","Being Premier is a 24/7 job, so it doesn't create many spaces in order to be able to build relationships.","The sad thing is that apparently if you want to become the next Premier or the leader, suddenly you've got to shut down your human side.","Tasmania needs a watchdog, not a lap dog.","Labor has a proud history of tackling discrimination and introducing important social reform.","At times I wonder whether or not your role as a member of Parliament... may in fact inhibit a relationship developing.","I don't have a steady relationship. That's something that women in politics deal with. For some reason, men in politics seem to have a larger charisma, and women drop around their feet. I haven't noticed that so much for me.","Death is not something any one of us want to dwell on, but we must all confront it at some point.","My first job as premier will be to go back to basics."],"Lara Jean Chorostecki":["I have a fear of things growing on things. I don't know where it came from. But I go hiking a lot, and sometimes I can't handle moss growing on trees or tumors on trees or mushrooms.","I have a passion for animals and spend a lot of my spare time working with various organizations here in Toronto."],"Lara Logan":["I'm high maintenance, but I'm worth it.","There's something called latent PTSD. It manifests itself in different ways. I want to be free of it, but I'm not.","I'm always gonna be crazy about dishes in the sink. Crazy! Because it's a sign of disrespect. It says that you think someone else is going to clean up after you: that you're not prepared to do it yourself.","If you care about injustice, and if you care about freedom, and you care about human rights, then you care about them everywhere.","Seeing death is not as difficult as you might think. What's harder is to see people suffer. It's the people the dead left behind that get to you.","After I was assaulted in Egypt, I learned fear. I've just never been so scared in my life. I've never been so close to death.","My children are my life. They're so spectacular.","Life is not about dwelling on the bad."],"Lara Pulver":["I'm a walker, whether that's a stroll on the beach at sunset or getting up at eight o'clock on a Sunday morning and doing an eight-hour hike through a canyon. It's Zen time for me.","I don't think it serves anyone to bottle emotions.","I'd love to have my own TV show, in the way that Julianna Margulies has 'The Good Wife,' or a lovely ensemble show, like 'Six Feet Under.'","I love my job, and I'm a lucky girl. I thoroughly enjoy going to work.","I want to do a big Broadway musical, at some point. I would love to do that. To do something there would be super-cool.","From a very young age, music was very much in my house. I would sit with my mom, with the old LPs, listening to The Beatles and Carly Simon and Lionel Richie. The old LPs used to have the lyrics. From there, I would put on dance and music displays for my family, just to entertain them and make people laugh and smile.","Martin Freeman is a genius, he really is. He gives you every color of the rainbow in every take and it's wonderful just to play off of him and opposite him.","I like playing off strong actors, whether it's Benedict Cumberbatch or Dominic Cooper. Also I'm a hopeless romantic, so I'm fascinated by relationships.","There's talk of the lack of roles for older women. It's so tough and it's soul-destroying what some female actors do to their faces to try and keep producers happy.","Initially after 'Sherlock,' I got offered a lot of swinger movies. There is that thing of keeping your mystique and not taking your clothes off in every job.","I remember being an usherette at my local theater very, very early on, selling ice cream and programs - because they're not free in the U.K. - during pantomime season, which was super interesting. It meant a lot of kids, a lot of sweets, a lot of sugar-induced kids.","I've always prided myself on working so hard and then achieving goals without realizing the pleasure is often in the journey. And actually, the journey can be just as fun, if not more so, than the outcome.","There's something rich and nourishing in the mundane - that isn't sparkly or red carpet.","I'm so bored of reading scripts with these wonderfully complex male roles, yet the woman character just sits on the bed waiting for him to come home.","What we say no to is sometimes more important than what we say yes to.","I've always been active: netball, hockey, rounders, athletics.","Having a family is really important. And there would be something missing in my life as a woman if I didn't at least attempt to fulfil that side of me. Just for a certain period of your life, to have your sole purpose to be nurturing, feeding and protecting someone else: it's animalistic, isn't it? It's beautiful.","I'm not an actress who's a fan of gratuity, so I don't seek projects that have nudity for nudity's sake. I don't know any actors who do, unless they're in 'Spartacus.'","I'd love to do a comedy. I always told myself that I don't have funny bones, and then I was working with Dervla Kirwan in 'Uncle Vanya,' and she was like, 'Lara, you're really, really funny.' And I realised I am, and that's not even me blowing my own trumpet.","When David Goyer comes to the small screen, what he's actually doing is making the small screen bigger.","Of course L.A. has its mad bits: you can get a collagen cappuccino if that's what you really want. But the American Dream is so ingrained in the American culture, and the place you go to find it is L.A.","Competitiveness only comes with insecurity.","Nature. That's the one thing that tips the balance in terms of living here in California. Within minutes, I can be in a desert, at the ocean, in a park, and that's the most nourishing food for my soul.","Fun and pleasure are just as delicious as achieving a goal.","I think I was raised by a very humble mother, who, if anything, is probably over skeptical. She has that sense of everything being a bonus: like, you have your lot, and anything else is on top. She's quietly proud, and quietly humble.","Sherlock' changed the perception of me. I have these cheekbones and this face that suggest very middle-class or period-drama roles. I want to show everyone there's much more to me than Irene Adler."],"Lara Spencer":["Finding your style is like putting puzzle pieces together.","'Antiques Roadshow' is my favorite show. Every Monday night I have one hour of appointment television. I get the popcorn out and tell my husband, 'Don't bother me.'","I love charity thrift stores. Amazing one-of-a-kind pieces at terrific prices, and all the money you spend goes to a good cause.","I absolutely love American folk art, can't get enough of it.","I love going to tag sales, to auctions.","I think the reason I love 'Antiques Roadshow' is that it is sort of like the lottery. There's the chance a regular Joe could walk in with anything and come out close to a millionaire. There's the thrill of the find.","If my daughter has a bad dream and wants to get into my bed, I'm a sucker for her sweet face and warm body next to mine, so I let her jump in. I should tell her to go to bed, but secretly I love it.","A mom has to be ready for anything.","Being on TV is similar to being an athlete. You get no second chances.","After college, I went into the NBC Page Program. It's one of those great programs that allows kids to get their feet wet in every area of the business.","I try to be athletic.","If I don't eat something after I work out, I get shaky and cranky - not a good combination when you're a television host.","I always recommend rewiring vintage lighting. It's not a bargain if your house burns down.","It's not a bargain if it has bedbugs."],"Lara St. John":["Our dad was a great guy and we will never forget him.","What is classical music if not the epitome of sensuality, passion, and understated erotica that popular music, even with all of its energy and life, cannot even begin to touch?","Let me be very honest and just say that if any airline would let me take the violin and the laptop on board I would fly that airline all the time.","For many years, the government of Canada has massively supported orchestras and the arts in general.","Ergo, because of the money problem, it is probable that our orchestras will soon go down in quality.","Mostly this problem is contained in the fact that the US makes it so difficult for Canadians to get green cards (you heard it here), but if an American orchestra really wants a player, they have their ways.","There are no benefactors in Canada because there is no incentive.","I am very lucky and grateful to have this living link to a past era, the violin presumably having much more history to it than the later portion that I know.","I thought that maybe it is not so much, as he seems to think, that the world loses interest in female performers after they hit a certain age, than the performers lose interest in the world.","Although I do not have a family, I have eyes, ears and imagination, and know, as most people know, that the importance of one's children is paramount.","Raising a small child as a woman while travelling 10 months out of the year would, I believe, be something I would not be able or even want to do, although with the amazing example of Leila, I am no longer so sure.","A good example of how it must have been is today's world of conducting, which is still utterly dominated by men, and the prejudice the few female conductors have to battle even today is astounding.","I see no reason to hide who I am or what I look like.","Music is art, art is life, and we are who we are, and all of these aforementioned women, unless they should choose not to, will be performing well into the next many decades because they are great artists.","I had been playing since I was 2 years old, never remembering a life without music, always playing everything naturally and mostly by ear, and all the grownups wanted were more scales and drudgery out of me.","The concept is basically; that the pieces we know and love are made up of scales, arpeggios, and the like.","Another thing: despite my youthful appearance, I am quite capable of making decisions.","Historically, the notes of scale systems anywhere have been based on these pure harmonics.","There is no earthly reason why a solo string instrument or voice, having the possibility to play or sing pure intonation, should want, or try, to be tempered.","Normally, the same strange impulse which brings a crowd to an accident is present in the reaction to a concert in which something goes wrong.","When you arrive at your destination, pay absolutely no attention to the thing people call jetlag.","However, the thought hit me that this was a pretty pathetic way to kick the bucket - being accidentally poisoned during a photo shoot, of all things - and I started weeping at the idiocy of it all.","Naturally, I was a bit of a curiosity, being the first hydrogen peroxide ingestion patient they had ever seen.","And apparently things like a Vindaloo curry are out for the rest of my life, or at least a long time."],"Lara Stone":["I think of dieting, then I eat pizza.","My mother tells me of when I was 10 or 11 and I'd wear really tight, short skirts and crop tops. All the local men would wolf whistle and stop and stare, but I didn't realise why at the time.","Being sexy is something inside, and not everybody has it.","I like spending time with my husband.","I'm happy people look at me as a role model.","It's quite nice to have a bit more color on the lips during wintertime. And it's festive, isn't it?","I'm terrified of having a little girl. Girls are more evil than boys.","Every time I go to the dentist they say, 'You really need to fix that gap of yours'. I'm like, 'My gap is paying your dentist bills.'","When planning your wedding you make so many decisions: 'Do I want this fork or that fork?' But in the end people aren't going to remember what napkin holder you choose.","I'm terrible in high heels. I'm so bad.","I never gave it that much thought to pursue acting or anything, but I would definitely be a Bond girl if they asked me. For sure - I would make a great evil Bond girl!","I started modeling when I was 13 or 14, I think.","I mean, sometimes when you do a show or a campaign with a designer, you get along with them really well and you become friends. And then, sometimes, people are just a bit... weird.","Like most women, I have days where I feel like today I'm not leaving the house - you know days where you've got a spot on your nose or when you've just got off a flight, eaten fish and chips and feel really bloated - that one happens a lot to me.","I don't even sing in the shower.","Marriage takes work - it doesn't just happen.","In school I was always the funny-looking, tall, skinny kid that got made fun of because of my weird teeth.","It's not like I'm sitting at home coming up with some secret beauty plan.","I try to eat fruit and be healthy.","I love to get a massage but I'm quite a baby with it. I don't like them too hard or anyone walking on me or anything. When it's good, it's the best thing ever. When it's bad, it's an hour of absolute agony.","I work out sort of moderately.","I can have an androgynous quality.","Going to rehab was the best decision I ever made.","I used to come up with these crazy jobs to try and provoke my parents but they said, 'You can be anything you want.' So I was like, 'I want to be a garbage man' and they were like 'That's OK, we'll still love you!'","I think men look best when they're dressed in something that makes them feel comfortable.","What should all men know about women? That we are always right and you should just agree.","Interviews make me so nervous - I can't get a sentence out of my mouth.","I would love to have children some day. I'd like little gay boys. That would be good.","If I could have the discipline to be super-skinny, I would be.","I'm a woman, and every woman wants to be skinnier - unfortunately.","When it's colder, your skin needs more attention.","My mom didn't use face cream, like, nothing at all. She's got great skin and looks very youthful.","I think people like it when you have a bit of personality.","I always like to sing along to some depressing, angry Morrissey.","If I had to model clothes in a time period other than the 21st century, I think I'd like to model way back when they just wore skin loincloths. That would be best suited for me - better than corsets. I'm quite claustrophobic.","When I'm 80 years old, I don't know what I want to be remembered for.","I love men's wear."],"Laraine Day":["Metro never really wanted me for anything. I was always the one who happened to be free when their first choice was not.","My life as Mrs. Leo Durocher and baseball come first.","I think that Richard Nixon is a great man and that he is very dedicated to what he does. I had the pleasure of meeting him when I attended the Republican National Convention in Miami. You can really tell that he is willing to go out of his way to help the American people.","I'd rather win a pennant than an Academy Award.","I am very much a Republican.","I enjoyed working at R.K.O. more than at M.G.M. At R.K.O., the parts were better!","M.G.M. never really gave me a break. They loaned me out for leading roles but cast me in programme pictures.","Let someone else be the world's greatest actress. I'll be the world's greatest baseball fan.","Baseball is not a lot of statistics to me. It's blood and tears."],"Larenz Tate":["As an actor, you always want to find a piece of who you are in every role you take on.","It's actually kind of cool that women have taken to me. Because now I have a whole different demographic when it comes to the audiences. I have women who come out and support my movies, and that is a huge demographic for me, which is great because some actors don't have a female base at all.","Just watching TV as a kid, for a long time I thought, as a young kid, obviously when I was, like, 4 or 5, I thought that people lived in the television.","'Scarface,' I remember going to see that with my father. We didn't know what to expect; we did not know what to expect. I was a kid, and my father took me, and we didn't leave. It was so disturbing, but we loved it.","How did I go from 'Menace II Society' to 'Love Jones?' There wasn't a poetic moment or romantic bone in O-Dog's body.","Fortunately, I grew up in a family that was grounded. My mother and father knew how to guide my career and look out for my best interests.","I like the action business. I like the action movies. I guess Hollywood wants to see me do action. So I am down. I like it.","What I look for in a script is the plot point and whether they're strong, obviously, or not, whether the characters are rich or not, and if I can do justice to the character or not. Some movies you look at and the script is so bad that no one can do anything with the script.","I'm looking to produce more stuff: TV shows, commercials, music videos and short films. I'm building my catalog so I can have some fun in between the times that I get to a movie.","I approach film no differently than I approach a role. I want to make sure the movie is right, the characters are right, I can really bring something to it as a visionary, a storyteller. It's great to point a camera, but can you tell a story?","'Menace II Society' itself was a groundbreaking film. It's definitely going to go in the vaults of classics in all of cinema. The Hughes Brothers created an incredible project. Just gave the world something a little different than what we had seen in previous films in that same genre.","When I was younger, I didn't have the finer things in life. It was around me - the cars, the jewelry and all of that. But I didn't have it. So I did bad things to get what I wanted. Going to jail never crossed my mind. I wish it had. When I was locked up, my mother didn't support me because she couldn't accept who I was and where I was.","'Crash' is a movie about the racial tension that still exists in America. A lot of us pretend that we don't have preconceived notions and stereotypical ideals about each other, but we do. And we wanted to create a movie about people whose lives crash into each others' accidentally."],"Larisa Oleynik":["Everyone tries to talk you out of going to college. The consensus being that people are just gonna forget about you, you know, and that's the way the business works.","I've had a pretty charmed life, so there's nothing that I need to take too seriously right now.","If my mom reads that I'm grammatically incorrect I'll have hell to pay.","I don't know that I have any role models now that are fixed. Definitely my mom - she's the coolest. She's worked really hard her whole life and I just think she's got a great attitude. Moms just know so much it's so silly.","College inspired me to think differently. It's like no other time in your life.","I'm a normal person and I don't have superpowers! I do normal things, too.","If I had to choose, I'd choose my friends over my career.","I love my job so much, and not everyone can say that and I recognize how lucky that is.","I hate Valentine's day. It is a day for nothing but disappointment."],"Lark Voorhies":["My mother saw a movie when she was 14 years old. I forget the name of the movie, but one of the lead characters was named Lark. She decided then she would name me and she stuck to it, and here I am.","Clearly I am a very strong, top-of-the-line, always-rising-to-it personage.","We did get to keep a few choice items. I kept a few pairs of slacks and power suits that stood out. I still have a few outstanding pieces from 'Saved by the Bell' simply because they were from 'Saved by the Bell.' They're vaulted in my storage space.","I thrive with fashion and shopping and imports and things like that. It gives me a rush.

It's being able to take it as well as dish it out. That's the only way you're going to get respect from the players.","I wasn't real quick, and I wasn't real strong. Some guys will just take off and it's like, whoa. So I beat them with my mind and my fundamentals.","Push yourself again and again. Don't give an inch until the final buzzer sounds.","The one thing that always bothered me when I played in the NBA was I really got irritated when they put a white guy on me.","Leadership is getting players to believe in you. If you tell a teammate you're ready to play as tough as you're able to, you'd better go out there and do it. Players will see right through a phony. And they can tell when you're not giving it all you've got.","It doesn't matter who scores the points, it's who can get the ball to the scorer.","The best players will play. That's the way it will always be.","When it gets down to it, basketball is basketball.","I don't know if I practiced more than anybody, but I sure practiced enough. I still wonder if somebody - somewhere - was practicing more than me.","I like being by myself.","While day by day the overzealous student stores up facts for future use, he who has learned to trust nature finds need for ever fewer external directions. He will discard formula after formula, until he reaches the conclusion: Let nature take its course.","As far as playing, I didn't care who guarded me - red, yellow, black. I just didn't want a white guy guarding me, because it's disrespect to my game.","If there was a payment to the bank due, and we needed shoes, she'd get the shoes, and then deal with them guys at the bank. I don't mean she wouldn't pay the bank, but the children always came first.","When I was a kid, I never thought about anything. Never had to think about where I was going to school or what I was going to do. I just lived minute to minute.","What's better? Dogs or broomsticks? I mean will the world really ever know?","I really don't like talking about money. All I can say is that the Good Lord must have wanted me to have it.","I mean, the greatest athletes in the world are African-American.","But it is a black man's game, and it will be forever.","I get homesick.","When I was a kid, like 14 or 15, I played with the waiters from the hotel, 'cause that was the best game. And these guys, they'd let me play. And they were black guys.","Once you are labeled 'the best' you want to stay up there, and you can't do it by loafing around.","The best player I ever played with was Dennis Johnson.","I've been around a while. I kinda know these things.","It's been a journey, the NBA. It's taken me a lot farther than I ever expected.","I used to love the feeling of running, of running too far. It made my skin tingle.","I'm a loner."],"Larry Bishop":["I dug the idea that I was being perceived as the black sheep of my family, but for me, it was like, I was a rebel, and that to me was most important.","I always see that there's a - from a philosophical point of view - there's the appearance of things that everybody wants you to think is happening, then there's the reality underneath it.","My biggest influences as an actor were Marlon Brando, and I really dug James Dean.","The first bike that I bought was a Triumph 650. I really like the Triumph 650. I mean, of course, I've driven Harleys, and I think in 'Savage Seven' I drove an Indian, but - I really love Triumph.","With all due respect to the people who made the motorcycle movies during the '60s, I felt the sophistication level could be a bit higher, and I felt I could raise the bar on that, too.","I've met a lot of people since I was around four years old, some really big ones along the way, and I don't think I've met anyone who's as generous of spirit as Quentin Tarantino.","I went to Phoenix, Arizona for 'Angel Unchained,' and they'd hire the bike gang from Phoenix to be extras in the movie.","I got it into my head that I was going to be starring in movies that I wrote, so that's what I did. I stopped acting in all things, and I wrote my first script, which was optioned a week after I finished it."],"Larry Brilliant":["Global warming is something that happens to all of us, all at once.","Smallpox was the worst disease in history. It killed more people than all the wars in history.","A 501(c)3 can't lobby. A 501(c)3 can't invest in a company or build an industry. It may be that the only way to deal with climate change is to create an industry or build companies.","Many of the issues we face in dealing with rapid climate change are well suited to an engineering mind.","If I have a 100 percent batting average, you should fire me, because it means we haven't tried anything really noble.","I had been a radical, a left-wing politico, and meeting the Indian people made me realize that the politics of the left and the right were so much less important than the politics of the heart and the spirit.","The great thing about gurus is not that they make you feel everybody's love. It's that they make you feel that you can love everybody.","The point of life is to transcend the smallness of the finite self by identifying with things that last.","If you are constantly making judgments based on superficial affiliations, your world gets to be pretty small."],"Larry Brown":["I want to do anything where people feel I can help make their franchise better and make a contribution.","You always care about your teammates, and you care about the game.","When you're bad in the NBA, you're in the lottery. When you're great in college, you get multiple lottery picks.","When I was 26, I got offered the Connecticut job, but the ABA started, and I thought I could still play.","The bottom line is, I want us to rebound, defend, share the ball, play hard. That's all. Now if you can't do that, if that's not important enough to you, it's not on me.","Leading the SMU men's basketball program is an honor and a responsibility that I take very seriously.","College kids want to be coached. They want to be taught. They might resist it a little bit early on, but the more you give, the more you get back.","I struggled in school. Math and science were difficult for me. But I can watch 10 guys play, and I can tell you what everybody did. It might be a curse because when you see everything, sometimes you don't let your kids play.","My whole thing is being a coach, a GM, and a president: you all got to be attached at the hip. There's got to be no separation between you. The players got to know it's one voice: we're all in this together; we're going to do this right.","I can't figure out how you can hire a coach and tell him how you want him to play.","I can't figure out how you can draft players for a coach that you know coaches a certain a style, and was successful doing that style, and get him to play a style that you feel comfortable with.","If you see the NBA now, a lot of it is in transition. Most people now try to get an easy shot off in six or eight seconds before the defense gets set.","I think it's an unbelievable responsibility to our sport, coaching in New York, because the fans are probably the most knowledgeable, or as knowledgeable as any team in the League.","I've grown up playing for some incredible coaches, and I don't think anybody's ever been as fortunate as I have in terms of the people I've been allowed to play under, coach under, or be involved with.","You've got to try to guard, make an effort to defend to the best of your ability. You have to rebound the ball, which was an area that was so critical. And they wanted you to play smart and have fun. I've kind of tried to let our people understand those are the most important things that I could possibly tell them.","I almost took a job in Italy. It was really a great opportunity, but they didn't think I had enough international experience.","I want to teach. I've got to figure a way to continue doing this in some capacity.","I don't think there's any difference in my passion than when I was a young coach. I hope somebody in some way realizes I could be an asset, but we'll just wait and see.","I want every kid to go to college and be like a normal student. I want them to be able to go to a movie, go to a concert. I want them to be able to have that opportunity. But if you're paying kids, are you going to pay a lineman less than you're paying a quarterback? I don't know how to explain that stuff.","I think, with every kid I coach, I'm trying to get them to do the right thing all the time. I always feel like you should raise the bar. There needs to be expectations.","You look at the NBA: there's all these young kids that are drafted on potential. They go to bad teams, they're in bad locker rooms, and now we got this analytics stuff that doesn't teach kids how to play. We've got these workout coaches that don't teach kids how to play basketball.","I would hope the NBA Players Association would say that people like LeBron could come out early because he's so gifted, but if you stay, you stay three years. Your skill level will be greater, and the chances of you going to the NBA are much greater.","I can't walk in an airport, walk into a gym, where the kids in the gym don't come to me and ask me about Allen and tell me he's their favorite player of all time. And everywhere I go in airports, people look at me, and they, 'You're Allen's coach.'","I don't know why you play a team sport and not be concerned about making your teammates better and helping your team win games. That's the only thing that really matters, and if you're the best player, surely you're going to have some effect on the game's outcome.","I've been coaching how many years? A long time.","I never left a team in worse shape than I got it. Not once.","Look at how many North Carolina kids have played for me or tried out for me or coached with me. I've had Dennis Wuycik, Steve Previs, Billy Chamberlain, Donald Washington, Darrell Elston, Tommy LaGarde, Bobby Jones. You name it, I've had them. Whatever Coach has ever asked me to do, I've done. Because I love the school, and I worship him.","One place had a winning record that I went to, and that was Detroit. Rick Carlisle laid a foundation that gave us a chance to win a championship.","Why would you want to do something and not be special and want the best?","Everyone wants to psychoanalyze me. I don't know why.","I want to coach because I love it. I don't want to sound hokey, but when you play for Frank McGuire, Dean Smith, and Pete Newell - they taught me a lot - I want to share what they taught me with a lot of people. I don't want to stop doing this.","As long as I feel like I'm helping kids get better, I don't see why I should stop.","I'd rather be involved and somebody say, 'Hey, coach, here's what I need you to do. Go down to the D-League and work with guys'... I want the D-League coach to learn how to be a head coach.","I want to be like Johnny Bach or Pete Carril or Tex."],"Larry Buchanan":["I was doing acting work at Fox - bit pieces with Greg Peck in The Gunfighter and things like that - and grew up more or less as a Fox contract player in about two years.","I wanted to be a director and producer and writer, but in the early '40's the union wouldn't let you get through the gates. You couldn't get on a crew, or even learn to direct."],"Larry Bucshon":["I don't believe that employers should have access to an employee's private passwords, including Facebook.","Here in Indiana and in many states throughout the union, we rely on coal to power our homes and provide good-paying middle class jobs - like the one my family relied on when I was a kid. The coal mine helped put food on our table and helped me pursue an education and realize the American Dream.","I was a heart surgeon before I came to Congress, and I've worked many holidays on behalf of my patients."],"Larry Burns":["Fuel cells create a better automobile that's 50 percent more energy-efficient overall and sustainable from energy and safety perspectives.","I don't believe that a hydrogen economy depends on a carbon economy at all."],"Larry Charles":["I take big risks, but I'm not reckless about it.","You can repeat things because it's on a set and there are actors. But if it's a great moment and you don't capture it, it's rare to get that moment again.","I don't want to just add another DVD to the pile. So I think, 'Is this going to have an impact and some lasting value? Is it worth it for me to spend two years of my middle-aged life on this?' They're my criteria, and I think that's led me to more urgent projects.","I grew up in Brooklyn, New York. I grew up in a very Jewish neighbourhood and thought the whole world was like that. My parents were secular, but I went to a very Orthodox Jewish school, and I really got into it. I found it all fascinating, and I was just kind of really attracted to the metaphysical questions."],"Larry Cohen":["Most of my films have a lot of character development and exploration, whereas in most horror movies the characters are just cardboard.","Are you eating it? Or is it eating you?","All my films have some kind of statement about something - but I have to coat it with entertainment to make it palatable. Otherwise it becomes a polemic, and people don't want to see it. If you're trying to get a message out to people, you've got to entertain them at the same time.","The ending is really the most important part of the movie. If the first hour and 20 minutes is terrific and the last ten minutes stinks, everybody walks out of the theatre and says: 'That was a lousy movie!'","Movies, particularly the big hit movies, are all just special effects. But on television, the writers are in control of the shows, and they control the scripts."],"Larry Craig":["Flag desecration is not a constitutional issue for the courts. It is a political one that belongs to the people.","We do not take away the powers of surveillance. We do not take away the right and the power of the government to go after those who would do us wrong.","Congress has a responsibility to make sure our taxpayer dollars are being spent responsibly and effectively, and at the same time, that our men and women in uniform have everything they need to carry out the War on Terror.","Laws protecting the United States flag do not cut away at the freedom of speech guaranteed in the First Amendment... Congress made this position clear upon passage of the Flag Protection Act of 1989, which prohibited desecration of the flag.","We came to Iraq to liberate them and to make our world a safer place.","Breast cancer deaths in America have been declining for more than a decade. Much of that success is due to early detection and better treatments for women. I strongly encourage women to get a mammogram.","I'm for anything that lets people come here to work legally. There are more protections for workers who are here legally than for those who are not. It's also safer for the workers and employers have a more consistent pool of workers.","The simple truth is, the short-term solution is for the FDA to allow more importation of safe vaccines from other nations. But the long-term solution is to get more vaccine production within the U.S.","Agreements are always the product of time and place.","Consumers are increasingly feeling that they are being taken for a ride.","Censure is a limp noodle across the wrist of the president.

But a confident bald man - there's your diamond in the rough.","I think we're all good and bad, but good's not funny. Bad is funny. Suppress the good and let the bad out, and then you can be funny.","I don't take on big things. What I do, pretty much, is make the big things small and the small things big.","I don't like to be out of my comfort zone, which is about a half an inch wide.","I'm not a person who embraces challenges. I run from challenges. I break world records running from challenges.","Hey, I may loathe myself, but it has nothing to do with the fact that I'm Jewish.","The lunch in a normal American restaurant is very problematic for me. I don't like to have hot food for lunch.","Switzerland is a place where they don't like to fight, so they get people to do their fighting for them while they ski and eat chocolate.","I had a wonderful childhood, which is tough because it's hard to adjust to a miserable adulthood.","My background is degradation and sloth, mostly.","I have reservations about everything I do.","Even back then, I exuded self-confidence, and that drives women crazy.","You have to discover when you're inadequate to be funny and you don't know you're inadequate when you're a kid.","Anything that's for free, people will take. They don't discriminate.","I think golf is literally an addiction. I'm surprised there's not Golf Anonymous.","I'm really only happy when I'm on stage. I just feed off the energy of the audience. That's what I'm all about - people and laughter.","The addition of nuts in salad... I always find to be beneficial.","When I was living in New York and didn't have a penny to my name, I would walk around the streets and occasionally I would see an alcove or something. And I'd think, that'll be good, that'll be a good spot for me when I'm homeless.","I don't like to make a big splash anyway.","Women love a self-confident bald man.","When you're not concerned with succeeding, you can work with complete freedom.","I'm a walking, talking enigma. We're a dying breed.","I tolerate lactose like I tolerate people.","I don't like to say anything good. I feel like I'll jinx myself.","I'm not quite as anonymous as I was.","Every relationship is just so tenuous and precarious.","The best situation is being a single parent. The best part about is that you get time off, too, because the kids are with their mom, so it's the best of both worlds. There's a lot to be said for it.","You write about what you know.","It's always good to take something that's happened in your life and make something of it comedically.","Trying on pants is one of the most humiliating things a man can suffer that doesn't involve a woman.","I tell people that I've now done one decent thing in my life. Albeit inadvertently.","I learned the first night that IHOP's not the place to order fish.","All of a sudden I discovered that I'm allergic to caviar. It was the perfect metaphor for my life. When I was only able to afford bad caviar, I could certainly eat my fill of it.","Hear the birds? Sometimes I like to pretend that I'm deaf and I try to imagine what it's like not to be able to hear them. It's not that bad.","I'm surprised sometimes at how some of my actions are misinterpreted.","I have quite a house. People come over and I go, 'I know, I'm sorry.'","Drugs scared me.","I just wanted laughs - that's really what I was after.","I think that what people imagine they're going through is much worse than what they are going through.","I just feed off the energy of the audience.","I'm not interested in closure. Some people just have heart attacks and die, right? There's no closure.","OK, I'm happy. I'm happy. All right? I'm happy.","I've been in therapy. I know enough about myself now to know that I really don't need to know anymore.","If I wasn't a golfer, I would still be miserable - but not as miserable.","If you tell the truth about how you're feeling, it becomes funny.","And eventually as I kept writing it, something emerged that was not quite me but a version of me.","At first, I didn't realize it was gonna be a character. I just thought I was gonna be doing me.","I couldn't be happier that President Bush has stood up for having served in the National Guard, because I can finally put an end to all those who questioned my motives for enlisting in the Army Reserve at the height of the Vietnam War.","I don't think anyone really is interested in reading about my emotional state. It's not even interesting to me.","I think that for the most part, when I started doing comedy, it had become very commercialized.","I was planning on my future as a homeless person. I had a really good spot picked out.","I'm a walking, talking enigma.","I've led this empty life for over forty years and now I can pass that heritage on and ensure that the misery will continue for at least one more generation.","It has to do - I think - with growing up in an apartment, with my aunt and my cousins right next door to me, with the door open, with neighbors walking in and out, with people yelling at each other all the time.","It's that I wasn't suited to do the kind of comedy that these people were coming to hear - mainstream comedy.","Most of the time I'm thinking, I'm glad that scene was improvised.","Sure, being a reservist wasn't as glamorous, but I was the one who had to look at myself in the mirror.","The only change I can really see is that I don't have to shop for pants in stores anymore.","Until I started doing standup, there were some very bleak days.","Well, as you know, I'm really only happy when I'm on stage.","In those days, reserve duty lasted for six years, which, I might add, was three times as long as service in the regular army, although to be perfectly honest, I was unable to fulfill my entire obligation because I was taking acting classes and they said I could skip my last year.","It began to dawn on me that perhaps my country needed me more at home than overseas.","There are times when I'm driving home after a day's shooting, thinking to myself, That scene would've been so much better if I had written it out.","There's a sense of spontaneity, and no emphasis on jokes in this show. People generally talk the way they talk in life if you were in this particular situation.","It's not every day that you get to be affectionate around something, it just doesn't happen that often.","I guess I still feel that I'm a comedian; if I had to pick one thing that I feel like I could do, it would be that. That doesn't mean that I like it, but I feel that's what I am.","I was very fortunate to hook up with Jerry in the first place. The network was already committed to doing something with him, so I skipped a couple of hundred steps right there.","Millions of people are married. I've never picked up a paper and seen a headline that says, Man Gets Married!","I wanted to make a living, but I really was not interested in money at all. I was interested in being a great comedian.","I had a job as a paralegal. I drove a cab.","Even though the National Guard and Army Reserve see combat today, it rankles me that people assume it was some kind of waltz in the park back then.","Actually I walk around with the Emmy wherever I go, but I'm very casual about it.","When I was living in New York, there was a lot of screaming in my life. I would just get into these altercations all the time. Being in public, dealing with shopkeepers, just trying to cross the street - things like that.","I can't stand reading anything that I've said.","Well, after the divorce, I went home and turned all the lights on!","If I was going onstage, of course I would talk about it. How could I not?","I defy anyone to produce any evidence that the word 'happy' has ever crossed my lips. I am not now, nor have I ever been, 'happy.'","I'm one of the idiots that negotiates after I write.","Woody Allen likes to do a lot of master shots. He likes to get the whole thing in one take, and so you could be going along doing a scene, and then the next to last line, all of a sudden, you stumble, and you have to go back to first base.","I tend to stay with the panic. I embrace the panic.","Obviously comedic styles do change.","There's also a certain rhythm to the way Jews talk that might be funny.","Once I know people know who I am, it gives me a lot of licence and freedom to behave in ways I wouldn't normally.","People don't yell nasty things at actors - they let them continue.","I still think of that guy I was without a wife or kids, and I still want to entertain that guy. The lonely guy, the frustrated guy, the guy with no money - this is the guy who needs to laugh.","My defensiveness in life really helps me as a driver.","Well, I always think the worst things are going to happen here, because I'm - basically inside, I'm a bad person, and so the bad kind of takes over.","I don't write shows with dialogue where actors have to memorize dialogue. I write the scenes where we know everything that's going to happen. There's an outline of about seven or eight pages, and then we improvise it.","I don't like people cleaning my room.","I'm cranky.","You know, I'm really not that bright.","I never thought for a second that anything I ever did was going to make someone cringe. That never occurred to me.","There's nothing that reflects me. I'm unreflectable!","Sometimes I have these fantasies of just moving to a foreign country and coming back with a full head of hair. Or not even come back! Make a new life there with hair... Change my name, just see what happens.","If I tried to flirt with a woman and she didn't know who I was, she would run away.","Anytime I'm involved with anything that's well-received, it's a surprise to me.","Most people think I'm immodest.","I don't really know much about TV and what people want to see. I'm not that well-informed about it.","Let's not forget, I got divorced.","I think Michael Moore is a hero.","I have no secrets.","I like to be quiet, and let people find me rather than having to shout at them.","I gave a funny speech at my wife's birthday party, and I'm thinking, 'Hey, I've still got it.'","I don't have many friends.","I am not honest.","I believe in something.","Perhaps I have a wider range than I'd given myself credit for.","Most practical jokes, I'll feel too bad for the other person so I'll stop just before the punchline.","I'm anti-cheese in a salad.","Religion doesn't play any part in my life in terms of how I live my life.

They have a really tight group of people working towards the same common goal.","Being happy is very important. We won our second championship last season and we have our entire team coming back to try and defend our title again. I'm very proud of that.","Snake has been everything to me.

You know, I'm married now and I've got two kids. That let's you know you're getting older.","If two people were exactly alike, one of them would be unnecessary.","Because we're sponsored by competing breweries there is always competition. When we were both fighting for ninth or 10th place, nobody really cared except the two companies.","I don't think I ever set my goals that high. As a kid growing up I just wanted an opportunity to race and to be able to make a living doing it. It just came together.","I don't think there is anything owed to us. You've got to go out and work hard for every round win.","I never thought I'd live this long. It sounds funny because I still think of myself as a kid.","I think it's an extremely important factor to have your team together. It goes back to having distractions. When you all stay together for a period of time you're not training people or feeling out different personalities.","The advantage is I have my family with me all the time. When your daughter takes her first steps or says her first words and your son is going through potty training, I'm not missing any of those things.","The championship always goes to the team that wins the most rounds and is the most prepared. I think everybody on our team works hard towards keeping that goal. Time will tell if we're prepared or not.","The same things we've done the past couple of seasons. We've worked on the engine and clutch. We'll try and pick up the performance and consistency of the car and go back out there.","Time will tell how you rate against the rest of the competition. I'll let everyone else worry about championships. I'm going to worry about qualifying at Pomona.","You don't have to find out what someone's mechanical abilities are.

It assumes that people are too stupid, too reckless, and too irresponsible to decide whether and under what conditions to consume drugs. The war on drugs is morally bankrupt.","Studies show that children of divorced parents can have outcomes as positive as those coming from intact homes, provided the father remains financially supportive and active in his children's lives.","This battle for 'common-sense' gun control laws pits emotion and passion against logic and reason.

Doing what you have to do is hard.","The formula for achieving middle-class success is simple: Finish high school; don't have a child before the age of 20; and get married before having the child.","Once brave politicians and others explain the war on drugs' true cost, the American people will scream for a cease-fire. Bring the troops home, people will urge.

Why? In theory, if not practice, the government stays out of the way and lets individuals take risks and reap rewards or accept the consequences of failure. We call this capitalism - or, at least, we used to.","Most people work for the private sector, which cannot exist without profit.","Rent-control laws disproportionately benefit the non-poor because the elite pull strings, work the system and are better connected than the non-poor.","Individuals can spend their money more wisely, efficiently and more humanely than can government.","The No. 1 cause of preventable death for young black men is not auto accidents or accidental drowning, but homicide.","My dad was a Marine. He was one of the Montford Point Marines. Those are the equivalent of the Tuskegee Airmen for Marines. He's a tough, tough guy. When I was 15 we had a fight, and I didn't speak to him for 10 years.","My mom and my dad were married 56 years, and the fact that I reconciled with my dad I think made their marriage a little bit better as well.","If anybody had a reason to become a delinquent, to become a criminal, to be angry at the man, to be angry at the white man, to be angry at America, it's my dad, but he did not feel that way at all.","Nobody ever worked as hard as my father. My father averaged maybe four hours of sleep at night, and when you're a kid, you don't realize that. The man was tired. He was tired.","Raising a child is an on-the-job kind of thing. There aren't a whole lot of manuals for that.","To bring a child into the world that you cannot feed, clothe, house, and educate is the moral equivalent, in my opinion, of a drive-by shooting."],"Larry Ellison":["When you innovate, you've got to be prepared for everyone telling you you're nuts.","We'll continue to expand our footprint... Oracle's Fusion cloud applications for HCM, CRM and ERP all have a new simplified user interface and an integrated social network that makes our enterprise applications as easy-to-use and familiar as Facebook, while enabling better collaboration and teamwork among your employees and your customers.","The social network is the paradigm of the modern service application.","Oracle's latest database, version 12c, was specifically designed for the cloud. Oracle 12c makes all your Oracle applications multitenant applications without you having to make any changes whatsoever to your applications.","Taking care of your employees is extremely important and very, very visible.","When you write a program for Android, you use the Oracle Java tools for everything, and at the very end, you push a button and say, 'Convert this to Android format.'","I have had all of the disadvantages required for success.","What is Oracle?

People don't like change. A bunch of people don't like the Olympics now because we've added skateboarding... We're modernizing the sport.","Bill Gates wants people to think he's Edison, when he's really Rockefeller. Referring to Gates as the smartest man in America isn't right... wealth isn't the same thing as intelligence.","Bill Gates is the pope of the personal computer industry. He decides who's going to build.","A corporation's primary goal is to make money. Government's primary role is to take a big chunk of that money and give it to others.","What is Oracle? It's people. We rely on our HR department to build this organization, to help find those people, to help grow those people.","I'm going to start these art museums that are basically converted homes, and I have one for modern art, and I have one for 19th century European art, and one for French impressionism. I've got Japanese.","It's Microsoft versus mankind, with Microsoft having only a slight lead.","To model yourself after Steve Jobs is like, 'I'd like to paint like Picasso, what should I do? Should I use more red?'","I started NetSuite. NetSuite was my idea. I called up Evan Goldberg and said, 'We're going to do ERP on the Internet, software-as-a-service.' Six months later Marc Benioff, finding out what NetSuite was doing, and kind of copied it.","They don't call it the Internet anymore, they call it cloud computing. I'm no longer resisting the name.

But the reintroduction of commercial agriculture to Lanai is 100% dependent upon increasing the available water on the island. So we're going to use solar energy to convert seawater to fresh water.","I'm in two modes when I'm on Lanai: In engineering mode, I'm trying to find the right place for the reservoir and the desalination plant, and looking at designs for new hotel rooms. The rest of the time, I'm in decompression mode. I'm on Hulopoe Beach, going for a swim, or on my paddleboard surrounded by 100 spinner dolphins.","Maui reminded me of San Diego: beautiful, but crowded.","It's surreal to think that I own this beautiful island. It doesn't feel like anyone can own Lanai.

If my parents were lucky - poor parents! - I would be home before it got dark.","Game-playing is more fun when it's virtual because you're more successful. ... in reality, only one person gets to be LeBron.","My favorite museums are things like the Frick Museum in New York and the Huntington Hartford in Pasadena where it's someone's home that you walk through.","I own a home in Kyoto, Japan actually on the temple on grounds in Nanzenji that is going to become a Japanese art museum.","One of the great things about Lanai is that the weather is always fabulous. Always 82 degrees and sunny. The problem is that, like California now, Lanai needs more water.","Lanai at one time grew 98% of the world's pineapples. But the world's pineapples are now grown in two places, Costa Rica and Panama, because no one wants to spend $45 for a pineapple from the United States.","We saw - we conducted the experiment.

Now, we're gonna see Apple without Steve Jobs."],"Larry Fitzgerald":["You can never let anything distract you from your main objective. My only goal is to be great. That's all I want. That's all I ever aspire to be. Greatness is something nobody can ever take away from you, no matter what happens. So I put all my energy and focus into my craft.","I have some sweets now and then, but I wouldn't say I have a major sweet tooth.","You have to find something that you want to accomplish, that you want to achieve. You want to drop 15 pounds. You want to be able to run four miles. There has to be some goal that you set for yourself and, after you've reached that goal, you set a new one. You always have to be shooting for something, striving for something.","I've always thought about my legacy - more so, though, my impact off the field and how I'm helping my community and solidifying and strengthening the lives of others around me. And also, I just want to be a dominant football player, too. So it encompasses everything.","I really enjoy my philanthropic work, traveling around the world and helping people in need. That's a lot of fun for me. It's really rewarding. You're helping people, but it's helping you, too. It puts life in perspective when you come back and you say, 'Man, it's raining again in Minnesota.'","Pretty much I love all types of fish; I pretty much stick with that. I love vegetables. I don't eat too much carbs, but I love salads, though. I'll usually have a salad, except for breakfast.","I've got the Xbox 360, a Wii, and a PlayStation 3. I got everything you could think of.","My mother was a great inspiration to me to always do my best. My father has always been my mentor and friend. They taught me the basic principle that guides most all that I do: faith, focus, finish.","I go to Australia probably once every two years. It's wide-open spaces there, so I just rent a motorcycle and ride out to the middle of the continent. For hours, you don't see anybody.","I'm kind of shy, to be honest. If I go to the pool or something, I keep my shirt on unless I'm getting in the water.","I love to see new things, and I love to learn. I always learn so much when I travel - that's the best thing.","I joined forces with the American Cancer Society in 2010 as a spokesperson for the N.F.L.'s 'A Crucial Catch' campaign, which benefits the American Cancer Society. This was important to me because I lost my mother to breast cancer, and I have always felt a strong commitment to doing all I can to fight this disease.","I enjoy playing for the Arizona Cardinals, and I want to continue to play here and try to win.","I went to a military school, so I'm always talking like 'Yes, sir,' or 'No, ma'am.' I was doing that even before military school, so I've always had it, I guess.","Just losing a couple pounds takes so much stress off your joints. Your body feels better.","I was fortunate to have a grandfather who was an optometrist. Vision therapy was something that we routinely did to strengthen our eyes and give us better focus. I was fortunate that he could teach me techniques that are still paying dividends for me to this day.","My dad used to give me a lot of spankings. Anything I did wrong, he was on me. I was raised by a strict disciplinarian. He kind of laid down the law.","If you play football, there's going to be a 100 percent injury rate. Something is going to be bothering you. So I just try to focus on the things that I can do to help my team.","Chess is a lot of fun for me. Football is a physical game, and in chess you can just beat someone mentally - you outwit somebody, outmaneuver them, think ahead of them.","My diet is always extremely important to me. I've taken a new approach to eating in terms of my blood type. I really don't eat much chicken, sugar, salts, or beef. Just eating clean and feeling so much better.","Crossword puzzles, Sudoku... I'm good at all those things. It's not daily, but I'll do stuff on the airplane. I love playing chess. It's my favorite game.","In terms of me being a Christian, going to Israel was really cool. Going to the West Bank, Bethlehem, floating in the Dead Sea - that was great for me.","The more playoff games and Super Bowls and things of that nature that you're in obviously is going to build your portfolio and raise your visibility.","I was very fortunate to have some great mentors. A father that was always in my life set the example every day at home. Everybody asks me, 'What was your role model?' My role model slept 20 feet from me every night. I could always go talk to him and ask him questions no matter what it was about.","The Hit Stick is a tremendous invention. It really gave you control as a defensive player because most of the time, 'Madden' is such an offensive game. But the Hit Stick really gave you the opportunity to shine on defense for the first time.","I enjoy working with the American Cancer Society because I fully support its mission of saving lives and creating a world with less cancer and more birthdays for everyone.","It's rewarding to be recognized by the fans and other players for my abilities and to be able to represent the Arizona Cardinals fans from around the world.","Every guy has different strengths in the NFL. Receivers are different, running backs are different, but they all have that one thing that they do that's special: that thing that keeps them on the roster every year.","For being a young guy, I'm articulate and can hold a decent conversation with somebody. But I've been able to do that since I was young. I don't think that has to do too much with schooling, it has more to do with the people I was raised around, my parents. I have respect for adults.","For me, take Tiger Woods. I always thought he was great, but I never truly understood how good he was until I had the chance to go to Tiger Woods Golf Camp. He taught me how to swing and was hitting the ball, and this dude was unreal.","There are certain things that I do - I don't eat chicken or pork. I stay away from red meat a lot; I eat fish most of the time. I think it makes me feel cleaner, not just body wise. I feel good.","Chicken... I am a black man, we love our chicken, but I don't eat it anymore. My genotype means I don't process it as well as other things. But I eat lamb twice a week; that is a super food for me.","My energy levels are off the charts. I can run all day, I breathe well, and I sweat a lot, so the toxins and impurities come out of my body.","I've traveled all the way around the world; I've been to over 95 countries, so I love ethnic food, different types of cuisine.","I can never let the guy across from me be in better shape. I have to be the best-conditioned guy.","When you don't know how to cook, you just say, 'I need something quick,' and then you fry something up. Now that I cook, I think, 'Do I want to have fried fish, baked fish, or grilled fish?'","I work legs, upper body, everything. Legs are very important. I do hang cleans and squats - I do primary exercises. Squats work over 60 percent of your muscle mass in your body. The hang cleans work on my explosive movement, which is essential for success.","Jerry Rice had won two Super Bowls already by the time he got to his ninth year in the league. That's what it's all about: winning that ring.","When you think of Peyton Manning, you think 'ambassador.' The game has grown exponentially during his career because of him and what he means to our game, not only as a football player but as a humanitarian."],"Larry Flynt":["The two most misused words in the entire English vocabulary are love and friendship. A true friend would die for you, so when you start trying to count them on one hand, you don't need any fingers.","If you're not going to offend somebody you don't need the First Amendment.","You will encounter many distractions and many temptations to put your goal aside: The security of a job, a wife who wants kids, whatever. But if you hang in there, always following your vision, I have no doubt you will succeed.","And a democracy can't exist without free speech and the right to assemble. And that's what Americans tend to forget. And they're born into a culture where they take all of their freedoms for granted.","You know, everybody believes in free speech until you start questioning them about it.","The only question to ask yourself is, how much are you willing to sacrifice to achieve this success?","Politics is my hobby. Smut is my vocation.","Hypocrisy is a detriment to progress. There's always a hidden agenda.","I will concede to you one thing - 'Hustler' is offensive, even to the point of being iconoclastic. That's our purpose - to be offensive.","Well, one thing, you got to stand in a courtroom and listen to a judge sentencing you to 25 years in prison before you realize that freedom of expression can no longer be taken for granted.","Privacy is not explicitly spelled out in the Constitution as freedom of speech is in the First Amendment.","Nothing can make you more humble than pain.","Majority rule only works if you're also considering individual rights. Because you can't have five wolves and one sheep voting on what to have for supper.","Moses freed the Jews. Lincoln freed the slaves. I freed the neurotics.","I may be paralyzed from the waist down, but unlike Gray Davis, I'm not paralyzed from the neck up.","You have to be able to tolerate what you don't necessarily like so you can be free.","The right-wing of the Republican party isn't so much a political agenda as a plea for help.","In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled that individual communities should set obscenity standards. Whenever a case is tried, it will be based on a community standard for that particular place.","Being in a wheelchair for 30 years. I'm not whining about it because I don't dwell on things I can't do anything about, you know. I never really think about until somebody mentions it. I did take a bullet.","Religion has caused more harm than any other idea since the beginning of time. There's nothing good I can say about it. People use it as a crutch.","Any time there's a scandal, we always try and get involved.","These days... it's all vanilla sex for me.","There's nothing that will change someone's moral outlook quicker than cash in large sums.","I don't think many people anticipated how the Internet was going to revolutionize the way we disseminate information.","People aren't interested in others controlling what they can do or read or see in the privacy of their own homes.","I used to buy into a former Supreme Court justice's argument that you can't scream fire in a crowded theater. Well, I think you can.","After the first million, money isn't important."],"Larry Gagosian":["The sun never sets on my gallery.","The more people who look at great art, the better for our culture.","Take Damien Hirst out of contemporary art history, and there's an incredible void. Great artists, like great people, have second acts.","Honestly, I grew up in pretty modest circumstances. We were a middle-class family.","I was always very focused on how people dressed.","I never really took a proper art class in college. I just started reading art magazines and going to galleries. I was really drawn to it.","You get to a point where you really can't manage more artists, because representing artists takes a lot of time.","When a great artist gets my attention, I pursue it. If I don't, someone else will, you know what I'm saying?","I don't wear plaid shirts.","The art market is global now, and there's becoming more of an international consensus about what constitutes good art.","Physically, it's getting impossible for me to travel that much. I want to support my artists by showing up at their openings, but I can't always be in Hong Kong one minute and Geneva the next.","I'm not in the luxury-goods business. I sell unique objects. I wish I was in luxury goods because then I could just call the factory and say, 'I need 10,000 more of whatever.' But I can't - because then it's not art, it's something else.","The art world is never going to be popular like the NFL, but more people are buying art and I think that's cushioning, to a great extent, our art-market cycles.","I don't think the art market is for everybody. Yeah, of course we have a global gallery. But we're like the one-tenth of the one-tenth of the one-tenth. OK? Not just who's buying but who's really seriously engaged with art.","I believe in the popularizing of art. But when you get right down to it, it's a bit of an elitist world. Not just economically elitist - how many people read poetry?","I've never been what they call a 'pure gallerist.' I find that somewhat pretentious, honestly - I'm an art dealer. I like to show great artists of our time, but I also like dealing. And I think they reinforce each other.","Nobody really needs a painting. It's something you kind of create value for in a way that you don't with a company. It's an act of collective faith what an object is worth. Maintaining that value system is part of what a dealer does, not just making a transaction but making sure that important art feels important.","Some people buy art because they're confident that it'll be a good store value, and this is kind of a recent phenomenon.","Naturally, liquidity is a big factor in any market that seems to be a lot of money in the world, and there's a lot of discretionary money.","I have a good visual memory. I'm good with faces, but names - I get in trouble a lot; I can't seem to remember people. People think I'm rude. As a side comment, you know, I'm not being rude: I just kind of blank out.","Good jazz has been a big part of my life as far as my interest in music, and... It's kind of weird now with music, the way technology is, with downloading and iPods and electronic distribution, and its kind of - you miss something, I think.","I've never been on a board, but I just went on the board for Jazz at Lincoln Center. I'm very happy about that.","My gallery represents a lot of figurative artists.","You have to be a little bit cautious when the market gets quite strong because there's a tendency to anoint a genius artist every other day. That would be a word of advice for the collectors out there.","San Francisco has always been a great city for art collectors."],"Larry Gelbart":["Most jokes state a bitter truth.","If vaudeville had died, television was the box they put it in.","Today's audience knows more about what's on television than what's in life.","One doesn't have a sense of humor.

I could get away with anything - bribery, blackmail and adultery. But I got caught by cancer. I do want everyone to know that it is a very common and treatable form of cancer. I will be receiving treatment while working on the new 'Dallas' series.","'Dallas' hit a chord back in the late Seventies and Eighties because it was the age of greed: here you have this unapologetic character who is mean and nasty and ruthless and does it all with an evil grin. I think people related to JR back then because we all have someone we know exactly like him. Everyone in the world knows a JR.","I did successfully kick tobacco at the age of 34. I smoked for like 20 years, from 14 to 34.","If you do your research on hot springs all over the world, they're usually places of peace. People, even in warring nations and so forth, they'll go and live in peace together around the hot springs, which were always considered medicinal. I firmly believe in water therapy.","Comedy is not funny. Comedy is hard work and timing and lots and lots of rehearsals.","It's my firm intention to whop cancer into submission and I truly believe I've given myself the best start possible by radically overhauling my diet and by staying true to my motto, which is: Don't worry, be happy, feel good. The first thing I did when I was diagnosed was to turn vegan.","I've travelled a huge amount, but almost all of it has been through work. I spent five years stationed in London in the special services of the American Air Force, producing and directing shows for the troops, which I absolutely loved.","There are very little things in this life I cannot afford and patience is one of them.","You know Hollywood is a weird and wonderful place, I didn't know I Dream of Jeanie had been cancelled after 5 years until I went back to go on the lot to pick up some clothes and things I had in my dressing room.","Well, I decided to stop. And I did. I stopped smoking, and I stopped speed at the same time.","Well yes so far, I was recently in Germany and they had me do six book signings a day and that was too much so I had them cut it down to about three. It becomes taxing at times but its a lot of fun and you meet a lot of nice people.","Well I think they broke the mould when they made me and being humble is one of my great assets.","No no there wasn't any planned 14th season, we all saw the writing on the wall. The ratings had been going down and so fourth, that curve goes on every show and in everybody's life.","Marijuana you can give up, Iv given it up for fifteen years now and it never occurs to me to smoke it anymore.","Later on when it became a routine it was not as exciting I'll admit that. The first three years were wonderful, the rest were just money making and having fun.","I'm sure it is, I'm not for any kind of war, we've been engaged in several wars since the second world war and we lost in Korea, we lost in Vietnam, they are political wars, they have nothing to do with any real threat, nor does this one.","I'm not well versed on the verbiage of the internet.","I was shot when I think it was number one. That was the catalyst for the interest in the show. Certainly it went on for a long time after that but that's what really kicked it off. Of course a lot of people watched it just because of the novelty of the situation.","I was sad to see anybody leave, we had a very nice family on that show. I was very sad to see momma go, Victoria and especially Linda. My god that was my wife on the show, in fact my wife calls her wife.","I think they could of recast the children, I heard of people wanting to do something like that. That would be a nice little show to do but you know that show was of the 80's, I don't think the audience mind set is in that direction any longer.","I liked Dallas better because it was more deceptive, you could do more with it.","I guess it was but I think peoples morality has changed. It's gotten more liberal and more diverse and even in a sense much more fundamental, you take the fundamental religious right in this country, its got to go back about 50 years.","I didn't write the book to sell the book, but to tell my experiences.","I admit the last couple of years shows were not up to par.","But there is no withdrawal, but with tobacco there is terrible withdrawal, it is almost impossible for a lot of people. I did, I went cold turkey, they never had any patches in those days but grass was not difficult, alcohol not difficult, but tobacco - oh my god.","After ten or twelve years you can only play something so long and then you start to parody it.","My definition of a redundancy is an air-bag in a politician's car.","I'm happy to be here.

Also, I damn well deserve it!","Don't you find that the more you know, the more you don't know and can't ever learn because there's too much stuff out there?","Good acting is all in the writing. If it isn't on the page, then it really won't make any difference. You cannot act on force of personality alone.","Major success feels a bit like a coronation. Like I'd become a king. I was one of the most famous people in the world, loved and hated in equal measure. I couldn't see anything bad with it. It made me a happy person.","I have been married for 58 years to the same woman. Our secret? Separate bathrooms.","Actors can't retire. What would they do?","There used to be three networks, and now there are 40 million networks. There's a lot more competition out there, too. We would bring in 27 million people. Now, they're lucky if they have 17. I looked at the ratings, for the first time in 25 years, just to see, and there were 130 shows on. There used to be maybe 30.","I don't watch a lot of television. Sports and news, that's it.","My television and movie career has also taken me all over the world. I've had great times in the Far East, Russia, South America and Sweden - where I met my wife of 55 years, Maj.","If I really had to pinpoint my happiest days out of the United States, I'd choose those Fifties military days in Britain, particularly my time in South Ruislip. I had a ball.","I never travel without my Stetson, but the more I wear it the more I realise that no one wears hats any more. When I was a kid everybody wore hats, especially in Texas, but I get off the plane in Dallas now and I'm the only guy with a hat. It's amazing.","I'd like to play Matt Damon's daddy. He's a wonderful actor, I really admire him, and I'd like to play his dad one day.","I barely watch TV apart from the news. Most of it is rubbish. There's all this reality nonsense and dross. I think there's a market for a well-produced, well-written melodrama like 'Dallas.' It's pure entertainment.","When we started the show, 'Dallas' was known as the city where JFK was assassinated. By the end it was known as JR's home town.","It always annoys me when stars grumble about fans coming up to them in the street. I love it. These young stars today with all their airs and graces, they need to remember it is an honour and a privilege to make money from acting. How hard is it?","We did 356 'Dallas' episodes between 1978 and 1991. The most memorable moment for me happened in 1980 when I got shot at the end of the third series. The rest is a blur.","I think that everybody in the world, whatever colour or creed, has a jerk like JR in his or her family somewhere. Whether it is a father, uncle, cousin or brother, everybody can identify with JR and that certainly had something to do with the success of 'Dallas.'","I have this wonderful personal chef who sources and stocks all my organic produce and I basically live on five smoothies a day. I'm totally vegan. I blend this green concoction with kale, cucumber, broccoli, string beans, avocado. My protein comes from protein powder. There is absolutely no milk, butter, cheese.","I exercise every morning. I do light weights - 5lb and 10lb arm exercises - and then lie and lift my arms and legs. It's all about keeping core strength. I do a lot of stretching too.","I went to a military school between the ages of six and 12 and later into the air force. You learn discipline and strength of character."],"Larry Harvey":["We take people to the threshold of religion. Our aim is to induce immediate experience that is beyond the odd, beyond the strange, and beyond the weird. It verges on the wholly other.","I've learned never to expect people to be better than they are, but to always have faith that they can be more.","Black Rock gives us all a chance to heal, to become ourselves.","When I was in my late 30s, I lit a figure on fire on Baker Beach in San Francisco. It was me, a friend, and maybe eight people, tops. There wasn't any premeditation to it at all. It was really just a product of San Franciscan bohemian milieu.","Well it seems to me, that all real communities grow out of a shared confrontation with survival. Communities are not produced by sentiment or mere goodwill. They grow out of a shared struggle. Our situation in the desert is an incubator for community.","It avoids a self-conscious relationship to the act. We live in the most self-conscious society in the history of mankind. There are good things in that, but there are also terrible things. The worst of it is, that we find it hard to give ourselves to the cultural process.","They become the keepers of the mystery. They place themselves between the communicants of the religion, and the immediate experience. And then they dictate the terms on which you can have contact with this wonderful mystery. We don't dictate those terms.","I'm actually a very shy person. You'd be surprised how many leaders are shy. They're not all extroverts by nature.","Belief is thought at rest.","Kleenex would have made a mint today.","I grew up on a farm in Oregon, an adopted child, with one sibling, and parents the age of all my peers' grandparents. We lived in isolation from the people around us, and it was always a struggle to cope with as a child. The heart can really expire under those conditions. I always felt like I was looking at the world from the outside."],"Larry Hogan":["We want people to have the right to express their concerns and frustration and protest in a peaceful manner.","No state can match the beauty of the Chesapeake Bay, our beaches and farms, or the mountains of Western Maryland, the Port of Baltimore, or the historic charm of every corner of our state.","Let's find those areas where modest and reasonable tax cuts will have the biggest positive impact on our economy, and which will improve the lives of those who need it most: working families, retirees, and small business owners.","To see the faces and hear the voices of victims of the Holocaust - one of the darkest chapters in history - was an experience I will never forget.","School after Labor Day is now the law of the land in Maryland.","We're the first not-white family to ever live in the governor's mansion. My son-in-law is Puerto Rican. I have a beautiful little granddaughter who is half Korean and half Latina. I'm the only white guy in the house.","Too often, we see wedge politics and petty rhetoric used to belittle adversaries and inflame partisan divisions.","Politicians make phony promises all the time that they can't deliver.","We need to encourage innovative ideas that give parents better alternatives to prepare children for higher education and for the jobs of the future.","I believe that every child in Maryland deserves a world-class education, regardless of what neighborhood they grow up in.","We are not opposed to public transportation. We are opposed to wasteful boondoggles.","I have nothing to do with Donald Trump.","If you want my answer about Donald Trump, you can Google it. It's everywhere. They've got this new thing called Google.","I'm not a Trump fan. I don't think he should be the nominee.","I get asked that almost every day, but I've been saying the same thing... I'm not going to take any more stupid questions about Donald Trump. It's not what I focus on every day.","Crime is out of control in Baltimore City.","I've had completely gray hair since, like, 30.","You can disagree without being disagreeable. That's always been my mantra.","I try not to make it personal, and I don't care about partisan politics one way or the other.","Supporting iconic, growth-oriented industries, combined with tax policies that encourage small business growth and investment, represents a potent combination and is the basis of our entire administration.","Creating sustainable jobs means doubling down on Baltimore's formidable strengths.","I love Baltimore and the people who call it home, and I sincerely believe that Maryland's biggest city must serve as the economic and cultural heart of our state.","Baltimore residents deserve a commitment from leaders to deliver meaningful changes and the possibility of a better future, and so does every Marylander who loves our great state.","In addition to reining in spending, taxes, tolls and fees, let's rein in how much the state borrows.","Let's set aside political gamesmanship and work together for the sake of our children.","Marylanders are among the nation's hardest working and most educated people. We have universities and schools that are among the best in the nation.","The problems we face aren't Democratic problems or Republican problems. These are Maryland's problems.","The joke around my office is that I've shaken many hands, but I've petted more dogs.","I'm a pretty plain-spoken guy.","I could stand to lose some weight.","A lot of people have it tougher than I do.","The legacy of the Freddie Gray unrest? I think that remains to be determined.","It's a tragedy. It was tragedy for Freddie Gray and the family. It was a tragedy for the city. And we're still trying to figure out how it happened and why it happened.","I've made it very clear that building, maintaining, and fixing Maryland's roads and bridges is our top transportation priority, and it is a top priority of our administration.","We are going to have to make some very difficult choices, because state government cannot continue to spend more than it takes in.","For years, I have repeatedly said that Maryland taxpayers were being overtaxed and overcharged.","In Maryland, we have the unfortunate distinction of being the most gerrymandered state in the entire nation.","People don't care about questionnaires.","I'm not going to roll back anything. Nothing is going to change with respect to reproductive rights.","I've never supported one penny of tuition increases.","I don't want to over-promise and under-deliver.","We don't have a revenue problem in Annapolis. We have a spending problem we need to control.","Make no mistake: Restoring our economy is very much a women's issue.","Women are the heads of most households in our state and make the most financial decisions for their families.","It doesn't matter to me if someone is a Republican or a Democrat, I'm going to be the governor for all Marylanders.","The polls and the pundits and the media seem to talk to each other. It's sort of like an echo chamber.","I was talking to Marylanders... What we were hearing, everywhere, was an overwhelming sense of frustration. People felt a huge disconnect between Annapolis and the rest of Maryland.","Every single day, everywhere we went, people were coming up to me and Boyd repeatedly and saying, 'We're life-long Democrats, but we're voting for you. We've never voted for a Republican in our life.'","We're a nation of immigrants.","To those who would divide us or drive us to the extremes of either political party, I remind you that Maryland has been called 'a state of middle temperament.' Our politics need that middle temperament as well.","It is only when the partisan shouting stops that we can hear each other's voices and concerns."],"Larry Holmes":["I don't really make plans and I just want to be happy and continue with my business and take care of my wife and kids. I want to sit back, relax and enjoy life.","I have a lot of friends and fans in Canada and as a matter of fact I met a fan from there that came down to my office. It was nice and we took pictures and had a nice talk.","George Foreman is easier and has the bigger name and have you noticed that Foreman never calls me out or ever mentions my name? He is afraid of me like most fighters are and most people want to forget about Larry Holmes, like he never ever existed.","I don't think Joe Louis could take the punches today fighting in this era.","With a record of 75 fights and 6 losses, some of the losses were very questionable including Brian Nielsen when we fought in Denmark. I knew I won but they didn't give me that fight.","I always felt good about myself. I was just an average person. I always felt I could do anything anyone else could. If an average person makes up their mind to do something, they can.","It's hard being black. You ever been black? I was black once - when I was poor.","All fighters are prostitutes and all promoters are pimps.","Ali was a guy that had a lot of discipline. If you hung around him, you'd be able to get some of that discipline that he had. And I learned from that. He was a sweet man.","Bob Arum and Don King can do their thing but if I fought for those guys and they put the money up like they are supposed to then I don't have a problem.","Everybody knows that I am one of the greatest fighters of all time and I would beat all those guys.","Fighters today are much bigger, stronger and quicker and not only that but referees, judges and doctors back then were very strict and if your head got busted up the fight would be stopped.","I am still quick at 250 to 260 lbs and I am smarter.","I never tried to be a mercenary or a killer but a hard working fighter.","I still feel that I am in my prime right now but I think my best fights were in my thirties.","I think Ali was a fan of mine, even though he never said it. A lot of fighters thought I was pretty good. Nobody every really spoke different on that. But a lot of fighters thought I was good so.","I think George Foreman must have gained about 350 lbs and is slow as ever.","I was probably the best that ever walked this earth. And I could take a punch. I could deliver a punch. I didn't have the hardest punch in the world but my punches were sharp and they were crisp. And if you took too many of them, you would be knocked out.","I would think about the outcome. Visualize sometimes. Because it never comes out the way you want it to. Fight the way I know how to fight. Whatever comes up, comes up.","I'm not in the K-1 tournament. We thought about it but they really don't want me as they feel I might get hurt so that's fine with me but I do see a lot of guys out there that I feel I can take.","Mike Tyson would have been a good sparring partner for me and Muhammad Ali because Tyson was a fast fighter and he could punch and throw good combinations.","Muhammad could take a very good punch. He was slick, he could move, he could hit, make you miss, good hand speed and combinations and one of the greatest fighters of all time in my opinion.","My fans know the name Larry Holmes and that he always gave it his all.","One of the best ones out there was a guy named Howard Cosell. He was the best.","The guys today are just too strong and back then they would take many hard punches to land one.","Those guys were made for me and Muhammad because they come straight in and don't back up but you had to watch out for his punching power but if we could have neutralized that then we would have been fine.","We put our life on the line to fight for them, put on a show and these guys take our money so whatever happens to Bob Arum, Don King or anyone else is fine with me.","You can't put those guys like Marciano or anyone else in with today's class of fighters.","I came from a dirt farm, now I'm filthy rich."],"Larry Hovis":["I didn't equate a POW camp with a concentration camp.","At some point, you've got to realize, you're either a leading man or you're not.","I had to be sure we were doing something tasteful.","Any competent actor could have done what I did.","I was probably never going to get to do the kind of things dramatically that I really wanted to do, so I returned to theater from time to time, and to write, and produce. It's by no means sour grapes."],"Larry J. Sabato":["The presidential candidates are offering prescriptions for everything from Iraq to healthcare, but listen closely. Their fixes are situational and incremental. Meanwhile, the underlying structural problems in American politics and government are systemic and prevent us from solving our most intractable challenges.","We all live in the moment, and we often mistakenly believe that what is true today was true always. Not so in politics, and especially in Congressional elections.","If we really want to make progress and achieve greater fairness as a society, it is time for elemental change. And we should start by looking at the Constitution, with the goal of holding a new Constitutional Convention.","Because of the structure of the contemporary American party system, every president is polarizing.","Shockingly, the Bidens donated under $1,000 to all charities combined every year for the ten years prior to 2008.","I doubt God would want to touch America's tax code, since it is already located in the third rung of Hell.","Politics is a good thing!","The Constitution remains brilliant in its overall design and sound with respect to the Bill of Rights and the separation of powers. But there are numerous archaic provisions that inhibit constructive change and adaptation. These constitutional bits affect the daily life of the republic and every citizen in it."],"Larry King":["I remind myself every morning: Nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So if I'm going to learn, I must do it by listening.","Communications is the number one major in America today. CNN had 25,000 applicants for five intern jobs this summer.","I don't wish anybody ill, I really don't. I've got a lot of faults, but I was never jealous or envious or... it's a waste of time.","The names are bigger, the show is worldwide, but I get a royal pass into life in the broadcasting business.","I love doing what I do. I love asking questions. I love being in the mix.","I've got a nice car. I love my job. I've got a bagel store, and I have breakfast every morning with friends I grew up with. I've been in movies, I've written books - I don't know how that all happened.","It's joyful to give. But for people who want to take advantage of you, you're kind of an easy mark.","I just love asking questions. I love people. It's in my DNA. I'm cursed - and blessed.","I'm the worst person to be stuck with in a traffic jam.","I did everything when I started. In Miami I did news, I did weather, I did sports, I did disk-jockeying. And I did a sports talk show every week - every Saturday night.","You gotta ask 'why' questions. 'Why did you do this?' A 'why' question you can't answer with one word.","I worked at CNN for almost 26 years. I worked in Mutual Radio for 20 years. I've been in the business 57 years. I have never seen a bias off the air or on.","The Kardashians can be famous for being famous. What do they do? I can't figure it out.","An NBA game in L.A., the Lakers - I'm a Clipper fan - it's to be seen as much as seeing the game.","I like getting to the meat of things. You can't get it in a five-minute interview. I like to hone a person. I like to make eye contact.","Getting your house in order and reducing the confusion gives you more control over your life. Personal organization some how releases or frees you to operate more effectively.","I fantasized being a broadcaster.","I'm having as much fun today as I did when I made $55 a week, because it is as much fun.","I'm sort of the comic relief after a hard day at work. My message is that it's OK to relax.","I've never seen anyone say, 'Let's go get this person today; let's really ram it into him.' I've never seen it. If a Democrat or Republican commits some horrendous story, the story will run. The networks will cover it.","Those who have succeeded at anything and don't mention luck are kidding themselves.","Good writers are in the business of leaving signposts saying, Tour my world, see and feel it through my eyes; I am your guide.","I have never understood the Iowa caucus.","With 500 channels and the Internet available, you'd think a candidate could get the word out.","When I was 5 years old I would lie in bed, look at the radio, and I wanted to be on the radio. I don't know why.","I worked on the United Parcel Service truck, I sold home delivery of milk. But always, in the back of my mind, I wanted to get into radio.","I was always telling everyone, I want to be a broadcaster. They'd say, What, are you crazy? What, you're going to be Arthur Godfrey?","If they asked me, I did two shifts. I did sports, I did news, because I loved it.","Gleason became like a mentor of mine. I had Gleason helping me on television, Godfrey on radio.","I have lifelong friends. My oldest friend, Herbie, has been a friend since I was 9. I've had bonds for over 50 years with people.","If I do something caring for a friend, I have no doubt in my mind they would do it for me.","I've made a lot of mistakes. I've bonded with some people who use you, and some people that take advantage of you.","I like to put a stake in people, because I know people helped me.","Les Miserables is one of my favorite stories.","People would pay money to work at CNN.","When I broke in, in 1957, it was wide open. Now you're up against strong competition.","If you do something, expect consequences.","I never think of access or good will. I just want a good interview. I want guests to be informative and entertaining. I've never been concerned about someone's liking me tomorrow.","I'm from Brooklyn. In Brooklyn, if you say, 'I'm dangerous', you'd better be dangerous.","Sandy Koufax went to the same school as me. I graduated two years ahead of Sandy.","My father died when I was nine and a half. We were on relief for two years. They call it welfare now, but it was relief then... I never forgot the generosity of New York.","I've taken my boys to the house I grew up in. Taken them to the site of Ebbets Field, where the Dodgers used to play. They go to all the Dodger games, and they play Little League ball. I have infused them with New York spirit.","I'm 80 years old, and I don't know what I'm going to be when I grow up.","I had no trouble going from radio to TV - I just thought of TV as radio with pictures.","I never use the word 'I' when I interview someone. I think it's irrelevant.","Sports are my favorite. It's the first thing I turn to every day.","Who wouldn't want to be Frank Sinatra's son?","I want to be frozen on the hope that they'll find whatever I died of and bring me back.","My biggest fear is death because I don't think I'm going anywhere. And since I don't think that, and I don't have a belief... I'm married to someone who has the belief, so she knows she's going somewhere.","People sometimes think I'm sort of all-knowing.","When you reach a certain age, and people see you on television, they look at you and think, 'Wow! Everything must be great!' Well, everything isn't always great. You can be hailed on the street corner, but you still have to go home and take out the garbage.","I have never seen anyone at CNN ever say, 'Boy, here's how we're going to deal with this today to put this guy down and elevate this guy up.' I've never seen it.","They don't have a lot of appointment viewing. What television depends on, one thing 'Larry King Live' was - whether you liked it, didn't like it - it was appointment viewing.","Basically, what it comes down to is I love what I do. I don't do it for fame. I don't do it for money. I just love it.","I never forgot being poor, and I never stopped thinking how fortunate I am.","The rich don't win elections. They support the money, but what percentage of America are rich? What is it, 2 percent? But they all have one vote.","Anything can happen when people run for office.","I've done hundreds of interviews on guns. I'm against people who use guns. I don't like guns, but I've never yelled at anyone.","I thought I would be a sports announcer. All I was was a curious kid who wanted to be on the radio.","The guest to me was always paramount.","I don't know what a softball question is. All I know is I have no agenda. I ask short questions, and I listen to the answer.","I've had a great ride. I've got no complaints."],"Larry Kirshbaum":["I'm sure in a lot of publishing houses that there is a frustration that people feel, that they're not in control, that they are puppets and the corporate bosses are manipulating the strings.","A nonfiction author has to bring a platform with him - radio, a TV show or some kind of recognizable vehicle to help launch them. And the agent is really necessary to represent all of the business interests of the author.","I'd only been in the business three or four years, but I told myself that someday I'd like to be Mort Janklow.","If the books are selling, the money will follow."],"Larry Kramer":["AIDS was allowed to happen. It is a plague that need not have happened. It is a plague that could have been contained from the very beginning.","AIDS is a plague - numerically, statistically and by any definition known to modern public health - though no one in authority has the guts to call it one.","I don't consider myself an artist. I consider myself a very opinionated man who uses words as fighting tools.","I now realize that I am a gay man before anything else. Other gays may think they're a Jew first, or black, or a banker, but I'm gay.","The most important fact is that gays have been here since day one. To say otherwise is a gross denial and stupidity. We played an enormous part in the history of America.","There's no question that the gay movement would not be as far along as it is without AIDS. But how can there be any other issue in the face of death, possible extinction?","Living with AIDS is like always having the sword of Damocles over your head. The disease is scarier than death itself. The disease is so messy, so devastating, so pervasive. It robs you of everything you hold dear.","I do not think the gay population has been all that rabid for gay marriage. Note that I do not use the words 'gay community.' Expunge that expression from your vocabulary. We are not a community.","Too many people hate the people that AIDS most affects: gay people and people of color. I do not mean dislike, or feel uncomfortable with. I mean hate. Downright hate. Down and dirty hate.","I was at Yale from 1953 to 1957, and I tried to commit suicide in my freshman year because I was gay, and I thought I was the only person in the school who was. I was just totally and utterly miserable.","We didn't exist. Ronald Reagan didn't say the word 'AIDS' until 1987. I've tried desperately to get a meeting in the White House; Gay Men's Health Crisis is already an established organization. I have a certain presence.","The media in America is not covering American AIDS very much. They're covering African AIDS as if somehow miraculously it's all stopped here. Well, it hasn't, and the one thing they're not saying about Africa is that all those people are going to die; there's no way these people can be saved - none.","George Washington and Abraham Lincoln were gay, just for starters. They didn't have a name for it, but their primary affections and intellectual attractions were all for other men.","Most of the Michelle Bachmanns and Mitt Romneys who say such terrible things about us actually is a positive force, because it allows sensible people to realize how stupid and vile their beliefs are.","Writers who are activists are very rarely taken seriously as artists.","Gay life in 1970 was very bleak, compartmentalized. You didn't take it to work. You had to really lead a double life. There were bars, but you sort of snuck in and snuck out. Activism and gay pride simply didn't exist. I don't even think the word 'gay' was in existence.","I think Ed Koch is the person most responsible for allowing AIDS to get out of control. It happened here first, on his watch. If he had done what any moral human being should have done in the beginning, and put out alarms, then a lot fewer people would have gotten sick.","We're still leaderless. We still don't have strong organizations that are fighting for us; there isn't a national AIDS organization out there worth squat in my opinion.","Mr. Do-Nothing Obama will say today, 'Lets think of all the poor dead people' - or 'let's honor all the dead' instead of fighting for the living. He has been really useless in terms of both HIV and gay issues. He is simply not a leader. He may be president, but he is not a leader.","Some reporter called me 'the angriest gay man in the world' or some such. Well, it stuck, but I realized it was very useful.","By nature, I'm an optimistic person. No one believes it, but I am.","I came from Yale, where you get an extracurricular degree in self-importance because you went there. When AIDS happened, I was treated like an outcast. And I don't like that feeling.","I think being gay and gay people are the most wonderful things in the world. I wish all of us could have the power and pride to benefit from what is rightfully ours. Why isn't there an enormous building in Washington called the 'National Association of Lesbian and Gay Concerns' to lobby for us?","Activism is very seductive, and writing is painful and hard. It's very scary to have a death threat living over your head. Activism is very sustaining. But I don't view myself as a political person. I'm just someone who desperately wants to stay alive.","I forgot that San Francisco is not an angry city like New York. Gays have gotten what they wanted there over the years, unlike New York, where we had to fight for everything."],"Larry MacPhail":["I should contribute generously to the war chest of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. But, I do not contribute at all.","Day baseball is now dead for all practical purposes. Sooner or later, the game will be played in its entirety at night, and as I've said before, then baseball will be squarely in the amusement, the entertainment business along with wrestling, midget auto racing and the trotting tracks.","I decided that I wanted a farm back in 1940 when I was with the Dodgers. I tried to find one within commuting distance of New York.","It had been my idea that a combination of purebred cattle and horses could be successful from an economic standpoint - in Maryland. Maryland is not a cattle state. To raise beef cattle successfully, you've got to be able to raise cheap feed.","The only way you can obtain brood mares on a basis you can afford is to buy two or three yearling fillies every year and race them. The good ones, the ones that show potentialities, you keep, and the others you get rid of. In that way, you have a chance to build up a good brood mare band.","The danger in a brood mare band is that your mares become antiquated, and you wake up some day and realize that the average age of your band is 15 or 16 and that in another year they won't be producing offspring. I think the ideal average age for a brood mare band is about 10.","When I was a kid in Michigan, I used to play ball with a town team on Sunday. Of course, I'd go to church first. Played the church organ, as a matter of fact.","The big tragedy in baseball is that the amateur spirit has gone out of it to a large extent."],"Larry McMurtry":["True maturity is only reached when a man realizes he has become a father figure to his girlfriends' boyfriends - and he accepts it.","No illusion is more crucial than the illusion that great success and huge money buy you immunity from the common ills of mankind, such as cars that won't start.","Members of the Academy are mostly urban people. We are an urban nation. We are not a rural nation. It's not easy even to get a rural story made.","Incompetents invariably make trouble for people other than themselves.","You expect far too much of a first sentence. Think of it as analogous to a good country breakfast: what we want is something simple, but nourishing to the imagination.","A man that ain't willin' to cheat for a poke don't want it bad enough.","Self-parody is the first portent of age.","Americans don't want cowboys to be gay.","Backward is just not a natural direction for Americans to look - historical ignorance remains a national characteristic.","If we know anything about man, it's that he's not pacific. The temptation to butcher anyone considered undesirable seems to be a common temptation, not always resisted.","One of the things that Ang brings to all of his projects is his deep sense of being a double exile, an outsider's outsider."],"Larry Merchant":["Too much youth, hunger, mission, and talent.","Follow the wisdom of the great actor, James Cagney, you hit your mark, you look the other guy in the eye, and you tell the truth."],"Larry Miller":["Women say they have sexual thoughts too. They have no idea. It's the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing it. If they knew what we were really thinking, they'd never stop slapping us.","I was asleep, in the upstairs bedroom, in the rear of the house. There was this tremendous crash, there was a terrible wind force hitting my body, and then I blanked out.","Manufacturers are making products kosher to get in on that market, plus more people are looking for kosher."],"Larry Mullen, Jr.":["I've always had an interest in doing something that was outside my comfort zone; I had this thing about standing on the edge of the cliff and deciding to jump.","I'm not a violent person, but I've got a hard core streak and have a reputation about living dangerously.","Companies like Spotify, the new Apple service, and all the others are really going to have to pay artists more. And I think it's a matter of time; I think a lot of these companies and the individuals that are involved in them realize that as well. They know that artists are not getting what they should be getting.","In the music world, ageism is a big issue. It's about youth and youth culture. There's no other art form that I know that requires you to be a certain age.","When you're in the music business, everything is very personal, because you are invested in everything; there's a very deep, personal attachment to your music.","I have had an amazing career for a man who hits things for a living.","It's a tough life being a pop star. You know, at the end of the day when you've paid all the bills and put the kids through college and that, you know, there's only enough left for a small island off the South Pacific.","I joined a band to hit things.","I don't know what I'm qualified to do, film-wise... So it's really down to a director or a casting director to find something that they think I could do.","I was in Cannes two years ago at our 'U23D' movie premiere. I love the French.","The big issue with rock stars becoming actors is that sometimes it's not believable, and vice versa with actors becoming rock stars. Sometimes just doesn't fit.","Relevance, for me, is about being creative and doing things that you believe in, whether that's music or acting or painting a picture, or whatever that is.","I will never be a career actor, I don't think. I don't feel that I have the skill set to jump into it that way, although I wouldn't mind giving it a try.","Tony Blair is a war criminal, and I think he should be tried as a war criminal. Then I see Bono and him as pals, and I'm going, 'I don't like that.' Do I think George Bush is a war criminal? Probably - but the difference between him and Tony Blair is that Blair is intelligent. So, he has no excuse.","We need to be creative, on the cutting edge, challenged, and it's really hard going. It's relentless, and we're relentless, and we have a history of breaking engineers, producers. I mean, people come out of working with U2 and just go, 'I just don't know what's happened; it feels like a lifetime has passed by.' And that's just the way we work."],"Larry Niven":["Everything starts as somebody's daydream.","Building one space station for everyone was and is insane: we should have built a dozen.","I do not believe they've run out of surprises.","Treat your life like something to be sculpted.","The human species really could have faced global thermonuclear war. During seventy years of Cold War we grew used to it.","We're looking as far ahead as we can, and we don't get penalized for mistakes.","We need to take command of the solar system to gain that wealth, and to escape the sea of paper our government is becoming, and for some decent chance of stopping a Dinosaur Killer asteroid.","Anything beats an expensive stack of paper.","I love superconductors.","I'm not predicting; I just love playing with superconductors.","We should not have assumed that a political space station could be built.","In general, I don't know when inspiration will pop up.","I've got five or six unpublished stories kicking around looking for somebody to buy them.","My problem with new writers is that it takes me five or six years to memorise the right names.","Bruce Sterling is one terrific writer and he's relatively new, but I don't know how long he's been doing it; he probably doesn't need the publicity anymore!","SF isn't a genre; SF is the matrix in which genres are embedded, and because the SF field is never going in any one direction at any one time, there is hardly a way to cut it off.","As for AIDS, it's a plague. We are human, we get plagues. They come along every so often, kill off two thirds of the population; in the next generation it's a quarter; after that it's a childhood disease.","I don't have a strong interest in history.","I'd visit the near future, close enough that someone might want to talk to Larry Niven and can figure out the language; distant enough to get me decent medical techniques and a ticket to the Moon.","I never got good at predicting what millions of people will suddenly decide is rational.","I do suspect that privacy was a passing fad.","I'd repair our education system or replace it with something that works.","I've spent a lot of my life among people brighter than myself.","But... watching Steven Barnes taught me to treat my life like an art form.","And every friend I've got has been writing Mars stories. It was pretty clear I'd never catch up.","In hindsight it may even seem inevitable that a socialist society will starve when it runs out of capitalists.","The dinosaurs became extinct because they didn't have a space program."],"Larry Norman":["I'm fishing for men with a certain kind of bait, and the bait that I am offering is not a candy; it's a very specific thing that I'm offering, which is a deep gospel and a deep conversion.","We need worship for our spirit, fellowship for our soul and committed subservience for our body.","Life is God's art.","I want to encourage other people to try to discover who they are, not to try to fit into some superficial prototype of what they think a Christian should be, but to discover who they really are.","Art is more engaging that propaganda.","Jesus got me through the slums without getting murdered. I just walked with him as though he were really there and not a spirit just floating around.","Gospel songs to me are about the mansion in the sky, and washed in the blood of Christ's crimson blood, songs that are filled with biblical wording that's no longer understood by a lot of people.","I know I stand visibly onstage, but my function is still unseen, because I rarely see the immediate results of what I am saying or doing or writing.","I'm only here on Earth to serve God. I never had a career. I don't care about commercialism. I have a ministry and I'll fight for the ministry.","I feel that Christian music is a subculture directed towards the Christians. It's not really being exposed to non-Christians and it's not really created for non-Christians, so non-Christians almost never hear any of this music.","Only in a concert situation do I have access to people directly to preach to them, and I don't believe that the bigger your platform is, the more people will pay attention."],"Larry Page":["If you're changing the world, you're working on important things. You're excited to get up in the morning.","For me, privacy and security are really important. We think about it in terms of both: You can't have privacy without security.","I have always believed that technology should do the hard work - discovery, organization, communication - so users can do what makes them happiest: living and loving, not messing with annoying computers! That means making our products work together seamlessly.","If we were motivated by money, we would have sold the company a long time ago and ended up on a beach.","My job as a leader is to make sure everybody in the company has great opportunities, and that they feel they're having a meaningful impact and are contributing to the good of society. As a world, we're doing a better job of that. My goal is for Google to lead, not follow that.","Lots of companies don't succeed over time. What do they fundamentally do wrong? They usually miss the future.","You may think using Google's great, but I still think it's terrible.","I do think there is an important artistic component in what we do. As a technology company I've tried to really stress that.","Many leaders of big organizations, I think, don't believe that change is possible. But if you look at history, things do change, and if your business is static, you're likely to have issues.","We have a mantra: don't be evil, which is to do the best things we know how for our users, for our customers, for everyone. So I think if we were known for that, it would be a wonderful thing.","Especially in technology, we need revolutionary change, not incremental change.","Invention is not enough. Tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. You have to combine both things: invention and innovation focus, plus the company that can commercialize things and get them to people.","Basically, our goal is to organize the world's information and to make it universally accessible and useful.","You know what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream? And you know that if you don't have a pencil and pad by the bed, it will be completely gone by the next morning. Sometimes it's important to wake up and stop dreaming. When a really great dream shows up, grab it.","We're at maybe 1% of what is possible. Despite the faster change, we're still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. I think a lot of that is because of the negativity... Every story I read is Google vs someone else. That's boring. We should be focusing on building the things that don't exist.","I think it is often easier to make progress on mega-ambitious dreams. Since no one else is crazy enough to do it, you have little competition. In fact, there are so few people this crazy that I feel like I know them all by first name.","My grandfather was an autoworker, and I have a weapon he manufactured to protect himself from the company that he would carry to work. It's a big iron pipe with a hunk of lead on the head. I think about how far we've come as companies from those days, where workers had to protect themselves from the company.","If you ask an economist what's driven economic growth, it's been major advances in things that mattered - the mechanization of farming, mass manufacturing, things like that. The problem is, our society is not organized around doing that.","We want to build technology that everybody loves using, and that affects everyone. We want to create beautiful, intuitive services and technologies that are so incredibly useful that people use them twice a day. Like they use a toothbrush. There aren't that many things people use twice a day.","It really matters whether people are working on generating clean energy or improving transportation or making the Internet work better and all those things. And small groups of people can have a really huge impact.","The ultimate search engine would basically understand everything in the world, and it would always give you the right thing. And we're a long, long ways from that.","If your access to health care involves your leaving work and driving somewhere and parking and waiting for a long time, that's not going to promote healthiness.","I have over 2 million followers now on Google Plus.","We can't have democracy if we're having to protect you and our users from the government over stuff we've never had a conversation about. We need to know what the parameters are, what kind of surveillance the government is going to do, and how and why.","The idea that everyone should slavishly work so they do something inefficiently so they keep their job - that just doesn't make any sense to me. That can't be the right answer.","You need to invent things and you need to get them to people. You need to commercialize those inventions. Obviously, the best way we've come up with doing that is through companies.","Big companies have always needed and cooperated in areas where it made sense.","Computing is kind of a mess. Your computer doesn't know where you are. It doesn't know what you're doing. It doesn't know what you know.","We don't have as many managers as we should, but we would rather have too few than too many.","It's quite complicated and sounds circular, but we've worked out a way of calculate a Web site's importance.","If you say you want to automate cars and save people's lives, the skills you need for that aren't taught in any particular discipline. I know - I was interested in working on automating cars when I was a Ph.D. student in 1995.","I really like using my Samsung (005930:KS) tablet. I previously used the Motorola Xoom for a while and liked that.","I can't really comment on rumors.","I like going to Burning Man, for example. An environment where people can try new things. I think as technologists we should have some safe places where we can try out new things and figure out the effect on society. What's the effect on people, without having to deploy it to the whole world.","Most people think companies are basically evil. They get a bad rap. And I think that's somewhat correct.","Over time, our emerging high-usage products will likely generate significant new revenue streams for Google as well as for our partners, just as search does today."],"Larry Poons":["There's something always instinctively visually right about nature. There's no difference, to my eye, between looking at a great painting and looking at nature. Because painting, when it's great, has the same immutable rightness, unquestioned rightness, about it.","A great painting is a great painting.","If you want to be told what to think, well, I'm not in that business.","There are people who don't respond to color. That's what painting is. It's color.","The only thing simple about the past is that it's not now.","If you think you know where you're going to be 10 years from now, that's where you're at now. You're just putting it off."],"Larry Rivers":["I guess I've always liked the idea of being an artist.","I believe that any art communicates what you're in the mood to receive.","Any art communicates what you're in the mood to receive.","I spent seven months in Africa and came back saying there isn't anything you can say about black people that you couldn't say about, say, pink people except that they're black."],"Larry Smith":["Find and use your passion, and you'll have a great career. Don't do it, you won't. It's as simple as that.","If you've never tasted what it's like to get up in the morning and be pleased to go to work, you don't know what you're missing.","Just because you're passionately interested in something doesn't mean it has to be your career. You might have to look for more than one passion. Some passions may afford a career and some may not.","We live in a world where people think that finding a passion is so rare that if you find one you're the luckiest person on the planet, and the possibility of finding two is just bizarre. It isn't. We have multiple passions."],"Larry Speakes":["You don't tell us how to stage the news and we don't tell you how to cover it.","Those who talk don't know what is going on and those who know what is going on won't talk.","Being a press secretary is like learning to type: You're hunting and pecking for a while and then you find yourself doing the touch system and don't realize it. You're speaking for the president without ever having to go to him.","I would dodge, not lie, in the national interest."],"Larry Wall":["Younger hackers are hard to classify. They're probably just as diverse as the old hackers are. We're all over the map.","The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris.","I think computer science, by and large, is still stuck in the Modern age.","Real programmers can write assembly code in any language.","For me, writing is a love-hate relationship.","Doing linear scans over an associative array is like trying to club someone to death with a loaded Uzi.","The Harvard Law states: Under controlled conditions of light, temperature, humidity, and nutrition, the organism will do as it damn well pleases.","We are so Post-Modern that we don't realize how Post-Modern we are anymore.","Perl was designed to work more like a natural language. It's a little more complicated but there are more shortcuts, and once you learned the language, it's more expressive.","Hubris itself will not let you be an artist.","I am not a sort of person who wants to run a company.","I still drive my 1977 Honda Accord. The paint is almost all worn off. It's still running.","I take time to watch anime. I don't know whether I'm allowed to, but I do it anyway.","I talked about becoming stupid, but I've always been stupid. Fortunately I've been just smart enough to realize that I'm stupid.","I think operating systems work best if they're free and open. Particular applications are more likely to be proprietary.","I think software patents are a bad idea. Many patents are given for trivial inventions.","I think the way IBM has embraced the open source philosophy has been quite astonishing, but gratifying. I hope they'll do very well with it.","I want people to use Perl. I want to be a positive ingredient of the world and make my American history. So, whatever it takes to give away my software and get it used, that's great.","I'm just paid to do whatever I want to do. Some of the time it's development, and some of the time it's just goofing off.","I'm never satisfied because I've been always interested in too many things and I always want to do everything at once.","If any ideology is so serious that you can't have fun while you're doing it, it's probably too serious.","If you're a large corporation, you can afford to pay the money to register patents, but if you're an individual like me, you can't.","Many days I don't write any code at all, and some days I spend all day writing code.","One of the very basic ideas of Post-Modernism is rejection of arbitrary power structures. Different people are sensitive to different kinds of power structures.","Post-Modernism was a reaction against Modernism. It came quite early to music and literature, and a little later to architecture. And I think it's still coming to computer science.","Programmers can be lazy.","Some of modern engineering is necessary to good art. But I think of myself is a cultural artist.","Somebody out there is going to do something that's far more surprising than anything that I would do. I was surprised by the whole web thing in the first place.","The problems that I really like to solve are our cultural problems.","The world has become a larger place. The universe has been expanding, and Perl's been expanding along with the universe.","There is no schedule. We are all volunteers, so we get it done when we get it done. Perl 5 still works fine, and we plan to take the right amount of time on Perl 6.","To be a good artist, you have to serve the work of art and allow it to be what it is supposed to be.","We all agree on the necessity of compromise. We just can't agree on when it's necessary to compromise.","When I announced the development of Perl 6, I said it was going to be a community design. I designed Perl, myself. It's limited by my own brain power. So I wanted Perl 6 to be a community design."],"Larry Wilcox":["Another thing I like to do is sit back and take in nature. To look at the birds, listen to their singing, go hiking, camping and jogging and running, walking along the beach, playing games and sometimes being alone with the great outdoors. It's very special to me.","Family is very important to me because that is the footprint we perpetuate. That is, the ripple in the water when the rock first impacts the pool, and it is those waves, that energy that one produces, that determines our direction.","I'm very candid.","I have a special interest in children who have lost a parent or loved one in the line of duty as they served their country as a police officer, firefighter, federal agent or member of the military, but children all over the word need help and an opportunity to flourish.","Life can be a bore if you're constantly walking sidewalks instead of a tightrope once in a while.","Dentistry was an ego trip, and acting is a personal need. Usually it's the reverse, and I honestly don't think I had the talent in my hands to be a good dentist.","I've always felt that children are the flowers of our future.","I have learned a great deal in my life, and DeMolay helped me to learn that character and integrity should be cornerstones in your life. As a Senior DeMolay, as a father, the best advice I could ever give would be to take the high road in life, and you will be able to build trusting relationships.","I don't mind talking about 'what might have been,' but I am not one to doubt or regret most of my decisions.","I owe the public a good performance, the best I can give. We really bust our chops on 'CHiPs' but when I go home and get a weekend off, I want to spend it quietly, with my lady.","It's like with a girl: it's more fun to meet and slowly, gradually learn things about each other. A little mystery is always nice and it's interesting to still learn new things about someone you are involved with.","The film business was a great lesson in business combat and what it takes to survive.","I was raised on a ranch in Wyoming, and I've been riding horses most of my life.","Exposing your ignorance is how you get somebody to embrace you.","I guess I'm just a frustrated cowboy.","I love to act, but business is more interesting because it's more competitive and involves more people. There's more 'now' mentality and energy. Intellectually, it's a lot more interesting.","Everyone in business is tenacious and extremely aggressive. If you're not a 'now' person - do it right now - then you're not going to be successful. I like that kind of mentality.","The literary aspect of the film business excites me, but show business in general doesn't take any mental giant.","A lot of people in film run around with a facade and use the right vocabulary and think they're mental giants, but it's very limiting.","I've been very selective in what I did and didn't do.","I learned a lesson that I don't ever want to be a CEO.","My goal would be to make Frank Capra-type films about real people, how they define their reality.","I just didn't realize how powerful 'CHiPs' was."],"Larry Williams":["The three traits speculators must learn to manage within themselves are confidence, fear, and aggressiveness.","Rock and Roll has no beginning and no end for it is the very pulse of life itself.","The next time you see an outside day with a down close lower than the previous day, don't get scared, get ready to buy!","What you will be looking for is a day that closes above the prior day's high and most likely 'breaks' out to the upside to close above a trading range. This is the twitching worm that causes the public to leap before they look.","It's our job as economic developers in the state to make sure any prospect receives all available incentives.","One out of three jobs in Washington is tied to trade."],"Larry Wilmore":["I have this rule. It's called 'Top Dog-Underdog:' Underdog gets to make fun of Top Dog, but Top Dog can't make fun of Underdog. But you know what? You get Top Dog, you get to be Top Dog. Congratulations! And that dynamic happens not just in race but in many different ways. It's like the male-female dynamic.","I have a free voice. I have a free mind. I have freedom of expression.","Maybe I'll write an episode of 'Black-ish' about a guy being fired in late-night.","Salt Lake City gave me a lot of surprises. How progressive the city actually is, for instance, compared to the rest of Utah - it's like this purple dot in a sea of red. And the government there is kind of a mix of conservative values and progressive ideas.","My father was in law enforcement growing up. He was a probation officer. And I've always understood the point of view of the peace officer, you know, because of my dad.","I didn't even know how much of a feminist I was, and I realized, 'Oh my God, I was raised by a single mom who had to raise six kids. I have three sisters. Larry, you've been a feminist your whole life, and you really didn't know it until you've been presented with these issues.'","All writers have a love-hate relationship with writing. Performing is fun, too, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite. But the most fulfilling is producing.","In my career, I'm always trying to do something different.","When you're taking chances, you know it's not going to please everybody.","I always said I'm not disappointed with Obama because I voted for him because he was black, and as long as he kept being black, I was a happy man.","You have to stay alert. You've got to keep raising your game.","I'll stop talking about race when people stop being racist.","When you have somebody like a Donald Trump - he made no bones about trying to disprove Barack Obama's Americanism in trying to make him out to be some foreigner that was born in Kenya. I thought that to be very racist.","The first show I worked on was 'In Living Color.' I think 'The Daily Show' was the culmination of having that point of view - being able to look at this third rail in our society.","Sometimes I'd say what's bad for the country is good for my business, unfortunately.","I would consider myself more a passionate centrist.","Doing a TV show is different because it's more of a TV version of something. A more focused take on things.","It's a challenge to do satire when the thing you're satirizing is almost beyond satire, but I think that's a challenge for everybody.","I really enjoyed being able to be one of the people who weighed in on the events. As hard as it is to do that every day, because it is exhausting, it really is fun to do that, especially when you feel like you really did something well, and it really hit.","As a culture, we've all agreed with the opinion that the world should be seen in a certain way, so at 'The Nightly Show,' our chief mission was to disagree with that premise. And to see the world in a way that may not make everybody comfortable. And to present it with a cast of people who don't always get to have a voice on that.","One of the missions of 'The Nightly Show' was to have a conversation with America in a sense, and talk about the things that people didn't want to talk about it.","I'm not the type of person to have a schadenfreude.","I don't take pleasure in anyone's demise, really.","The business part of it can be very vexing. You always have to keep certain metrics and everything. Because all I can do is make a good show.","Many times, when you do what I do or work in journalism in general, people try to not explicitly present their opinions on topics.","I think the term 'fair reporting' is overused when it comes to journalism. I think saying they want to report evenly is more accurate.","Sometimes I'm successful, and sometimes I'm not, but I don't mind going down trying.","I guess I hadn't counted on 'The Unblackening' happening to my time slot as well.","When you use the word 'fair' in television, you're already in a fantasy world. Nothing is really fair in television.","In my time, I experienced a black man not being able to be the quarterback of a football team.","I am from Pomona, California. I was born in Los Angeles.","My parents are from the Midwest. They're from Evanston, Illinois. They moved out to Los Angeles right before I was born.","My father had a lot of allergies, and he just didn't like the cold of Chicago, and his father - his parents had broken up when he was young, and his father had lived in Pasadena for a while, and he kind of fell in love with Southern California.","A lot of my family on both sides have worked in education and nursing, and my grandmother was a nurse; my sister is a nurse, and her - my other sister's daughter is going into nursing. There's a lot of that in the family.","I thought Sarah Palin was the ultimate expression of comic outrageousness in a person.","Whenever I did sitcoms, that always happened on your show. Once the show was on the air, it takes on a life of its own. It develops, and it becomes something else.","If you look at somebody like Sam Bee, she got to create her own thing without any expectations that there was a show there. That was probably liberating for them.","I'm not trying to prove anything for the right or the left. Which gives me freedom to make jokes about either side, too.","I'm too tired most of the time. Why do I have to take a stand on everything? Sometimes, I'm just not mad at it.","I just believe what I believe.","There are tragedies that happen all the time in America, but there are certain types of tragedies that kind of pull us together and make us pause and give us a chance to reflect about where we are, where we're going, and that sort of thing.","Police have to have one of the most difficult jobs in society today. But at the same time, I think, a person in that position - their responsibility has to be high as well.","I'm not a homosexual, but if I can be an ally for that issue, I think it's fantastic.","'The Daily Show,' at its core, is the answer to the nightly news.","I always compartmentalized so many different things.","I was an athlete, so I hung out with the jocks. I was smart, so I hung out with the nerdy kids. I was also into theater, so I hung out with the misfits... So I was always in different groups, and those groups never quite overlapped. The racial part of it was just another one of those groups, in one sense.","I don't have that kind of Southern experience of the fire-and-brimstone preacher type of thing. Certainly not in my comedy.","It used to be that the black comic figure had to have this bravado and always showed strength.","The fact that we live in a world where black people have to strategize so they're not brutalized by police is insane.","It was the Cosby issue that made me realize how much I really cared about women's issues and how much I realize it's important for me to be an advocate for issues that aren't necessarily my own, to be an ally for issues.","I'm not going to grouse and complain when there's nothing I can do about it. Once you've broken up with somebody, arguing with them is not going to bring them back. You may want to stop their Twitter account or call them up late at night, but they made the decision to leave.","People aren't autonomous creatures. They're under a lot of pressure themselves.","It's really not my thing to go after what comedians are doing. Because I always feel like we're jesters at the end of the day.","I'd rather go after the people who are the guardians or what we're doing - the news people and the politicians and that sort of thing. I always feel like those should be my targets, not really entertainers. That's just my personal opinion.","You are always, always overwhelmed by positive response because you know it can go either way.","'Westworld' is bizarre. I don't know what to think of 'Westworld.'","I think the biggest thing is voice. Whose voice is it? Who gets to control the narrative?","We will see about Obama's legacy. I still think the historical nature of his candidacy will be the biggest part of his legacy.","My joke is that three black people watch 'The Daily Show' at any given time. So if I'm watching it, that counts, and there's only two left. It's a silly joke, but you know, different types of comedy reach different cultures.","I get recognized by some people in my community, but not a lot. In fact, they would say, 'What do you do?' And I would say, 'Well, I did 'The Bernie Mac Show.'' And they would say, 'Oh, really? Well, do you know so-and-so?' And I'd say, 'Yeah, I hired them. I was the boss!' They don't believe it.","I like 'The Nightly Show.' People ask me what it is, and I say, 'If you're watching 'The Daily Show,' and it feels like it's getting a little darker, you're probably watching 'The Nightly Show.''","I really love having conversations and deconstructing things. I don't mind not having a laugh every second. Sometimes things deserve a little more discussion, and then you can have some fun after that.","The last thing I would ever do is try to become a network programmer.","I didn't get into comedy to talk about violent death all the time.","The thing that's worked for me is having as much of a connection to the material as possible. And sometimes the material requires a more straightforward approach, and sometimes it requires a little more silliness, you know?","We had a segment called Tampon Tuesdays that I was very proud of; that was hilarious because there are a lot of women's issues out there that a lot of people don't know about because they're not women, and they don't have to go through them.","I set out to have a diverse staff on the 'Bernie Mac Show.'","I've always watched the political shows.","Writing is the most frustrating, but it's something that I've always done.","I'd love to set up shop somewhere and develop projects - film, TV, digital would be a fun thing to do.","I really love storytelling.","I'm actually a big fan of having all the different types of voices on television. I think it gives people a nice little buffet that they can just pick and choose how they want to get their news and entertainment, I guess.","Remember, MTV would only show white videos for a long time. Can you imagine that? That was the '80s when that happened. It's hard to even think of that now, you know?","I just feel it's important to make sure that behind the scenes is as filled with diverse voices as in front of the scene is.","I love the word 'dearth,' by the way. It's one of my favorite words.","When you work in television, you're in the writer's room all the time.","Even though you're in charge, you're not completely in ownership. You know, the audience takes a huge ownership of your show. Look at comments about shows and tell me if I'm wrong. Look at shows like 'The Walking Dead' and the ownership that the audience has of that show.","Not everybody's gonna get your vision.","Every television show is sentenced to death - time and date of execution unknown.","You never know in TV - sometimes you're on at the wrong time at the wrong place. Sometimes you don't get a chance to catch on.","I do not look to Hollywood to give me character clues.","As long as you say I'm the guy who's real about it, I have no problem being the person who people look to to talk about race.","Richard Pryor was my hero. Richard Pryor was keeping it 100.","I've pitched many things that have not gone, but every year, I'm in that pilot game like a lot of other writers in Hollywood.","MSNBC got rid of so many black people, I thought Boko Haram was running that network.","There's something about a new family moving into the White House that's kind of interesting, even if you didn't vote for them.","Some things are so tragic that you don't know what's funny in it, and some things are so ridiculous you don't know if it's worth talking about it.","I was taught from a very early age that I had to work twice as hard to get half as much. That was the world I grew up in - a very strong work ethic.","Any voting group has an interest that they want from politicians. That's why politicians have to talk to different people. But to reduce the black interest to free stuff is so insulting. It just makes me apoplectic.","My white counterparts are always pushing the line, and they are fearless, so why can't I do that, too?","I don't think I ever intend to provoke outrage, but I don't mind being provocative in content.","You never want to defend a joke. People get to choose whether or not to laugh and whether or not they think something is funny.","When most people become president, even if you disagree with their ideology, you can still agree that they would have the competence to run something... With Trump, I do not have the confidence of that at all.","I'm not really a self-promoter-type person.","I really don't have a need to be on TV all that much, to be honest with you.","No matter what his crimes were, Alton Sterling did not deserve to be executed for them. Look, guys, the punishment for resisting arrest shouldn't be death. The punishment for selling bootleg CDs shouldn't be death. The punishment for having a gun in an open-carry state shouldn't be death. The punishment for being a black man shouldn't be death.","I'm understated in my approach.","I have a lot of passion for a lot of different things."],"Larry the Cable Guy":["I think probably one of the coolest things was when I went to play basketball at Rucker Park in Harlem. First of all, who would think that Larry the Cable Guy would go to Harlem to play basketball? And I was received like a rock star. It was amazing! There were people everywhere. There were guys walking by yelling, 'Git 'r done!'","I was always a fan of the old-style comics. I loved vaudeville. I loved Milton Berle, Dick Shawn, Phyllis Diller, Don Rickles, Charlie Callas, all those guys. Hilarious. I love the Bing Crosby and Bob Hope movies, and Abbott & Costello. My television influences were 'Monty Python's Flying Circus,' 'Benny Hill,' and 'Hee Haw.'","It's nice if people can finally loosen up a little bit and just go out laugh at silliness. I mean, people take themselves way too seriously sometimes.","I don't judge people by their accent, or how they word things, or how grammatically correct their speech is. Some of the smartest men in the world couldn't spell. I judge a person by their character.","I'm so sick of gay this, gay that. I could care less. It ain't affecting my life at all.","What a piece of garbage this smart car is. There's a commercial - the smart car has zero percent interest for six years. Well, good, I got zero percent in six years in buying this smart car. I'll tell you that much. I mean, it's ridiculous. My buddy has a smart car, totaled it. He hit a deer tick.","I'm saying, Come on, the global warming thing? How did the ice melt during the ice ages? Was the dinosaurs driving SUVs around back then?","What I do onstage, there's maybe .0001 percent of the population that acts like that. I talk like that because it makes me laugh, and because I know a couple of people that talk like that. They're really that Southern. And they do funny things. I love 'em; they're awesome. They're good people.","I saw a sign one time that said 'hemorrhoids awareness week' at the doctor's office. Let me tell you, if you got hemorrhoids, I'm sure you are aware of it. You don't need a sign to tell anybody about it.","I've never judged anybody by how they look or how they dress. I basically judge them on their character. And that's how I lead my own life.","Every July, I look forward to taping a Christmas show - in July in Nashville. In 98-degree weather. I love it.","I've always felt that if you've been blessed, you should try to help as many people as you can. I just think that's the right thing to do.","Tony Orlando is one of the nicest guys I have ever met - bar none - in my entire life. I was always a fan when I was a kid - you know, huge fan. Who wasn't a fan of Tony Orlando?","One of my little girls is named Reagan. Her first words were, 'Mr. Larry, tear down this crib.' That was her first words, it was very sweet. My first words were, 'Are you going to finish that sandwich?'","I don't even see it as cable TV anymore. I've been called 'Larry the Cable Guy' for so long, I don't even think about it being about cable. I don't know anything about cable.","'Cars' has been a godsend. I mean, I get paid to talk into a mic. Honestly, I had no idea it would become as big as it did. When I first got the part of Mater, it was actually a small part. I did the voicing for it, though, and the animators liked it so much they rewrote the original script so that Mater could be in it more.","Our whole wedding cost 180 bucks. Afterward, we re-heated lasagna for everyone and set off fireworks.","I've only been to these foreign countries: Canada, L.A. and Miami.","The only reason I'm ever in character as 'Larry The Cable Guy' is because that's what I'm hired to do. In my movies, obviously they hired 'Larry The Cable Guy' to be 'Larry The Cable Guy.' When I do my shows, I'm 'Larry The Cable Guy.' When I do Jay Leno, it's: 'Please welcome 'Larry The Cable Guy.'","We try to make the name longer and longer every year. First, it was 'Larry the Cable Guy's Christmas Spectacular.' Then it was 'It's a Very Larry Christmas.' Now it's 'Larry the Cable Guy's Hula-palooza Christmas Luau.' I'll tell you what it is: It's funny. That's what it is. Who cares what the name of it is? It is a funny special.","I'm not a party guy, and I'm not a Hollywood guy, either.","I'm a huge NASCAR fan, but I'm not a gearhead. I've never been into fixing cars. It's not because I don't like it. I would love to know more. It's just my dad never taught me that stuff because my dad wasn't a mechanic.","I don't really get to see a lot of other comedians, because I work with the same people all the time. The guy I really like is Nick DiPaulo. I love Nick DiPaulo, but again, he's a buddy of mine. But I liked him for a long time. I liked him before he was a buddy of mine.","Doing a kid's movie is fun when you have kids. You don't want to do kids' movies if you don't have kids. When you have kids, things change in your life.","When Pixar calls and says, 'Hey, you wanna be in a Pixar movie?' you don't do a lot of contemplating!","Even before I did stand-up, I've always been the kind of guy - and I talk about it on stage - who says I like people and I always look for the good in people. I say, 'Every person has something good about them, if you can just find it.'","The thing that's changed the way I do my stand-up act is having kids and getting older and wiser and smarter. There might be a joke or two in the past that I wish I hadn't done, but in the past, you can't have it back.","I just developed my act way back in the late '80s. I went to college in Georgia, so I picked up the Southern accent. I talked like that with my friends all the time, because it was fun. It was funny... All my friends were real Southern. We're buddies, so I'd say stuff to make them laugh. So that was pretty much it.","As a comedian, I don't know if they're laughing because it's funny or if they're laughing at me because I'm not funny. And I'm thinking, 'Who cares? They're laughing.' If you go on stage, and they're laughing at you full-on for 60 minutes? You know, whatever puts them in the seats.","I love food: biscuits and gravy, cheese grits, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken-fried steak with white gravy... but my favorite dish is my wife's beanie weenie cornbread casserole. It's so good. It sounds stupid, but if you eat it, it's heaven. Of course, it's only something you can eat if you've got a lot of money.","We're homebodies. I've gotten to see my kids' first steps, first smiles, first words. Every day is a weekend."],"Lars Feld":["Fiscal decentralisation does not lead to higher economic growth because economic growth is much more driven by factors other than taxes and spending, e.g. increases in technological progress and improved human capital.","Central banks need to be able to buy bonds if there are short-term malfunctions of the markets. But buying bonds without differentiation and without limits would be very problematic."],"Lars Larsen":["To get a good deal, I buy them all with a friend. The houses, the boat, everything. We each buy half. So I pay half price! They get used more.","I had $20,000, and I started up JYSK.","I never think in terms of gold, currency, diamonds. I'm not clever enough for that.","I will sell all other things before JYSK. That's my baby, and you don't sell your baby.","Actona is a healthy company with strong values, very competent management and a solid organisation."],"Lars Mikkelsen":["Here in Denmark, you can easily just be left alone. This is my 'hood, and people leave me alone; it's nice.","I didn't really understand what you did when you went in front of the camera. And then suddenly I just understood it. When you're in a play, you carry the story, but you don't have to do that in film.","Denmark is, like, the flattest country on Earth.","I think you could find some waves on the west side of Denmark, but I never tried it.","Language is fun; it's fun to try.","I was in the military, and then I went to university to study biology.","I had to spend a few years learning how to do movies. I wasn't really good at that. I was a theatre actor first and foremost. So I took my time learning that.","I would be the worst biologist in the world!"],"Lars Onsager":["I have received the greatest honor in my life - and the greatest surprise. Never did I dream that the Nobel Prize could be awarded for the reciprocal relations.","The thermodynamic properties of electrolyte solutions can be determined from the measurements of the voltage between electrodes reversible to both ions.","Estimates of the ionic mobilities vary over a considerable range; but in any event, the positive ionic defect is much more mobile in the solid than in the liquid, and its mobility varies very little with the temperature."],"Lars Peter Hansen":["I work on the boundary between economics and statistics in this field called econometrics. Part of my interest is understanding how you use statistics in productive ways to analyze dynamic economic models.","There is a big divergence between views on a variety of policy issues from fiscal stimulus to financial regulation. It's my hope and my ambition for the economics profession that as we advance our knowledge, that those discussions will narrow in their focus, and that it will help to have more prudent policy-making down the road.","I think the understanding of the role of markets has really helped advance the values of entrepreneurship. It's helped shape public policy discussions in a whole variety of ways.","If you simply announce that things are irrational, then that alone doesn't get you very far. You have to replace rational agents with some concrete notion of what it means to be irrational.","I view the work I've done related to statistics and economics as, roughly speaking, how to do something without having to do everything.","Early on, in discussions of financial oversight, people would say, 'Well, this is a very complicated problem, therefore it requires a complicated solution.' And at that step, I would say, 'Well, wait a minute. Just because it's a complicated problem doesn't mean the best course of action immediately is one that's complicated.'","A lot of my colleagues have been people with broad interests in economics, not just narrowly focused interests.","It's kind of a funny way to put it, but if you want to study a dynamic economic system, what you'd like to be able to do is focus on the linkages, say, between asset markets and the macro economy without having to model everything at the same time."],"Lars Ulrich":["If there was no Black Sabbath, I could still possibly be a morning newspaper delivery boy. No fun.","Our music comes from our hearts - and it always has.","Napster hijacked our music without asking. They never sought our permission. Our catalog of music simply became available as free downloads on the Napster system.","One of my few shortcomings is that I can't predict the future.","I'm just sittin here trying not to be unhappy.","What's the message in Metallica? There is no message, but if there was a message, it really should be look within yourself, don't listen to me, don't listen to James, don't listen to anybody, look within yourself for the answers.","Everytime we put a record out, we lose people that can't deal with the growth.","Some people try and tell you what the songs are about and it bores me to death.","As long as it says Metallica on the record it's Metallica.","The only band that we have never played with but have always wanted to is the Rolling Stones."],"Lars von Trier":["Basically, I'm afraid of everything in life, except filmmaking.","If one devalues rationality, the world tends to fall apart.","You could say that when you introduce humour to your work, you also step back a little from it. You create a distance.","Political correctness kills discussion.","If you want to provoke, you should provoke someone who is stronger than you, otherwise you are misusing your power.","I had an almost fetishistic attraction to film technology.","I grew up in a culturally radical home, where strong emotions were forbidden.","My films are about ideals that clash with the world. Every time it's a man in the lead, they have forgotten about the ideals. And every time it's a woman in the lead, they take the ideals all the way.","When I show a film at a festival, I am showing myself. Everything is at stake for me.","Actors need bricks to play with, and in fact we rejected all the improvised fragments we had made without a plan. Improvisation without a plan is like tennis without tennis balls.","I'm happy that I'm alive. I feel like someone coming back from Vietnam, you know; I'm sure that later on I'll start killing people in a square somewhere, but right now, I just feel happy to be alive.","You know, I really do have some morals. I do actually care about people. And I do have a political standpoint.","I know that I cannot be with a person for three hours without saying at least ten things that would kill me.","I sit there pouring out my woes year after year, coming up with one enormity after another about my mother and the way she let me down; but it doesn't make me any the less fearful.","Far be it from me to force anyone into either chess or dressage, but if you choose to do so yourself, in my opinion there is only one way: follow the rules.","That's the great thing about entering a convent: There are things that you simply can't do, so you don't have to worry about them.","When I was younger, I was fascinated by David Bowie, for example. he had created an entire myth around himself. It was as important as his music.","When I was in film school, it was said that all good films were characterised by some form of humour.","Only a fool does not fear actors, but you can't beat them, and if you can't beat them, join them, as they say. As I've got older I've become very interested in that part of the work.","If I made a musical in the beginning of my career, it would have been crane shots and tracking shots and people coming out of cakes and whatever, but these techniques are something that I've left behind me.","It's always been a lie that it's difficult to make films.","I always do something that I've never done before.","I think it's important that we all try to give something to this medium, instead of just thinking about what is the most efficient way of telling a story or making an audience stay in a cinema.","I'm having a vacation, and it's so beautiful, and maybe I'll never get another film idea in my life.","More than anything, there are more images in evil. Evil is based far more on the visual, whereas good has no good images at all.","I would say that I am a poor Christian; I'm not a believer. It was this idea very early in my life that life on Earth, nature or man could not be a creation of a merciful God.","I am not very tough with raising my children, but you can argue that to be more tough will help your children."],"Lascelles Abercrombie":["There is only one thing which can master the perplexed stuff of epic material into unity; and that is, an ability to see in particular human experience some significant symbolism of man's general destiny.","Epic poetry exhibits life in some great symbolic attitude. It cannot strictly be said to symbolize life itself, but always some manner of life.","The first epics were intended for recitation; the literary epic is meant to be read.","Traditional matter must be glorified, since it would be easier to listen to the re-creation of familiar stories than to quite new and unexpected things; the listeners, we must remember, needed poetry chiefly as the re-creation of tired hours.","For the stage displays the first vigorous expression, as the natural thing and without conspicuous restraint, of private individuality.","An epic is not made by piecing together a set of heroic lays, adjusting their discrepancies and making them into a continuous narrative.","But the development of human society does not go straight forward; and the epic process will therefore be a recurring process, the series a recurring series - though not in exact repetition.","But the gravest difficulty, and perhaps the most important, in poetry meant solely for recitation, is the difficulty of achieving verbal beauty, or rather of making verbal beauty tell.","By the general process of epic poetry, I mean the way this form of art has constantly responded to the profound needs of the society in which it was made.","If epic poetry is a definite species, the sagas do not fall within it.","It is more difficult to keep the attention of hearers than of readers.","It seems difficult, sometimes, to believe that there was a time when sentiments now become habitual, sentiments that imply not only the original imperative of conduct, but the original metaphysic of living, were by no means altogether habitual.","No poet will ever take the written word as a substitute for the spoken word; he knows that it is on the spoken word, and the spoken word only, that his art is founded.","Poetry is the work of poets, not of peoples or communities; artistic creation can never be anything but the production of an individual mind.","That is to say, epic poetry has been invented many times and independently; but, as the needs which prompted the invention have been broadly similar, so the invention itself has been.","The balance of private good and general welfare is at the bottom of civilized morals; but the morals of the Heroic Age are founded on individuality, and on nothing else.","The Border Ballads, for instance, and the Robin Hood Ballads, clearly suppose a state of society which is nothing but a very circumscribed and not very important heroic age.","The epic poet collaborates with the spirit of his time in the composition of his work. That is, if he is successful; the time may refuse to work with him, but he may not refuse to work with his time.","The epic poet has behind him a tradition of matter and a tradition of style; and that is what every other poet has behind him too; only, for the epic poet, tradition is rather narrower, rather more strictly compelling.","The reason can only be this: heroic poetry depends on an heroic age, and an age is heroic because of what it is, not because of what it does.","The world knows of a vast stock of epic material scattered up and down the nations; sometimes its artistic value is as extraordinary as its archaeological interest, but not always.","With several different kinds of poetry to choose from, a man would decide that he would like best to be an epic poet, and he would set out, in conscious determination, on an epic poem."],"Lashana Lynch":["I sang when I was in primary school, and I did singing at Sylvia Young: no acting at all.","Every day. Every single day, I can watch 'Bridesmaids.'","At the end of the day, it's all about the story.","I am very competitive, and I have always wanted to stand out and be the best, but I have always been like that."],"Lasse Hallstrom":["I really want to have actors contribute their own ideas, with phrasings and ideas on all levels.","My father would tell anyone who would listen that this dentist thing he was doing was not his passion; cinematography was.","I always need a couple of highlights to really spark the passion for a project.","I got to work with my wife, Lena Olin, for the first time, which was great. I thought it might be difficult in some way to talk to one's wife in a different way but it was so not forced.","To see my wife getting inspired from my notes and thoughts, going in the direction I wanted, and have her surprise me with wonderful choices was a real treat.","I can't go back and label myself as an outcast because I was a pretty well-adjusted kid, but I can certainly relate to the feeling of being an outsider.","It's just, for me, the natural standard: a woman should be able to decide over her own body.","I love mixing amateurs and professionals.","I love improvising.","I love involving actors at all levels - and they have to know that I want to hear their contributions, with dialogue, with story suggestions, with script changes, whatever.","I think I avoid stepping into sentimentality by trying to be as truthful as possible with performances.","I discovered the 7th art at home when I was kid, through Charlie Chaplin's movies and those of my father who shot documentaries. He was my biggest influence. So I took his camera and started shooting.","But now I wish I could back to Stockholm to make international films there.","I was always attracted by the European way of life, but I am deeply Swedish.","I always try to preserve my cinematographic style, even while I work in the US. I wish to always be European.","Cinema has become a global economy, totally international.","I feel the need to work with my wife, Lena Olin, again.","I'm on this diet where you're supposed to eat only fish and meat.","I imagined that it might be awkward to talk to your wife about her performance, so going into it I was a little nervous. But doing it was actually a wonderfully inspiring experience.","My key interest in choosing scripts is character-driven stories, because there are so many stories that sacrifice character for plot.","But I notice that there is a lack of darkness in my movies and I don't know where that comes from.","I made all their videos, apart from the last two, so if you ever see an Abba video on TV then it's my stuff.","ABBA: The Movie; I got a lot of grief for working on that.","Many of the comedies I had made in Sweden were slightly based on semi-autobiographical experiences, so adapting novels was a very different experience.","Kevin, as the whole cast is, just wonderful people and great people, and people who are attracted to this kind of material and accepting the idea of going to Newfoundland and knowing the kind of lack of amenities.","My films do have characters who have trouble escaping the world around them.","My father was an amateur filmmaker who shot 8mm color documentaries.","I am always more interested in performance and character depiction, and my direction says as much.","It was important on The Shipping News to have my house far enough away from each location so I had this time in the morning to think about my shots and still remain open to surprises once I got to the set.","A film that is bleached tends to have a more realistic quality."],"Lata Mangeshkar":["I believe in one power, and that is the hand of God. I respect all religions.","From my experience and understanding, I believe money follows name and fame, while recognition calls for a huge amount of sacrifice. To get something, you have to lose something. That's the rule of life.","I've always loved life, irrespective of all the ups and downs that have filled my journey.","As a singer, you have to bring the soul to the song.","I feel I am a little unfit for the kind of music that is being made today. There is a big difference between what I sang earlier and what is being made now. I am not saying this music is bad, but there are too many beats.","I appreciate the change associated with people's growth, but I don't like the changes in our lives. I came to Mumbai in 1945, so imagine my acceptance of the massive changes around. I have witnessed every kind of revolution.","Nowadays, there are seven music directors in one film. I had never heard of such a thing before. If one of our old music directors was told to share a score with others, he would have left the assignment.","In my opinion, the biggest achievement was by Shankar-Jaikishan. With Raj Kapoor's 'Barsaat,' they changed the way we looked at playback singing.","The privileged classes today are bothered about petrol and diesel prices while the poor can't afford two meals a day. I am a very small person, but I want us to think beyond personal and regional interests.","I have a fierce temper. I've mastered it over the years, but when I'm angry, no one can force me to do anything I don't want to.","One has to be fully committed to one's career. Otherwise, there's no point.","My father passed away in 1942, and three-four months after his death, I had to start working. There was a responsibility on my shoulders to run the household. It was my duty as the eldest child in the house.","I have decided that I won't take up assignments that don't interest me.","I have been singing for the last 50 years, you know, so I deserve a break. Besides, there are talented singers around who can do justice to their work.","I really liked Kishore Kumar. He had a virile man's voice, and he was truly versatile.","When I started out, there was so much work that I couldn't think of doing anything else. I would go for recordings by 8.30 A.M., that, too, in trains. I used to come home at night. I was travelling alone everywhere.","I wouldn't let a biopic be made on me. That's because I don't believe in them. I don't like them.","People, who accused me of practising a monopoly were wrong. The media fuelled rumours about my 'monopoly.' The first question I was always asked during interviews was about my supposed monopoly.","There are so many songs that I could not sing the way I wanted to. When such songs come on television or radio, I shut them off or leave the room.","Today, the scope for variety has shrunk drastically. There are only a handful of topnotch composers like A. R. Rahman, Anu Malik, Jatin-Lalit... that's it.","I feel God has sent me to Earth to sing. I started singing when I was five, but I don't think I've worked as hard as many other people.","I missed out on my childhood. I had to work hard, but I was immediately given a place in playback.","I wish I had given more time to learning classical singing.","I think playback singing has a lot to do with voice acting. I would suggest to all the youngsters to understand the character, situation, and the story behind the songs. That is when you can add soul to the rendition which, I think, is missing in today's music.","For me, awards are a token of respect that people are giving me. So no matter how many awards I am receiving, I always feel emotional."],"Latrell Sprewell":["When I was put in a situation where I'm going there, you have to look at the team and the possibility that hey, we can probably do some good things over there.","It always feels good to come back here. I love New York... it's just nice to see a lot of familiar faces.","Sometimes change is good. Although I didn't want to leave.","So much tension around here in New York. They want to fine you for every little thing you do.","Over there, Kevin McHale, I feel like I'm talking to someone I know. It's just a total different atmosphere.","I think it was one of the better meetings that I've had with those guys, because I was honestly able to say everything I wanted to say, and I pretty much aired out the dirty laundry. So from that point on, I thought all of that was behind us.","I'm still going to have to go out and score, but defensively hopefully I can make them a little bit better.","Sam is there, Sam has been playing well, he has been doing great in camp.","I just meant as far as coming to the games on time; it was just like I was under the microscope, every little thing, it was like they were looking for me to come in here with my shoes untied.","Well I forgot how different it was because I've been here for about four or five years. It's a big load off my shoulders now. Now that I'm there, I'm like, man, I can breathe a little bit, you know?","I love New York. A part of me will always be here. What can I say.","They got all the size over there, and the teams are really good, so, I think night after night you're just going to have to be ready to lace them up and be ready to play. The teams out there are really good.","I definitely think that myself and Sam will help the Timberwolves.","You guys know the way I play. And what's so ironic is, KG is the same way. I'm looking at him in practice and going, 'Wow, I'm always that guy,' you know?","And for the first time in a long time, I'm playing along somebody that has that same energy and fire and plays pretty much the same way I do. So, that was just nice to say.","I think was able to do a lot of things here.","I think that was one thing I definitely brought to the table, my aggressiveness and my style of play, and I think that's one of the reasons why the fans here really appreciated the way that I went out and played, just because I think they kind of liked that.","I think it'll be an emotional day. It'll be exciting for me, mostly it'll be exciting for them. I'm not going to get to come here a lot, so, it'll be a special day, hopefully.","Fortunately for me I was able to do well here, and it really did great things for my career and now hopefully I can go out there and continue to do what I did.","I'm 33 years old now. I really want that ring. I got a taste of it here.","I know just one thing is those guys, KG and everyone, they're hungry. They want it bad. Sam's the only one that's had that, has the ring. Other than him, everybody else over there, we want it bad."],"Laura Amy Schlitz":["People tend to associate fairies with princesses, but they couldn't be more different. Princesses have dynastic and domestic pressures, and they get parked on glass hills. Fairies don't have families. They don't clean or cook. They sip nectar from flowers and dance by the light of the moon.","I became fascinated by marionettes, which I first saw in Venice. They were so haunted and so alive. You walked by them, and you could feel their presence, with their beady eyes just fixed on you.","One day, I was at my grandmother's house, and I found diaries that she kept as a young girl. I opened one to a page that had flowers glued inside. In her childish handwriting, my grandmother wrote, 'Pap died today. I am very sad.' The fact that this was true and that I could see the withered flowers made a huge impression on me.","I'm like a crockpot on low heat. My mind constantly comes up with ideas, but I abandon a lot of them after a week or two. It's the ones that keep coming to me, that keep picking up flavors, that haunt me, those are the ones that wind up getting written.","I could make up characters till the cows came home. Plot's what hard. Very hard.","Sometimes I feel like an impostor, and I have to remind myself, 'You are able to do this.' I look at the books on the shelf that have my name on them to remind myself I have done it before and, likely, I can do it again.","When I was 4 years old, I woke up in the middle of the night and told my parents there was a witch crying outside in the boxwood bushes. I didn't know who she was or why she was crying, but I was terribly upset.","I tell 'Hansel and Gretel' stories about heroic children who are lost in a world that seems friendly at first, and then isn't.","I was fascinated by fairies when I was growing up, and I wanted to see one dreadfully.","As an author, you think you know where the good parts and the bad parts are. And then you read to a group of children, and you learn when you're boring them, and you hurry through those sections to get to the parts where they're interested again. You start to get a sense of your story's rhythm and flow.","Folklore has a moral center to it. Folklore is always, always, always on the side of the underdog, and children have a natural instinct towards justice. They feel indignation at needless cruelty and wistfulness about acts of mercy and kindness.","I tried for years to get an agent because I was told you needed an agent. The agent-hunting process was grim indeed.","If you're not going to wear a tiara when you win a Newbery Award, when are you going to wear one?","Novels taught me that history is dramatic. I wanted my students to know that, too.","When I was a child, I wanted to be important."],"Laura Anne Gilman":["I think getting up every morning is the most amazing thing any of us do. We know what's out there, and yet we keep going.","When I first started working on 'Staying Dead,' I got some well-meaning but negative feedback from industry folk because - back in 2001 - epic fantasy was still the big thing, alternate history a tight runner-up.","I have opinions, sure, but they're mine, not something I'm going to insist everyone else take as any kind of gospel.","A reviewer once commented that my urban fantasy novels were paced more like epic fantasy, in that they relied on complex world-building and a gradual immersion in the lives of the characters.","The classic epic fantasy is good versus evil, underdog against power.","Winemakers have to adapt to what they're given by nature: the vines, the fruit, the soil and the weather.","In my next life, I want to be a housecat. Naps all the time!","You're an artist when you're writing, a businessperson the rest of the time.","I tend not to reread books, because there's always something new to discover, but Dorothy Sayers is a comfort grab for me - there's no mood so bleak or cold so bad that Lord Peter and Bunter can't make it right.","Every time we revise our history, we also revise the mythology of our history."],"Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen":["My giving story started with my parents - my late mother, Frances Arrillaga, who dedicated her life to philanthropic and community service, and my father, John Arrillaga, whose daily generosity of heart, mind, and hands-on contributions make him one of the most extraordinary philanthropists I know.","As technology changes the way we communicate, connect, create, consume and innovate, it is democratizing access to opportunity. Education is no exception.","Philanthropy is often seen as society's risk capital. That means the onus is on philanthropists, nonprofit leaders and social entrepreneurs to innovate. But philanthropic innovation is not just about creating something new. It also means applying new thinking to old problems, processes and systems.","Proactive giving is what you do when you've found your passion. It expresses your values, interests and concerns. It engages not just your dollars, but also your mind, time, skills and networks - the philanthropic equivalent of leaning in, rather than leaning back. Most importantly, proactive giving is something you want to do.","In my view, a philanthropist is anyone who gives anything - time, money, experience, skills or networks - in any amount, to create a better world. This is not how we once thought about philanthropy. The word used to conjure up something rather passive - sitting down and writing checks.","Being innovative in your philanthropy allows you to stride forward in your giving journey; you can marry your mind and heart to turn charity into lasting impact; and you can become more ambitious in your giving.","When incomes and bonuses decrease, revenues falter, and businesses stumble, it's more important than ever to give - not necessarily more, but in a way that matters more. When incomes are down and wallets are stretched, the effectiveness of our giving is what really counts.","'Giving 2.0' was born of my desire to redefine and democratize philanthropy.","You can express your generosity in ways that are virtually limitless. This was what I wanted to convey in 'Giving 2.0' - that whether you have $10 or $10 million to give, if you identify the right opportunities and make the most of your resources, your impact can be tremendous.","My father taught me many important giving lessons, but two stand out. First, always give as much as you possibly can. And second, give equally from among your resources - your time, your mind and your capital. These are principles I live by.","As technology breaks down the physical barriers of college campuses, the extraordinary intellectual capital of the educator community is becoming available to anyone committed to learning - regardless of age, income or location.","When I started teaching at Stanford Graduate School of Business in 2000, no field-based courses in strategic philanthropy existed.","By making all my materials freely available through 'Giving 2.0' ProjectU, I am on a mission to extend philanthropy education to colleges globally and far beyond campus walls.","Philanthropic dollars are precious resources, so it's our responsibility to consider how we use them carefully. Yet few of us spend enough time doing so.","Of course, giving is deeply emotional. But supplementing emotion with research makes it more likely that a gift can have a bigger impact. It's like any investment. After all, you wouldn't put funds into stocks or bonds without understanding the potential return. Why wouldn't you do the same when investing in society?","The fact that 35 percent of all American giving went to religious organizations in 2010 reflects how closely bound many of us are with our place of worship.","Giving is an expression of gratitude for our blessings.","Religion is a complex and often contradictory force in our world. It fosters hope and comfort but also doubt and guilt. It creates both community and exclusion. It brings societies together around shared belief and tears them apart through war. However, what unites the faithful, whatever their religion, is the unshakeable force of generosity.","As philanthropists, the most powerful legacy we can create is one that keeps on giving - through our children.","Suggest your children try tithing - giving 10 percent of their allowance to a charity every month.","When you give as a family, not only are you sharing the happiness that giving brings you by watching it translate into positive change, but you are also transmitting your giving values to your children by engaging them in the giving process itself.","My mother taught me that to maximize your philanthropic potential, you need to constantly challenge your capabilities and put yourself in situations that are not always comfortable. Through her example, I discovered that there is no more beautiful way to live a life than to live a life of service.","Too often we're happy to receive thanks from the nonprofits we fund, accepting gratitude instead of feedback or performance measurements.","Nonprofits are the intermediaries between generosity and social change.","Online, you can become much more than a reactive donor - you can become a proactive, strategic, collaborative philanthropist, improving your giving every day by tapping into the wealth of philanthropic resources available at the tap of a keyboard or the click of a mouse.","Shouldn't you put the same amount of effort into your giving as you might for your for-profit investments? After all, philanthropy is an investment, and one in which lives - not profits - are at stake.","Instead of waiting until the holiday season - when mail solicitations flood in from worthy organizations - and making a flurry of gifts because this is the time of year to give, sit down and take stock. Identify your passion, learn about it, and direct your time, mind, and dollars to aligned causes and organizations.","Actively deciding to give to causes that move you deeply is far more fulfilling than the momentary gratification derived from signing a check and mailing it to a nonprofit about which you know little more than what's on the brochure they sent you.","I want to empower and educate and inspire individuals who are giving to give in a way that is more meaningful. The more meaningful our giving is, the more giving we will do.","'Giving 2.0' frames giving as a learning experience and encourages everyone to make giving a part of your year-round life.","How I see my career is very much as an entrepreneur in the field of philanthropy.","'Giving 2.0' is about making your giving matter more to the people we all hope to help, and it's about making your giving matter more to you.","My father has been to me a paragon of what actualizing philanthropic potential can be.","When I look at founders and CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook and Brian Chesky at Airbnb and Sebastian Thrun at Udacity, these are companies that are creating extraordinary social good and extraordinary economic and educational empowerment, all within with context of a for-profit model.","Historically, philanthropy has been something that you do when you turn 65, and you are retired, and you have spent your life accumulating your financial resources, and now you finally have time to do it. But because of the Internet revolution, that in turn revolutionized economic growth and wealth generation."],"Laura Ashley":["We don't want to push our ideas on to customers, we simply want to make what they want."],"Laura Bailey":["I guess anime helped me understand the Japanese culture a little better and makes me want to honor certain language nuances that don't always translate to English.","I think starting in anime, like I did, gave me a good idea of how to approach games that come from Japan. Japanese developers can be very different from companies here in the western market.","It's nice, because after you've worked with various directors and producers enough times, they start to know your voice and what you're capable of.","It's fun to grow with a character over the course of a TV series. Video games are usually a much more condensed process."],"Laura Bell Bundy":["It always amazes me when I see young people with raw talent and passion.","I've always listened to and loved country music ever since I was a kid.","I had a band with a girl in New York, and we would go around and do gigs. And then I happened to start getting work as an actress.","'Hairspray' was my first Broadway show. In the meantime, after the show was over, I would go down and do gigs at these clubs that I wasn't even old enough to get into. That continued on, and I think what ended up happening was that I just got these incredible opportunities on Broadway.","I'm fearless, to a degree.","A lot of the music I listen to is indie rock. It's not on the radio.","I was kind of going that route with my country music. Indie country. Which would work, if I was playing on Americana stages. Unless I had a television outlet like 'Glee'.","I kept writing all these ballads; they're me speaking about life. But how am I gonna do the live show I wanna do if I don't have something I can dance to?","I started to write a lot of ballads that were sultry and had a Norah Jones-for-country kind of feel. I wanted to bring elements of old soul music and old country music.","I am trying so hard to live in the moment and enjoy it while it's happening, because it feels like a moving freight train that I just got on, and I'm trying not to look back and get dizzy!","I feel really blessed to first of all have the opportunity to do music, and second of all to have it be going well.","I had a very active imagination as a kid, and I was constantly performing, whether I was making money doing it or not, whether it was on a stage in front of 1,000 people or in the living room in front of my family.","My father has a manufacturing company in Kentucky, and he's an electrical engineer. A brilliant man. A brilliant businessman. So he understands the business aspects of my business very well. My dad and I always communicate when I have to negotiate a deal.","I dropped the 'Bundy' with my country music because I wanted it to be two separate things: There's me as a songwriter and a country singer, and there's me as a Broadway performer.","I can't take the theater side out of myself.","I can only speak for myself and my own music, because that is what I am most familiar with, and I write about things that I am living or experiencing.","When I was really little, I listened to Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, Barbara Mandrel, Crystal Gayle, Kenny Rogers, Willie Nelson, and Patsy Cline.","Around 14, I was turned on to Shania, Reba, Merle Haggard, Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood... and I've followed it ever since.","I listened to country music my whole life. I started writing music when I was a teenager. It all came out country.","What I loved about country music when I was a kid was the Grand Ole Opry, was 'Hee Haw,' was 360 degrees of entertainment.","You know, I had the music baskets and the writing basket. And I had the acting. And those eggs just hatched first, and the others were slow to incubate.","I kinda went through a semi-depression. Honestly. Like, I lost myself.","When creating an album, one of the first things you have to think about is what you want your production style to be.","I actually had a week where I literally wrote four songs and all of them are on my album. But sometimes you'll go a week where you'll write songs and they never see the light of day. So that process takes a long time.","There is definitely that thing here a little where people are like 'Oh that Broadway girl has come to Nashville' and I'm like 'Listen you guys, I was singing country before I even got a Broadway show. And I'm from Kentucky.'","I always have plans to return to the stage. I leave myself very open. I think what would be more likely is if I did a limited run of something, whether it be a play or a musical.","'Hairspray' was a show I was involved in from the very first reading, and I was 19. And, 'Hairspray', was one of my favorite movies growing up."],"Laura Benanti":["I think that I come off as, 'Nothing bothers me, I don't care! I'm funny and sassy.' But I'm deeply sensitive. Not only about myself but to others. Not to pat myself on the back, empathy is a quality I've cultivated over my life. It came naturally to me as a child.","I think that people are most comfortable when they can put you in a box - and that's very easy to do that when someone can put you in more serious roles. I'm not blaming them for that - it's just up to me to show people what I can do.","If you can hear music, you can hear the musicality of the way someone speaks. It's easier to nail down the way that they talk. So much of it is listening, just like in acting. If you're listening, you pick up the nuance of why a person behaves the way that they behave.","I try to give the appearance that I have it all together and that I know what I'm talking about, but at the end of the day, I think I might be full of crap.","I do think musical-theater actors can get a bad rap, and I see why. There is a certain slickness - there's nothing better than an amazing musical, but an okay musical can be one of the worst times you've ever had.","Well, I'm grateful for all the experiences that I've had.","I think that every therapist that I know, including my dad and my sister, have their own issues. But that empathy is what makes them good at their job.","There's a lot of pressure on Broadway. There's this feeling that the show has to be a commercial success and the producers have to make their money back and Tonys and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.","I was not a fan of the Bush administration, as I think many of us were not.","My mother was an actress and my voice teacher, an incredible voice teacher. My biological father is an actor, and my stepfather, who raised me along with my mother, is a psychotherapist. I was always supported in creative ventures.","I don't think theater is dying, and musicals are a great American art form. We've got apple pie, jazz and musical theater.","I was a little girl who grew up idolizing musical-theatre stars.","Musical theatre is my first love.","Of course I wanted an agent from the time I was like 5, but my mother was like, 'No, you're going to be normal, you're going to go to school, you're going to get good grades, you're going to play soccer, and if you do well, if you keep your grades up, you can do one community-theater show a year.'","I was always a little adult. Even as a little kid, I just couldn't understand why I was surrounded by all these kids. I took things very seriously.","I actually enjoy Britney Spears. Not as a singer but as a performer. I just enjoy watching her. I think, 'You are so brave.'","My parents were in 'Brigadoon' on Broadway when I was a couple of years old.","Do I want to write a musical? No. I like to do musicals.","A lot of times, when you're the leading lady, you get to sing heartwarming songs and that's it, and people don't get a sense of who you truly are.","Usually, in musical theater, if you sing operatically or if you sing in a legit style, you're the heart of the show. You maybe get to be moving and do dramatic stuff, but it's very rare to be that funny.","I grew up loving musicals. My mom had records of original cast recordings, and one of them was 'She Loves Me.' I wore that thing out singing along to Barbara Cook when I was eight years old.","I'm very grateful for social media. I think it has shown people my true nature, and through that has come a book deal, and I think it certainly contributes to people's view of me as a person with a sense of humor, which is only helpful in my industry.","I do think that having the villain be a woman is just as feminine, because we're not just saying, 'Women are wonderful and made of marshmallows,' but women can be anything. They can be amazing superheroes, or they can be dastardly villains, and everything in between.","For me, Melania represents America. We're all reluctantly married to Donald Trump now. She is a vehicle to making fun of him. I can't do a Donald Trump impersonation, but I can impersonate her.","For me, Kate McKinnon can do no wrong. She is an absolute genius. She's a hero of mine. Melissa McCarthy is hilarious.","When I was 5 years old, I was coming up the stairs, and I saw my mom standing there, singing 'A Quiet Thing' a cappella, and it was such a differentiating moment for me. I realized that we are separate from each other - she has dreams and goals.","I was pregnant, and, like, 'Being a mom's going to be easy!' And now I'm like, 'Great.'","It's always fun to play someone who is a little off. Normal is a little boring.","If people don't like your act, it feels a little bit more like they don't like you as opposed to they didn't like that character... It's weird because on one hand, we make our living from being permeable and vulnerable, but we also have to have very thick skin.","Most people don't even get to be on TV, so I got to be on TV a bunch of times... I feel so lucky that I get to go back and forth between television and theater.","I always approach every role through a lens of comedy.","That's all TV acting is. Like, let me find my mark and seem like I'm still acting. Sometimes they'll put sandbags there, but then it's even funnier because you're walking and you're, like, stepping into sandbags, so now you look like you're having a seizure.","I was in Nashville quite a bit when I shot 'Nashville,' and I was in Los Angeles when I shot in 'Supergirl'.","I love doing concerts. For me, it's the favorite thing I do. I get to communicate with the audience in a direct way.","I've worked so hard since I was 18 years old, and I'd hate for the memories to be boiled down to being a Melania Trump impersonator.","For me, even if I'm singing to a very large audience, like in 'The Sound of Music Live' or in the 'She Loves Me' broadcast, I try to imagine that I am just singing to each individual. It doesn't change my energy other than being perhaps a bit more nervous. I try to sing to each person and right into their individual heart.","Television can be a little tricky in terms of finding roles that feel fully flushed out, which is why I love being in the theater so much, because the roles tend to be really on the page.","I feel like comedy is important, and I think political satire can be really important.","People don't say they're pregnant until the second trimester. I intellectually understand that you don't want the whole world to know your business, but at the same time, what does that mean? You don't tell your employers you're pregnant, but then when you miscarry, no one knows you miscarried. Miscarrying is a horrible, painful event.","I think we've become a TV culture, where we forget the live performer in front of us can see us. I think there is a self-centeredness that happens. There's nothing more important than what you are doing in that moment. So, unless it's an emergency, put your phone away.","I am not so secretly a comedian. I write a lot of my own material if you've seen videos I've done. I write jokes.","My favorite show tune has got to be Stephen Sondheim's 'I Remember Sky.' It's probably the saddest song of all time; I sing it to myself in the mirror. No, I am kidding. That's the joke."],"Laura Branigan":["I want to touch people's hearts, to get right down to their souls.","I want a place where I can have horses.","When you're on stage, the audience becomes your other half. It's the ultimate high you can reach as a musician - an incredible feeling. And no matter where I am it's still the same; there's a reason we call music the universal language.","I want to move people the way Edith Piaf did."],"Laura Bush":["Libraries allow children to ask questions about the world and find the answers. And the wonderful thing is that once a child learns to use a library, the doors to learning are always open.","The power of a book lies in its power to turn a solitary act into a shared vision. As long as we have books, we are not alone.","If I'm just at the White House, I have meetings in my office, I sign letters, I plan different things. Late in the afternoon, I'll quit working and wait for my husband to get home.","Every child in American should have access to a well-stocked school library.","In fact, I have the privilege of traveling around our country and meeting people all over the country who are making a huge difference in the lives of their neighbors and themselves. That's what I'm really fortunate to be able to do.","A love of books, of holding a book, turning its pages, looking at its pictures, and living its fascinating stories goes hand-in-hand with a love of learning.","We can overcome evil with greater good.","Well, we've faced very difficult decisions and challenges in our country, every one of us have, as we - since September 11th, as we fought the war on terror, all of those decisions that the President had to make to put young men and women in harm's way.","You know, there are a lot of would-be governors of Texas sitting around today who never took the opportunity to get into a race when the time was right.","Maybe it is the media that has us divided.","It's not easy to have the job of president. It's not easy to run for it. And it's not a job for the feint of heart.","I think there are a lot of reasons to be critical of the media in America.","I also want to encourage anybody who was affected by Hurricane Corina to make sure their children are in school.","I also know that there are a lot of people around the United States who want my husband to win and who are for him and who support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I feel good about those people, too.","I'm not the one who was elected. I would never do anything to undermine my husband's point of view.","I don't really feel like I have to have a debate with my husband over issues.","But we talk about issues, we talk about people, we talk about personalities. George is a very good reader of people, and he's very perceptive about people, and you know, that's fine.","I mean, it's fun for us to talk about issues. You know, there's no one issue we spend a lot of time on probably, because he gets to do that all day with somebody else who's a lot more expert at issues than I am.","Jenna's traveled with me; they've both traveled with their dad. This is the only time they've been old enough in all of their dad's campaigns to really be involved in.","They're great girls. They're very funny, they're very smart, they're fun to be with. They're very lively, as I think people can tell. And you know, they're very confident girls.","We always get up about 5:30, and George gets up and goes in and gets the coffee and brings it to me, and that's been our ritual since we got married. And we read the newspapers in bed and drink coffee for about an hour probably, read our briefing papers.","But you know, it's not easy when your husband runs for president. I mean, it's not easy for me. I'm sure it's not easy for her. There's a lot of scrutiny on families that isn't always wanted.","I like politics. I like traveling in the United States.","Politics is a people business. I like people.","I mean, the part you don't like, I mean, that's the only part. That's the part no one likes, and that is the criticisms, and the unfair criticisms, I might add, of my husband. But that's also just a fact of life in politics.","I don't like that, because there are a lot of people whose works I admire as actors or actresses, or musicians. And you know, I've been a big fan of different musicians or actors.","No one likes to be criticized.","When we look around the world today, when we see in Afghanistan that 10 million people have registered to vote in their upcoming elections, including 40 percent of those people are women, that's just unbelievable.","I would never do anything to undermine my husband's point of view.","Though my plans at the moment are vague, I can assure you that I'll never run for the Senate in New York.","Any first lady can do whatever they want to do. In this country, people expect them to work on whatever they want or to have a career of their own."],"Laura Carmichael":["I grew up listening in awe to stories of their wartime adventures. My granny, Joan, was a journalist and wrote amazing letters to my grandpa when he was a prisoner of war, while my nana, Mary, was a Land Girl, then a Wren. They were so independent, resilient and glamorous.","I have two sisters, and we are the best of friends.","I don't really get recognised very much.","I've not sat with my agent going: 'Where is the next hopeless girl I can play?' They just come along.","You have to have sympathy for and an empathy with a character in order to play them.","I have such a huge girl crush on Beyonce.","I cry at films and TV and even adverts.","When I emerge from filming I feel slightly out of synch with real life, but it's also a relief.","When I'm in a tricky situation I often think: 'What would Beyonce do?' It helps.","I certainly never saw myself as posh.","I did all sorts of jobs after drama school - working in a bar, as a teaching assistant. I probably learned as much from them as I did at drama school.","I'm not recognised much at all.","I'm from Southampton.","In the U.K., there is a sort of obsession with class.","As actors, you play people who are not yourselves!","I think it must be so hard to start your career with everyone going on about how gorgeous you are. To be in that bracket must be so pressurised.","It's beneficial to play against your type; to be chameleon-like.","Playing a plainer role means everything is dependent on the credentials of the actor, not the fact that they are as pretty as Julia Roberts. People start to look at their talent rather than their appearance. And playing the ugly part often means less time in the make-up chair, which is a great benefit on set.","My history teacher was utterly terrifying, but her lessons were very inspiring. She got me interested in people and stories, which then led me to acting.","I'd love to work in the States; I'd love to work anywhere where you get a good script and a good part to play. But I do love British film as well.","I think as an actor you're used to having to travel, so wherever the work, is you're willing to go.","We all have hierarchies at work - even on set, the runner would never walk up to the director and ask for a cup of coffee.","There is no way I'd have wanted to live in the Twenties. It was really crap for women.","There's something about wearing clothes that your great-grandmother might have thought were nice that makes you look older.","In a way, it's good not to be recognised as much off screen.","Sometimes we do things that are really awful.","No one goes through life thinking that they're the best friend of the lead character.","I've been really lucky because I've managed to become wonderful friends with a handful of very talented British designers. Christopher Kane has become one of my very good friends - also Erdem. Jonathan Saunders is another brilliant talent who's very kind. We all hang out.","The Twenties have this sort of attitude where you never know what's around the corner.","I'm rubbish at Twitter.","If I'm tweeting about being somewhere, and I haven't replied to somebody's email from three days ago, that's quite rude."],"Laura Chinchilla":["Women continue receiving less salary for the same kind of job. Women have a higher unemployment rate in our country. When you analyze the composition of poverty, you will find that most of the families in poverty are being run by a woman.","Costa Rica is not afraid to go before any international body.","The Internet is the hope of an integrated world without frontiers, a common world without controlling owners, a world of opportunities and equality. This is a utopia that we have been dreaming about and is a world in which each and every one of us are protagonists of a destiny that we have in our hands.","When you face unexpected events, you have to try to overcome those problems, but at the same time, you have to continue working according to the plan that you defined since the beginning. So that's what we have tried to do - not to avoid the urgent responses but to continue the route that we had defined.","I want to thank the pioneering women who years ago opened the doors of politics in Costa Rica. My government will be open to all Costa Ricans of good faith.","A government should not function based on the pressures of some or others. It should try to adapt a mix of measures that fits every context and generates the appropriate steps forward.","You don't only have the need to do it well because leading a country is something quite important, but also because I am the first woman I have the obligation to do it the best possible way so my country can continue voting for women in the future. It is a big responsibility.","Costa Rica, with its tourist-based economy and lack of a national army, has focused on keeping safe its beaches, parks and other public draws. It is one if the safest countries in Central America based on the number of homicides.","We want to bridge the digital gap to provide broadband access to 100 per cent of our educational institutions and to make it widely available to all people.","We want to allow Costa Ricans to make a qualitative leap in our development and go to an economy based on innovation and developing a broadband infrastructure in order to overcome the barrier of 15 per cent penetration."],"Laura Dekker":["As soon as I get on my boat, something inside me changes. Then I really feel what living is.","I follow my own head. And if I'm determined to do something, then I'll make sure that I make it happen.","When I'm not surfing or sailing, I am to be found at the harbour working on my boat.","I really like boats. If you want to go somewhere, you just take your house with you.","Since I was 10 years old, I knew I wanted to sail around the world.","A house is kind of scary.","Over a period of 11 months, I was constantly afraid that Youth Care would lock me up. It was all a frightening and traumatic experience. So often, these terrible memories come to me. I can't ignore them.","At sea, I feel comfortable and I come to rest.","I am not going to say much about the film 'Maidentrip,' but I won't be representing it, as I am not fully standing behind it.","I grew up sailing in the North Sea.","It was really weird dealing with the media. I had no idea how to handle it.","I do not often get lonely, and I never get bored.","I love my parents. But they have their life, and I have mine.","I want simply to learn about the world and live freely.","I was four when I first stood at the helm on my own.","I'm still not used to the idea of being the youngest circumnavigator.","As a 13-year-old girl, it was never my intention to be the center of world news.","My parents have sailed around the world; they know what can happen and that it's not always fun, but because I want to do it so much, they agreed and supported me.","In England, I met a couple who run a children's home. They were very kind and showed me many nice spots in England.","All the media are horrible."],"Laura Dern":["We like our archetypes and heroes to be what they are at face value. And life doesn't work out like that.","Stay true to your own voice, and don't worry about needing to be liked or what anybody else thinks. Keep your eyes on your own paper.","Like anything else, acting can become boring - a chore, really - if there isn't any challenge. And I like taking challenges. Just when people think they have me figured out, I like to surprise them.","I can't say 'I'm proud to say' - because it's not a choice for many Americans - but I can say I'm fortunate enough to not be raising my kids on McDonald's.","I grew up with a tribe of amazing women, but certainly my mother and my godmother really modeled women as actors.","Decision-making is very scary for me.","That's life - to turn each other on, to feel good, to feel in love.","Meditation is a practice that is considered mainstream: The NFL uses it, the NBA uses it, heart patients use it. It's very easy to consider yourself a meditator and not be too alternative-minded.","Jealousy is a scary thing.","The really courageous and bold thing is to make movies about human behaviour.","Starting my career as a kid, I was doing what jobs I got.","My daughter wants to do yoga with me and wants to be in the theater thing, and I can't tell her, 'Don't be an actress.' My son loves guitar and loves to be in a band and wants his iTunes downloaded with all this old-school hip-hop so he understands where hip-hop came from.","Going to the Academy Awards is something I remember since I was six, when I went with my mom for the first time, 14 with my dad, you know, and there I am, at 22, 23, whatever I was, sitting next to my mom. You know, and then again, there with my dad. Like, there's a beauty to it, and I care deeply about film history.","Whatever character you play, it gives you the chance to expose another side of yourself that maybe you've never felt comfortable with, or never knew about.","I made a commitment to myself; that I wanted to be an actress, and I wanted to do films that make a difference. It has to move people.","I think people do their bravest work when given an elusive canvas. That would be seemingly the weirdest, but also the most wonderful.","I don't turn my nose up at anything. If it's a great part, it's a great part. I'd love to do a box-office hit.","I hope we can be consummate artists as women or revolutionaries, or whatever women want to be, and also have love, not only for ourselves but from a partner.","I knew you had to go in and audition and maybe they'd hire you, and that's where you start. I had a good understanding about press: that it's the actor's responsibility to publicize his or her films.","I like movies about longing and desperation, and dark and light things, stories about people struggling to raise children, and to have relationships and be intimate with each other.","I really don't consider myself to be a conventional Hollywood star. I've never really been marketed by the big studios to do mass market box office films.","I wanted to go to Jupiter. That was my plan from day one, and David Lynch gave me the ticket.","I was raised by an actress, and I watched all those women turn 60 and ask, Shouldn't get face work? My mother and Anne Bancroft said, We're not going to fall into that.","I'm interested in flawed protagonists. I was raised on them.","I'm lucky enough that directors sometimes seek me out for little projects that people don't even know about, that just surface later on.","I've always loved film more than theater.","It would be great to make a movie that had the style of a great '30's film.","It's a strange world, as David Lynch would say.","It's always been a desire of mine to work with my parents.","Luckily, I was raised by people who'd already seen all the yuck stuff, which is why they originally didn't want me to act. I understood the difference between getting a part at a Hollywood party and getting a job.","'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is one of the greatest films of all time.","My mother opened a bank account for me when I made $60 on my first day of work as an extra. She's that kind of mother.","There's always a side of a woman that likes a man from the other side of the tracks.","There's something so accessible about heroes who have faults.","Unfortunately, overall, movies are a conglomerate. People buy and sell people in this business, which can get really ugly.","What do you say when someone has truly inspired you? How do you express to an artist how deeply their work has affected you?","When man decides he can control nature, he's in deep trouble.","Wild at Heart made a few people angry-they thought I was exploiting women by showing that when a woman says no she really means yes.","It's really fun to act like a bimbo. But it's fun to act like a bimbo only when people know that you really aren't one.","There are a lot more female writers wanting to direct their own material and hopefully will be given the opportunity.","I knew I wanted to become an actor when I was 7 years old. My dad was working with Alfred Hitchcock, my mom was working with Martin Scorsese - and it was the great summer of my childhood.","It's my deepest interest as an actor: I love discovering how human beings work, how their flaws reveal themselves - how to learn and grow from that - and how characters teach me things as a woman and as a parent.","My dad taught me to never be pigeonholed; to really allow yourself to reinvent characters as they reinvent you; to be bold and to be willing to play seemingly unlikeable people.","I love being in my 40s.","I tend to always love material with flawed protagonists and morally ambiguous people.","I've got the sort of personality that requires me to find some sort of release, and for me, it's performing.","A lot of people have asked whether acting is in my genes. I don't know if anyone is born to act. And it certainly wasn't pushed on me. It was something I wanted to do.","I'm not averse to being a supporting character. I try to pick parts where I can add something.","Growth doesn't hurt. This is what I've learned. In the end, it doesn't hurt. It hurts while it's happening. But in the end, you know, for life, for parenting, and for the arts, it's not a bad - not a bad thing to try for.","I try to do things I love or care about for some reason.","With 'Mask,' 'Smooth Talk' and 'Blue Velvet,' I loved the specific experiences so much. Each one was a specific filmmaker with a specific vision.","I have never been someone who applied 'work begets work' to my career, sometimes unfortunately.","The bad news is, I have worked less than I have liked. The good news is, I can look back on my body of work and feel truly proud of the work I have done.","It's one thing to have forced time off as an actor, and another thing when you actually say, 'I don't want to read anything, and I don't want to talk to anybody.'","Everything's cyclical. Having been raised by actors, I watched their careers, and the challenge is to take time off.","You don't always get to work as much as you like, because I'm waiting to find things that I care about. Sometimes that's frustrating.","At the end of the day, you have to sit with the scripts and decide where your heart is.","My mother is extremely interested in everything esoteric.","All I can start with is what moves me and feels like a great challenge as an actor and I think is saying something unusual or irreverent or human - honest in some way.","I think there are ways to get so caught up in your career and being so heavy and dramatic, and everyone wants to be a tortured genius.","If we could all figure out a way to just be true to ourselves and have a good time doing what we're doing, it would be a lot more fun.","I don't want to mess with my face. So I'm becoming fluent in French so I can go to France and make French films when I'm 60.","For people who feel things in an enormous way, it's pretty hard to live in this world.","I was raised by two actors in a moment in time - the Seventies - when there was no judgment of characters, no heroes and bad guys.","Having egregious divorces - where you just hate each other - is really the easy way out.","Every role is a new form of surrender.","God bless nannies.","As an actor, you're not kind of thinking about your own work or watching the movie for the first time.","I've seen 3-D movies where it seems a little crude or too in-your-face.","Irvin Kershner, no matter what anyone says, has done some great work. 'Eyes of Laura Mars' is an incredible movie.","If you have a movie coming out, and people are talking about you, the amount of scripts will build.","What I consider a good part for a woman and what some other Hollywood people think are good women's parts are very different. I don't want to play the supportive girlfriend who has nine scenes and just loves that man, maybe cheats on him in one scene but will always be there, and I mean - give me a break.","You'll be offered the 'lead' in this new hot film with such-and-such A-list director, 'a fabulous part' - a fabulous part? A fabulous part is a character with a soul, who starts here and goes to there, you know? There aren't many of those.","I always wanted to do a 'Ms. Smith Goes to Washington.'","I was raised in the '70s, and I've worked with people I love, and I've been on sets with my parents, with people who run a set and require of actors a sense of liberty and freedom and exploration and failure into brave achievement.","For me, the greatest good fortune I have being raised by actors is I came in knowing that a career is the ebb and flow.","Any journey of a creative person has, you know, really unusual challenges and years where you don't work and years where you work.","In American culture we are supposed to take a pill when we're depressed or in grief as opposed to actually feeling.","I've worked with David Lynch since I was 17, and working with him is home and family; being around Alexander Payne is home and family, Jonathan Demme. There are directors... Robert Altman, Paul Thomas Anderson... They are directors where I create homes.","Something that I've cared about deeply my whole career is getting to work with filmmakers and inventors of stories that are hysterical because they are just so painfully true.","I got picked for very unique and independent filmmaking experiences with auteurs. And I'm so lucky.","There are people who consider it almost unpatriotic to be inquisitive and to be truthful about your opinions.","I know that I've seen a mannerism, or a way I've cried, or something, where I see a flash of my parents.","I don't think you have to be in these serious, heavy, independent little movies to be an actor. Some of the most interesting acting I've seen is on cable television.","If you're looking to be loved for a part, it's great and enticing to be adorable in a romantic comedy. But then, as an actor, you get stuck.","Anybody you make a movie with when you're 12 and they're 14, you're going to know them your whole life.","Ben Stiller, who I love and who is a friend and is such an incredible actor - he's hilarious, obviously, but I thought his performance in 'Greenberg' was extraordinary.","Unfortunately, I was making comedies in my 20s, but other people didn't realize they were comedies.","I love Clint Eastwood, and I wish to work with him again. He's completely irreverent about everything, including his own beautiful work.","Sadly, half of marriages end in divorce. Half of my girl friends and male friends have been through one, and their kids are doing great. There's no shame around it - unless you want to project that on to yourself - but certainly there's no longer cultural shame. Everyone is walking through it.","I was raised on movie sets, and I decided for myself at a very young age that it was what I wanted to do.","My dad was always interested in characters he didn't understand - he was such a great bad guy in movies. And that is really the thing that calls me to the material often: something I struggle to understand in human behaviour.","Love means a lot to me, and I love loving, and I love boys.","I will be working with David Lynch when I'm 80.","To stay true to your art is such a complicated journey, and Dad clearly has done it.","There are artists or filmmakers or cinematographers who have had long careers who, maybe to reinvent themselves or just to stay in a secure place, layer it on or ham it up, if I can use that expression, or make grand choices that don't feel as authentic as what they did to make us fall in love with them in the first place.","When you become a parent, you really care that you get that right, and you care about nothing else.","I have a very wonderfully, bizarrely amazing relationship with my mother in that we've been through a myriad of emotions because we've acted together and played all these different kinds of mother-daughters.","I'm interested in human nature. That's why I chose to become an actor.","I think it's about not just the crisis you're in, but how do you get to the other side? How do we heal? How do we survive this experience while remaining hopeful instead of filled with despair? That's what interests me.","I was raised Catholic, and my grandmother taught me to stay. As a teenager, I thought if you went on a date, you should stay for a couple of years. I didn't realize that if he wasn't your cup of tea, you got to leave.","I'm moved by people who see the world differently than others. People who see the world with a longing for its poetry often can be broken people.","I like to play people who are deeply flawed, and I want to find the good nature in them. I even try to be kind to myself when I've made big mistakes.","It's lovely to be considered pretty and lovely to do photo shoots, and I just love fashion. But I'm proud that I did the characters I wanted to do.","I always wondered what it would be like to have a normal childhood.","I was on the cover of a lot of magazines, and there were compliments about beauty and fashion and what I was wearing. Man, if you get locked into that, you can lose your freedom as an actress.","My favorite books are psychology, self-help, and I'm fascinated by Jung, by dream work.","I certainly wouldn't mind if 'Jurassic Park' turns out to be commercially successful, and somebody says, 'Hey, you were in a box-office hit, and if you want to do another movie, we'll give you five million dollars to make it.'","I resent ever being stereotyped.","I always fall in love with qualities of people I work with.","For me, the key is years of the blessed filmmakers I've worked with giving me permission to be bold and jump off cliffs and to be boundaryless. I would put David Lynch at the top of that list.","Me and Woody Harrelson, we're twins. We're the same person. I should only make movies with him.","Hopefully, film inspires you to think about human nature. It make us consider how we treat strangers and our most intimate.","What a cool job to be part of - whether it's doing lighting or acting or serving food on set. You're part of telling a story that hopefully has an essential component, and that's super exciting to me.","I care a lot about big food and everyone's right to healthy, nutritious food and what's caused obesity in America and obesity in children in America.","You know someone is your favorite person when you've done a day of press, listened to yourself ad nauseam, listened to them tell every story, and when it ends, it's like, 'Are we going to eat something?'","You must always watch when David Lynch makes anything.","I feel so lucky to have a mom who is not only an extraordinary actor but someone who is game enough to not worry about our relationship versus what we play in movies or television.","I remember there being a period of time when I had a baby, and I was so sleep-deprived that I'd get into having no filter, and that was not good.","Having been raised by actors who love moral ambiguity and flawed protagonists, I feel like it's sort of in the blood to want to take it on.","It excites me to go to a movie and be reminded that I'm human, and I'm filled with opposites, and I'm built with flaws. Part of growth and healing is recognizing that.","I love when actors can let go of where and how they have to do it, and just that we do it. That we are flawed and human, and don't worry about how we look or who we are, or that it seems too old of a character if we're still young.","When you're first reading the script and thinking about playing the part, it's slightly daunting. It's easy to question, 'Is an audience going to like me? And is that my job?'","I worked with HBO on 'Recount,' and we had a wonderful experience together. I'm such a fan of HBO and how much flexibility they give in character as well as schedule.","When you're playing someone who has a strong ego about themselves, you can't play them when you have the opposite opinion of the one they have of themselves.","I think my mom exposed me to the concept of using your voice for anything you care about.","At 12, turned 13, made a movie with Sex Pistols and The Clash. Learned about a lot of things I never knew and hope will never know again. Don't know how my parents let me do that.","It's interesting to play a real-life person who has already been a character on 'Saturday Night Live.'","David Lynch is like that - every sound, every detail to the end of making the film, he never gives up. It has to be perfect.","Being an actress my whole life, it feels so good to have a clean face when I'm off, so I'm not a big makeup wearer.","I'm a natural blonde. I was a towhead as a kid, and then it got ashier when I was 18.","I care a lot about fragrance not only in my life, but sometimes it feels right while working on a character.","Diet is weird. It's elusive. I just try to listen to my body.","People now tell me it's a good thing I stayed away from teen films. Well, it wasn't my choice. I wasn't hired.","All kids are selfish. I wanted to do homework and do my thing and call my agent. My mother's needs weren't in my mind at that moment.","Sometimes my family got me in the door. Somebody would say, 'Bruce Dern's daughter - sure I'd like to meet her.' It was a point of interest. But after five minutes of talking about my father, I still had to read for the part.","If I had different parents who were in it for the money, I might have a different perspective. But they really are artists; they intelligently approach each character and prepare in every sense of the word. I grew up in a world that had great discipline."],"Laura Donnelly":["Fishing is very meditative; you need to be able to give up control and cast out the line and then hope for the best, so in that way, it's quite like acting.","It's a funny thing when you know someone and you meet their siblings - you get so much a sense of who they are because when you can recognize similar traits in the family, you understand exactly why they are the way they are.","Any rehearsal process - I find, anyway - does have quite an effect on me, and I very much live in that world for the whole period of time that I'm involved with the production. But normally, afterwards with a little bit of space, I can come right back out of it again.","Throughout my childhood, I did a form of Irish dancing that was kind of the precursor to 'Riverdance.' It was a mixture of ballet and Irish dancing that my teacher, Patricia Mulholland, had invented, essentially. It was Irish ballet, and she would create performances based around the myths and legends of Ireland.","To be honest, accents are one of those things for me, personally, that usually come quite naturally by just listening to the people.","'Outlander' is filmed mostly around Glasgow and the central belt of Scotland, so it's lovely for me because I get to go up and spend time in the place that I lived for three years. I've got a bunch of friends in the cast because a lot of them studied at the same college as I did, and I get to see my family, most of whom now live in Scotland.","When I first read 'The River,' I had theories on what it was about, but once we got into rehearsal, I realized it's much simpler: It's about how human beings try to connect. The play holds a mirror up to the audience, and they take from it what's relevant to their lives.","It's not easy being Hugh Jackman, but he wears the attention better than anyone I've ever met. He treats every person he meets the same and finds joy in everything he does. The lesson I've learned is that if you work incredibly hard, and you're nice to everybody, you'll be fine.","Fly-fishing is really addictive.","I always look to play flawed characters. I'm not very interested in playing somebody that's just, you know, the very nice one or the attractive one, or whatever, which a lot of female parts can just be written that way.","I'm not really into method acting - the way I was taught was the good old-fashioned British way of just doing your research and getting on with it.","I was only 23 and just out of college when I filmed 'Casualty' and so nervous, but it was brilliant fun. I was really lucky, and it really helped my career.","I respect the system out there in Hollywood, I really do, but I'm very intent on art versus commerce. I want to do it all - film, TV and theatre - if it's the right job.","I was watching the Danish version of 'The Killing' when I got the audition for 'The Fall,' and I loved it; it was so original. I approached 'The Fall' with that in mind. I'd no problem with the violence - it was very clear from the script how horrifying the crimes were and that had to be shown, without going to extremes.","I've had people break into profiles on my Internet; they got into my accounts. This was at the beginning of my career. There is a fair bit of alarm when something like that happens. It definitely bothered me a lot at the time. But you move on from these things.","It's not my job to get really personal in how I express myself. I've met fans, and they've been lovely. But letting my personal life out there, I don't think is a good idea for me. I think the more you do that, the more you can be accused of encouraging that kind of attention.","You never want to sound bitter about critics, because they're entitled to do their job, too, but I place much more trust in a person who I can look in the eye and someone who I know I share some kind of taste with - so my friends, for instance. For me, a critic is unknown and therefore irrelevant.","My first mentor and inspiration was my Irish Dancing teacher Patricia Mulholland. She created her own form of dance known as Irish ballet and created stage productions of old Irish myths and legends. They were my first experiences on stage. She told my mum I was destined for the stage, and I took that as my cue.","I've still got a few moves from my days as a gymnast.","Judi Dench has always been the benchmark for me. Everything I have seen her do is incredible. I also really admire Cate Blanchett. In terms of people I have worked with, there is no one more admirable than Hugh Jackman, for his spirit, energy, generosity and hard work.","Once, and only once, I walked on stage and my mind went utterly blank! I had no idea why I was there! My fellow actors had to rescue me. I was very young and new to the business, so I'm glad it didn't give me stage fright for the rest of my life!"],"Laura Esquivel":["Cooking is one of the strongest ceremonies for life. When recipes are put together, the kitchen is a chemical laboratory involving air, fire, water and the earth. This is what gives value to humans and elevates their spiritual qualities. If you take a frozen box and stick it in the microwave, you become connected to the factory.","The kitchen is where we deal with the elements of the universe. It is where we come to understand our past and ourselves.","I am always interested in that relationship between outer reality and inner desire, and I think it is important to pay attention to the inner voice because it is the only way to discover your mission in life and the only way to develop the strength to break with whatever familial or cultural norms are preventing you from fulfilling your destiny.","Tradition is an element that enters into play with destiny, because you are born into a particular family - Jewish or Islamic or Christian or Mexican - and your family determines to some extent what you are expected to become. And society is always there attempting to determine the role we will play within it.","You'll have to forgive me this boldness, but I think women are very fortunate that men exist! The gods are very wise and certainly knew what they were doing. They created the sun and the moon, light and darkness, the eagle and the serpent, all for the same reason. They are perfect complements and the mechanism we use to reach heaven.","The same way one tells a recipe, one tells a family history. Each one of us has our past locked inside.","What has never changed, what is always present and what is, in the end, what sustains us is that energy that I talk about in 'Like Water for Chocolate...' that loving energy. Without that, I wouldn't have had the strength to keep going and enjoy life.","When I cook certain dishes, I smell my grandmother's kitchen, my grandmother's smells. I thought, 'What a wonderful way to tell a story.'","For me, love is the most important force. It moves the universe.","I acknowledge the four elements. Water in the North; incense to recognize the air in the East; flowers for the earth in the South; a candle for light from the West. It helps me keep perspective.","I believe very much in sensual powers as a means of obtaining understanding.","The only way we'll know where we're going is to look at the past and to remember who we were through ceremonies and rituals.","I grew up in a modern home, but my grandmother lived across the street in an old house that was built when churches were illegal in Mexico. She had a chapel in the home, right between the kitchen and dining room.","If you take a frozen box and stick it in the microwave, you become connected to the factory. We've forgotten who we are.","Technology and industry have distanced people from nature and magic and human values.","In film you can use images exclusively and narrate a whole story very quickly, but you don't always so easily find the form in cinema to dig deeper into human thoughts and emotions. And in a novel you can much more easily express a character's inner thoughts and feelings.","The culinary tradition in my family is very strong. My mother, a very wise woman, spent the better part of her life in a kitchen. It's a very strong part of her identity. I grew up there next to the fire.","When Chipotle asked me to take part in the Cultivating Thought program both as an author and an essay contest judge, I was excited by the idea of sharing my story through this unique channel and helping young, inspiring writers do the same.","As a very young girl, I understood that the interior activities of the home are as significant as the exterior activities of society.","I watch cooking change the cook, just as it transforms the food.","As a teacher I realize that what one learns in school doesn't serve for very much at all, that the only thing one can really learn is self-understanding, and this is something that can't be taught.","I can't speak for readers in general, but personally I like to read stories behind which there is some truth, something real and above all, something emotional. I don't like to read essays on literature; I don't like to read critical or rational or impersonal or cold disquisitions on subjects.","There are still some natural forces that everybody understands. Technology and industry have distanced people from nature and magic and human values.","What others call magic realism is normal and an everyday thing to me.","I started knitting in the Congress, and it was a scandal - like, big scandal.","The only way to find peace is when you are not separated, when you are not fighting, when you part of the whole.","I was pretty much a hippie. I was a vegetarian, gypsy-like. I liked to meditate, and it's curious because I was very much attracted to the possibility of change.","It wasn't books that inspired me to write. For me, inspiration was simple, immediate: I got it from eating, dancing, talking. I got it from life lived, things touched, from sensuality, from love of life, from our irrefutable connection to the earth.","Progress makes us lose the feeling of a ceremony that cooking should have. It has significantly shifted our values so that now it seems to us that only activities with an economic reward are worth pursuing.","We're in a period of revolutionary change. I'm optimistic. One's self changes, and then the world changes. It's going to begin internally, not externally.","What I find sad is that the New Age movement is primarily a commercial undertaking. But it is answering to a human need.","We must adjust our value systems and work to modify today's societies, in which economic interests are carried to the extreme and irrationally produce not merely objects, but weapons of war. These societies don't care about the destruction of the planet and mankind as long as they earn profits - it can't go on like this.","I wanted to share my doubts and my culinary, amorous, and cosmic experiences. So I wrote 'Like Water for Chocolate,' which is merely the reflection of who I am as a woman, a wife, a mother, a daughter.","Everyone's past is locked up in their recipes - the past of an individual and the past of a nation as well.","Many people think spending an hour or two in the kitchen is a waste of time. But it is a good investment in your spiritual development.","We know that the hardest work is to keep yourself open to the world that technology hasn't tamed.","Food can change anything.","Destiny has always been something that interested me as a subject, but not in a fatalistic way because I believe that one can transform destiny through self-knowledge.","To transform yourself is to transform your destiny.","I like vibrant colors.","To what extent has each one of us contributed to the rise in violence and hatred?","I cook. I walk. I go to the movies. I meditate."],"Laura Fraser":["When I was 18, I couldn't wait to move away. I was like: 'If I ever have to come back here, I'll kill myself.' Glasgow seemed like failure and death to me back then, but not any more.","I've been a jealous person myself. I've been distrustful, convinced that somebody's having an affair with somebody else. If you believe it in your head, everything looks like a lie. When you're looking for it, you always see it - even the change of expression in their face.","Both of my parents had a change of career. My mum was a nurse, and now she's a college lecturer.","I still have a fear of theater. I don't know if I will manage that. I used to do it. I developed a bit of a phobia. It's not a real phobia. I can go in and watch.","I expected it to be overwhelming and all-encompassing, but having a kid brings you into the world in a whole different way.","I'm not a long-term member of the 'Breaking Bad' family.","I have to admit I can be pretty high strung and tightly wound.","I think every mother feels that the best place for their child is with their mum, but you want things for yourself, too. So, you're either at work feeling guilty, or you are at home feeling frustrated.","I found it hard being a full-time mum and take my hat off to anyone who can do it.","You don't put milk in chamomile tea - that's disgusting behavior! That's not right.","It's mad what each generation vilifies. It's not necessarily to do with logic.","I suppose I'd always been attracted to commitment-phobes because some part of me felt unlovable. It was a lot easier to fall for a guy who I knew, on some level, wouldn't fall in love with me. There was nothing to risk. The real risk would be to finally be vulnerable to love.","I think I've played a lesbian about five times. The first one was with Helen Baxendale in a drama called 'The Investigator,' about the conditions lesbians had to live under in the army in Britain, which was based on a true story.","Traditionally I'm not a very good secret-keeper.","It does seem to produce more creative results when there are limitations. It's like in wartime with rations - people became more inventive with cooking.","I've always been an actor, a lowly actor without power, so I've never been corrupted. I've never even directed.","All the guys on 'Breaking Bad' are really gentle and gorgeous creatures.","It's a very strange experience being on set of 'Breaking Bad;' you never know what's coming next for your character. I feel like I don't even know if I'm going to live through the next scene I'm in. It's exciting to work on.","Even as a kid, I would always imagine horrible circumstances in which I would find myself in my head, and imagine how I would feel, and act it out a bit for myself, because I was a bit of a freak like that. I love doing things like that, and I get a real buzz from it afterwards."],"Laura Haddock":["I loved theatre and film when I was growing up in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. My mum's a reflexologist and my dad's a corporate financier.","I see my daft surname as a positive thing. It first dawned on me that I had a comical name when someone called me 'Fishface' on my first day at school. I've heard all the fish jokes since then, many times over.","I'm not the new Cameron Diaz. I'm not the new Keira Knightley, either. I don't know where these ideas come from. I'd rather be thought of as the one and only Laura Haddock. I'll happily settle for that.","I'm probably borderline OCD. I insist on having all objects at right angles to each other. So a fork has to be at a right angle to the knife on the table. The salt and pepper pots have to be placed close together. Only recently have I started to notice it's a weird way to behave.","I wouldn't say no to becoming a Bond girl. Making it in Hollywood has been my dream ever since I was little, watching Marilyn Monroe movies. To star in a Bond movie would be bliss on a stick.","I remember taking my mom and dad to the premiere of 'The Inbetweeners Movie' and being really nervous. My mom was like, 'Laura, don't worry: I've watched all of the first series of the TV show, so I understand what this is going to be like.'","I've been very lucky and been able to work, as an actress, but I'm definitely a working actress. I get a script, I audition, and then I pray.","I remember being about eight and watching 'Pollyanna' with Hayley Mills. I looked at my mum and said, 'Mum, I want to be Pollyanna.' She said, 'You're going to have to make yourself cry if you want to be an actress.' So I turned my head away, and when I turned it back I was in floods of tears.","I think it's important not to grow up too fast. I'm 26 now, and I still can't wait for Christmas Day. The inner seven-year-old isn't buried too deeply in me."],"Laura Harrier":["It's natural to get nervous about anything you care about.","I never thought I would actually become a professional actor. I just kept going with it. One thing led to another.","I come from a family of strong women, who have been positive role models for me.","I was a dramatic kid. I was always like, 'Watch me put on my play, Mom and Dad! You have to watch me put on all these outfits and do this play!' But my family is very academic and straightforward and normal Midwestern people, so the idea that I could act as an actual job wasn't really there.","We all know what it's like to go through growing pains and have awkward moments talking to someone you have a crush on.","Viola Davis is incredible - she's kind of the biggest career-wise inspiration for me. Brilliant actor, so intelligent, so strong. The path that she's made is incredible.","I think, living in the city, it's so easy to forget that you're attached to the earth.","It's hard to connect to these superheroes that are completely out of this world. But Spider-Man is first and foremost Peter Parker, who we can all relate to.","I do a lot of yoga, and that definitely helps. And Pilates is so good for your legs.","If you really want something, it's nerve-racking, but at the same time, I try not to stress myself out about it too much because there are also so many arbitrary things that go into being cast for something - you know, like the color of your eyes, all these things that are kind of out of my control.","I thought I'd be doing weird, Off Broadway theater after I graduated.","People are like, 'Was it hard growing up mixed?' 'Did you not fit in?' and I'm like, 'No? What? That's the dumbest question ever.'","Growing up, there were no families on TV that looked like mine.","I am a black woman, and of course, that's who I'm going to be playing, but I'm also biracial, and that's a different side of the experience.","I'm learning every day.","The media is controlled.","People just can't wrap their heads around two young black women in a major production.","Even though 'Spider-Man' is a huge blockbuster, it really didn't feel like that. It felt like we were making this weird, funny high school movie. Like just hanging out with a group of friends.","I just hope I can still take the subway, honestly.","My dad works in insurance; my mom is a speech pathologist. Very Midwestern, adorable childhood.","I stopped modeling so I could go to drama school at the William Esper Studio. It's Meisner.","I've been obsessed with Opening Ceremony since I moved to New York. I've spent whole paychecks there.","In high school, my mom's friend was a location scout, and there was a shoot at our house. I came home from school, and the photographer said, 'You should call my friend at this agency.'","I kind of just want to look like a cool French girl in the Sixties most of the time. Or TLC.","For me, it's all about smaller character-driven pieces, about finding a person that I connect with and that I'm interested in bringing to life.","I really connect to strong feminist writers that make their ideas accessible for the rest of the world.","I listen to a lot of Solange. I love old-school as well."],"Laura Harring":["In private, I'm a hippie who follows Buddhism, does yoga, meditates and loves to dance wildly.","Life is wonderful beautiful journey. Every episode of my life is like a dream, and I am at peace and happy with what life has given me.","Unless you have a real passion for making movies, then don't bother. I had to carry energy and light into every meeting, only to be told, 'We don't want you.' I couldn't take it personally. You just have to wait, and live for those moments when the casting director likes you.","Some may think fashion is frivolous, but the way I see it, when you dress well, you add beauty to the world. And there's nothing wrong with that, right?","I feel fortunate that I'm able to play diverse roles. I don't think everybody in Hollywood gets the opportunity to do that.","For me, it's hard to keep up with trends. I just go for the roles and movies that I feel I could add value to, or contribute to, that I feel I could portray.","When 'Mulholland Dr.' was voted the Best Film of the Decade, that was very meaningful for me. That film opened up incredible doors for me, and I believe that that was the reason I was given opportunities to play all kinds of characters."],"Laura Hillenbrand":["For me, being a writer was never a choice. I was born one. All through my childhood I wrote short stories and stuffed them in drawers. I wrote on everything. I didn't do my homework so I could write.","Fatigue is what we experience, but it is what a match is to an atomic bomb.","I have vertigo. Vertigo makes it feel like the floor is pitching up and down. Things seem to be spinning. It's like standing on the deck of a ship in really high seas.","But with nonfiction, the task is very straightforward: Do the research, tell the story.","My agent and I put out my proposal one Thursday afternoon in August, 1998. Publishers started bidding immediately, and that process progressed for a few days.","Having a lot of people suddenly depending on me to get the job done was a marvelous motivator. The book and movie deals seemed to flip a switch in my head, and off I went.","This disease leaves people bedridden. I've gone through phases where I couldn't roll over in bed. I couldn't speak. To have it called 'fatigue' is a gross misnomer.","For 'Seabiscuit', I interviewed 100 people I never met.","My illness is excruciating and difficult to cope with. It takes over your entire life and causes more suffering than I can describe.","I'm looking for a way out of here. I can't have it physically, so I'm going to have it intellectually. It was a beautiful thing to ride Seabiscuit in my imagination. And it's just fantastic to be there alongside Louie as he's breaking the NCAA mile record. People at these vigorous moments in their lives - it's my way of living vicariously.","The following Wednesday, I opted to go with Random House.","The biggest problem has been exhaustion. I've spent about 6 of the last 14 years completely bedridden.","Since signing with Universal, I have been working closely with Gary Ross, the director, producer and screenwriter. We have spent many hours on the phone, and I've been sending him information and items that have been useful to the writing process.","People think I must have been turning cartwheels on the night I sealed the movie deal - which was only two days after sealing the book deal - but I was really quite terrified.","My work was entirely nonfiction.","It only worked for a little while; the morning after I agreed to go with Universal, an article came out in the Hollywood trade papers, and the secret was out.","In terms of writing about horses, I fell backwards into that. I was intent on getting a Ph.D., becoming a professor, and writing on history but I got sick 14 years ago when I was 19. Getting sick derailed that plan completely.","I was starstruck and completely confused; making a film of this story hadn't even occurred to me, and I hadn't written a single line of the book yet. I had no idea how this man knew anything about my book proposal.","I think if I had been writing fiction, where the work is entirely dependent on the writer's creativity and the potential directions the narrative might take are infinite, I might have frozen.","I think authors can get into trouble viewing the subject matter as their turf.","I spoke to my agent and learned that a Hollywood scout had seen my proposal in one of the publishing houses, and had faxed it to Hollywood, where it was generating a lot of interest.","I look at the film as an opportunity to see some bountifully creative minds do something that I could not do - tell the story with images. I can't wait to see what they do.","I lived for four years in the 1930s with these individuals and the only time that I wasn't thinking about dealing with physical suffering is when I was working on this book. I've never been more alive as when I worked on this book.","I identified in a very deep way with the individuals I was writing about because the theme that runs through this story is of extraordinary hardship and the will to overcome it.","I had been writing professionally since 1988.","I am disabled, so I can't travel, and I have not been to any development meetings, but Gary and the others affiliated with the film keep me updated on everything.","I am actually in poor health due to chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome, and my ability to work is greatly diminished right now, so I have to get better before I can start another big project.","Honestly, I expected to get a cold reception because of my subject matter. But when editors took a look at the story I had to tell, and saw that this was not a parochial story at all, they really warmed to it.","Books on horse racing subjects have never done well, and I am told that publishers had come to think of them as the literary version of box office poison.","And at that point, I think my experience in covering the subject helped me. I think editors felt comfortable with the idea of me telling this story because I had demonstrated that I know this business pretty well.","I've used a cellphone exactly twice. Things move on. The world changes. And I don't know it.","I have to detach myself completely from aspirations. I hardly ever listen to music anymore because it arouses all of this yearning in me.","I got sick when I was 19, and I'd been a really healthy 19-year-old, so I don't have a lot to compare it to. Does it feel like the pain after you give birth? I don't know.","Most people, when they hear the disease name, it's all they know about it. It sounds so mild. When I first was sick, for the first 10 years or so, I was dismissed. I was ridiculed and told I was lazy. It was a joke.","I was 8 years old when I went across the street from my house to a fair, and they always had a used book sale. For a quarter I bought a book called 'Come On Seabiscuit.' I loved that book. It stayed with me all those years.","While it's really hard to do, at the same time, I'm escaping my body, which I really want to do. I'm living someone else's life. I get very intensely into the story, into the interviews and the research. I'm experiencing things along with my subjects. I have a freedom I don't have in my physical life.","Louie and Seabiscuit were both Californians and both on the sports pages in the 1930s. I was fascinated. When I learned about his World War II experiences, I thought, 'If this guy is still alive, I want to meet him.'","I'm attracted to subjects who overcome tremendous suffering and learn to cope emotionally with it."],"Laura Ingalls Wilder":["Home is the nicest word there is.","It is the sweet, simple things of life which are the real ones after all.","Remember me with smiles and laughter, for that is how I will remember you all. If you can only remember me with tears, then don't remember me at all.","Suffering passes, while love is eternal. That's a gift that you have received from God. Don't waste it.","Every job is good if you do your best and work hard. A man who works hard stinks only to the ones that have nothing to do but smell.","Once you begin being naughty, it is easier to go and on and on, and sooner or later something dreadful happens.","If enough people think of a thing and work hard enough at it, I guess it's pretty nearly bound to happen, wind and weather permitting.","The trouble with organizing a thing is that pretty soon folks get to paying more attention to the organization than to what they're organized for.","Her blue eyes were still beautiful, but they did not know what was before them, and Mary herself could never look through them again to tell Laura what she was thinking without saying a word.","A long time ago, when all the grandfathers and grandmothers of today were little boys and little girls or very small babies, or perhaps not even born, Pa and Ma and Mary and Laura and Baby Carrie left their little house in the Big Woods of Wisconsin.","Far worst of all, the fever had settled in Mary's eyes, and Mary was blind.","Wild animals would not stay in a country where there were so many people. Pa did not like to stay, either. He liked a country where the wild animals lived without being afraid.","The enormous lake stretched flat and smooth and white all the way to the edge of the gray sky. Wagon tracks went away across it, so far that you could not see where they went; they ended in nothing at all.","They drove a long way through the snowy woods, till they came to the town of Pepin. Mary and Laura had seen it once before, but it looked different now.","I always have been a busy person, doing my own housework, helping the Man of the Place when help could not be obtained; but I love to work. And it is a pleasure to write. And, oh, I do just love to play!","Everything from the little house was in the wagon, except the beds and tables and chairs. They did not need to take these, because Pa could always make new ones.","In the long winter evenings he talked to Ma about the Western country. In the West the land was level, and there were no trees. The grass grew thick and high.","Mr. Wilder says he would rather have me help than any man he ever sawed with. And, believe me, I learned how to take care of hens and to make them lay.","Pa did not like a country so old and worn out that the hunting was poor. He wanted to go west. For two years he had wanted to go west and take a homestead, but Ma did not want to leave the settled country.","So they all went away from the little log house. The shutters were over the windows, so the little house could not see them go. It stayed there inside the log fence, behind the two big oak trees that in the summertime had made green roofs for Mary and Laura to play under.","The path that went by the little house had become a road. Almost every day Laura and Mary stopped their playing and stared in surprise at a wagon slowly creaking by on that road.","But in the east the sky was pale and through the gray woods came lanterns with wagons and horses, bringing Grandpa and Grandma and aunts and uncles and cousins.","Mary and Carrie and baby Grace and Ma had all had scarlet fever. The Nelsons across the creek had had it too, so there had been no one to help Pa and Laura.","There the wild animals wandered and fed as though they were in a pasture that stretched much farther than a man could see, and there were no settlers. Only Indians lived there.","So Pa sold the little house. He sold the cow and calf. He made hickory bows and fastened them upright to the wagon box. Ma helped him stretch white canvas over them."],"Laura Ingraham":["There's a rule of thumb in politics. If you're at a point where you're complaining about the other guy being mean and unfair and uncivil, that's probably a sign that you're losing.","My mother told me when I left for college, 'Never forget your roots,' and I never have.","The more vile the thing that's said about me, the less it affects me. It doesn't bother me at all.","But to say that Sarah Palin and the tea party movement is responsible for vandalism or threats is just a way to dismiss the American people and, and their dissatisfaction with this health care bill.","In 2003, I wrote a New York Times best-seller called 'Shut Up & Sing,' in which I criticized celebrities like the Dixie Chicks & Barbra Streisand who were trashing then-President George W. Bush. I have used a variation of that title for more than 15 years to respond to performers who sound off on politics.","Well I think that what we're seeing now is that the people feel like they, the people in Congress don't have their consent to govern them. They keep doing things that are incredibly unpopular. And so when that happens, folks get angry.","Solutions-oriented campaigning with a little passion and a little humor; I think that will go a long way. I think people are desperate for it.","South Dakota is a great state because of its values, not because of dependence on government.","Incredible that liberals aren't more concerned about the monopoly of information in South Dakota.","Well I think that, if you want to look at polarizing people right now, I wouldn't look at Palin, I'd look at Barack Obama.","Our country is in deep trouble. To talk and re-litigate in 1998, or even what Mitt Romney said or didn't say in 1994 or 2002, I don't think most people really care.","I'm an equal-opportunity critic when it comes to left-wing celebrities sounding off on topics of which they know precious little.","If pro athletes and entertainers want to freelance as political pundits, then they should not be surprised when they're called out for insulting politicians.","We are a nation divided, but that's what makes us, in a way.","Watching AIDS play its evil game of give and take has made me understand why lobbying for increased research funding should be an urgent priority - not only for the gay community but for us all.","All the Left and the media attack dogs can dish it out, can't they, but they sure can't take it.","I hope that a lot of the men and women who feel forgotten in this country really see that they have in me a champion.","All the way back to Dartmouth, I was part of the insurgency.","I like Tom Wolfe's description of the country: There's America. The coasts are like the parentheses. In between is the country.","I wouldn't call it a Breitbart audience. I would call it America.","Friends frequently ask how I, given my politics, dealt with seeing my brother and his companion, Richard, together for the first time. They are surprised when I tell them it wasn't as unsettling as I had anticipated. Richard was smart, funny, kind, and clearly devoted to Curtis. They just clicked.","Hope is not the basis for policy. Wise policymakers analyze major issues such as immigration carefully and look at facts and probabilities instead of just hoping for the best.","Recent history shows that leaders in both parties are fanatics on the topic of immigration, and they cannot be trusted to effectively enforce any significant border measure.","The wise policymaker doesn't assume that any policy adopted in good faith will have good results. Instead, he or she weighs the likely outcome of any new policy based on facts and experience - not sentiments and dreams.","Among immigrants today, it is increasingly fashionable to reject American exceptionalism in favor of multiculturalism. To pretend that this isn't happening isn't optimism; it's sheer fantasy."],"Laura Innes":["I have a friend who is around my age, a little younger, and she's gay and came out to her own community when she was younger but not to her family and to the community at large.","It was sort of that in-between area when people don't talk about their personal lives. That's the kind of life I think Kerry would be living now if it weren't for the Lopez character sort of outing her.","Our intention is to really explore this transition and, beyond that, explore the particular things that someone comes up against when they're gay or lesbian.","I think they do a great job on Queer as Folk.","We've been back since July, but I spent some time with the family in the south of France over the summer. We rented a house with another couple and took it easy.","The thing with Kerry is that all of this is a natural progression, her troubles. It's a cycle.","The story line was done in a way that's organic and was doled out very slowly in little bites. We think that's authentic for this character, that her feelings are very deeply buried or she never felt them.","I'm straight and I have a lot of gay friends.","We try to be driven by what's a good story, what's truthful, and the drama of what happens next.","But I'm not objective when I'm acting.","And it's sort of an old-fashioned ER, in that it's very much about the medicine, and how these people cope. There's very little about the personal lives of the characters."],"Laura Kightlinger":["I always feel like rejection is my petrol. That's what keeps me going.","I really detest movies like 'Indecent Proposal' and 'Pretty Woman' because they send a message to women that sleeping with a rich man is the ultimate goal and really that's such a small part of it.","I love punching the ceiling with my fists when I'm lost or I can't find a parking space.","I used to think drinking was the only way to be happy. Now I know there is no way to be happy.","I want to be so famous that drag queens will dress like me in parades when I'm dead.","I have to find work wherever it might be hiding.","We've all made mistakes that are similar in just trying to get by or make some money or feel good about ourselves.","Women can really be who they are. I'm about to say the F word, feminist. Often that word has such a negative connotation.","I'm all over the place, and I consider myself a bit of a scrounger: 'What will I do next, so I'm not broke?'","I guess I just feel bad that I'm still going on bad dates when I should really be in a bad marriage by now."],"Laura Lang":["You can have anything you want, but not everything. If it was really important to spend an afternoon at my daughter's school, I had to think, how was I going to organize my life to do that? How could I become more efficient? I always tried to put my priorities on the table, personal and professional, and work around them.","To me, success in the job is setting a vision, guiding an organization through change - which is exactly what I did at Digitas, and I'm very proud of that - and bringing people together and with you. That, to me, is what it takes to be successful.","I'm not a Pollyanna; I'm a pragmatist.","Time Inc. has amazing titles - really great content.","In the broader sense at Digitas, I've been very involved in media and publishing.","I've always been about how will digital be transforming established businesses, and that's what I've done.","My mission is to become part of Time Inc. and push the business forward.","When I joined Time Inc., one of the things that was important to me was ensuring that our content is where consumers want to read it. The Apple newsstand is an important place where a lot of consumers are. And Apple is really becoming a good partner to publishers. We are confident we can deliver a experience for our readers that 's really good.","I'm very fortunate. I have a wonderful family, lots of hobbies and athletic pursuits. I always wanted to have a very well-rounded life.","Digitas is a company that's very rapidly changing - the digital world changes every day. It's important we hire people who are curious about what's going on and who are willing to learn and want to learn. I look for core leadership traits.","Early in my career, I sometimes found it difficult to make the tough people decisions - I had to learn that. In business, you want to listen. You want to learn. You want to make sure you're not proceeding without information. But if you wait too long, you can actually hurt an organization even more."],"Laura Leighton":["The kids can see that there are more parts to me than just being their mom; I wear a couple of different hats and have other roles to play.","I do think that 'Pretty Little Liars' has raised the bar in how social media can tie into the fan base watching the show.","I was on 'Melrose' at a time where we had to all go home and be there at the same time when the show was on, or set your VCR. But that was a big thing, and people of my generation still talk about that. They remember where they were, at what point of their lives that show came, and then talking about it the next day.","I think it's really important to remember that it's a long life, and it's a long career. In a perfect world, your career will be long. It does not begin and end with any one job. The point is to continue to have longevity in your career.","I think 'Pretty Little Liars' is going to be hugely popular for adults, for kids, for girls, for guys, you know, something for everyone to look at, and the stories are going to be great. There's suspense every week. The friendship is really fun to watch. I think it's going to have something for everybody.","On Christmas morning, we always make breakfast, and everyone eats before we open any presents. I make muffins and homemade applesauce, which I don't think anyone likes as much as I do... I just love the way it makes the house smell!","I plan on working out for the first part of the day, because if I let my day get away from me, the workout is out the window!","I try to mix it up! I do a little Pilates. I do a little Cardio Barre; sometimes I run or do the stairs."],"Laura Linney":["A magnetic personality doesn't necessarily indicate a good heart.","Tanning is tricky, because a lot of people just look orange.","Doing the right thing has power.","It's always nice when you do something and it's well received as opposed to the other way which God knows happens to everybody. When the good times come around, you take a deep breath, appreciate it, but not take it too seriously.","Traits like humility, courage, and empathy are easily overlooked - but it's immensely important to find them in your closest relationships.","It is always good to explore the stuff you don't agree with, to try and understand a different lifestyle or foreign worldview. I like to be challenged in that way, and always end up learning something I didn't know.","I'm absolutely doing what I enjoy.","Working with special needs children is hard.","I love to work in all sorts of different situations.","Some people's personalities are so compelling that they command attention.","Fear, anxiety and neurosis: that's just in the suitcase when you're an actor.","What I find so interesting about people is the choices they make, and how that effects their behavior, their sense of self and their relationships.","I can scarcely stand to have a manicure. I have to have them because you don't want to look like a disgusting human being - it's self-care and it has to happen, but I get very restless.","At school I was always trying to con my teachers into letting me act out book reports instead of writing them.","I don't consider myself a celebrity and I don't consider myself a star.","I grew up in Manhattan and, since my father was a playwright, all I ever wanted to be was a stage actress.","I have a bag with a toothbrush and toothpaste and all the things I might need during the day. I call the bag my trailer. Sometimes you don't have a trailer, so that's my trailer.","I've always thought that I'm sexy in my own right, but not in a way that people thought was bankable.","Just because you're not famous, doesn't mean you're not good.","The thing about death is that it's honest.","I think everyone's experience with a terminal disease is so deeply personal and unique to the person, the context in which they're living and the relationships that they have.","You have to relish the challenge of television.","For me to have the opportunity to stay with one character for, God willing, a long period of time, is really exciting.","The goal seems to me at times just to be business first.","I mean, the idea of losing a parent is really inconceivable. I think there's just an undertone of dread about the subject, so people don't talk about it and don't prepare for it.","I'm noise-sensitive. It's always better for me if things are quiet, so I can concentrate.","I think the way we talk about cancer has really evolved. I remember the way my grandmother used to talk about it, like a death sentence, no-one would even mention the word.","People's view of cancer will change when they have their own relationship with cancer, which everyone will, at some point.","Cancer is so much bigger than a TV show.","People can't really place me. They're not really sure who I am.","I don't think I'm exactly gregarious, you know. I'm not usually known as the loud person in the room.","The good thing is that I'm always honest.","I had a good imagination and I still have one; a child-like imagination that hasn't gone away.","It's very hard to put forth a film that's about love and the joy of love and for it not to be patronising and not make people nauseous or make them roll their eyes.","I love working closely with people.","History's a resource.","If there's one thing that I've done on purpose it's to take whatever job, so long as it's interesting and challenging, whether it's theatre, radio, TV or film.","My castings sort of go in phases. There'll be several icy professional parts - a lawyer or a cop. And then there'll be the intelligent-but-wounded group and then the period things. It goes in sequence.","Courtroom dramas can be boring.","You know when someone's over-flattering you in a way. You smile but you can't believe it.","I'm sure my father had more to do with my career than I would like to give him credit for. I would love to think it was all me!","I have an instinct to want to be part of a group of people. I feel safe there. That's why I was in school for so long.","What I hope in my ideal world is that with each project, I'll either get to work with a really great script that would force me to grow, or work with a really great actor who will make me better.","I had learning disabilities, and I couldn't express myself in the written word.","Comedy is a way to make sense of chaos. It's a way of dealing with things that are overwhelming, that threaten you; it's a way to survive and get closer to the truth.","I find the whole disdain for ageing crazy.","I don't want to spend my life in my 40s feeling bad about being in my 40s, and then all of a sudden I'm 50, and I will have missed a whole decade!","I enjoy learning about different periods and people, and then taking what's universal about the human condition and seeing where it matches up. No matter where you are, certain things unite everybody.","What I love about a play is that it's such an investment because only time can create a lot of what happens onstage.","I believe that no matter what you do in life, if you learn the basics through theater, it will help you in everything else - problem solving, communication, discipline, all of that stuff.","My experience is that's rare - that you have a script that is... what they call 'film-ready.'","I don't think you should exploit your own pain.","A lot of what is publicized now is really pretty trivial stuff - you know, what I eat for breakfast, where I have my pedicures, questions that I just cannot for the life of me understand why someone would want to know that.","When your life is being threatened there's an instinctive urge to fight. You fight for the time you have, for your relationships.","The entertainment industry is terrified of silence.","I'm not someone who likes to have my picture taken, let alone see it plastered all over the place.","I just have to concentrate on doing what I do.","What people can survive and what they don't survive is shocking to me. Someone can go to Iraq and be blown to bits and survive. Someone can trip and fall on the street and they die - that's that.","I crave a cone of silence every once in while.","All the things that most kids hated, I loved. I loved that things were asked of me and that, much to my surprise, I was able to do them. I loved the 10 o'clock bedtime. I loved the responsibility.","I've seen the greatest actors in the world, transcendent talents, who can't find a home.","I am very aware that playwrights, particularly good ones, have a intention for everything they write. Language and punctuation is used specifically, and most of the time actors can find wonderful clues about character in the rhythm and cadence of the language used.","I am very lucky, because for the most part people are very nice to me, and I am still able to go about my life and ride the subway and all that.","My parents were divorced and I would spend weekends with my father.","I love 70's music.","My family is from the South, and I can remember all those ladies I grew up with, like my great-aunts, who had handkerchiefs. There's something sweet about them.","I get cold - really cold - when I travel.","I'm very hard on my bags because I tend to carry a lot of stuff with me.","I certainly didn't have a nanny.","I hope that anyone I worked with wouldn't exploit our relationship.","I grew up in Manhattan on the Upper East Side.","If you have two parents who have to work, who want to work, you need to have someone to guide your child.","I'm lucky because I don't like being in the sun a whole lot, just because the repercussions for me - I feel it, I go very red.","Fame didn't happen to me in my 20s, it has been a gradual thing which probably makes it easier to deal with.","I could have gone to the gym for three hours a day and bought into all that, but I just wasn't interested.","I always laugh to myself when I listen to some really big A-list star saying that they are just a normal person.","I just want to say, 'Go work! It doesn't matter what it is. Work begets work. Just go!'","I tend to make low-budget movies but, yeah, I make more money than I ever thought I would make."],"Laura Lippman":["Anyone can love a perfect place. Loving Baltimore takes some resilience.","It's very different to have this kid that I'm truly responsible for.","I've gotten to do a lot of stuff, traveled, worked hard at my career.","I'm at the age most people are sending their kids off to college.","I think I'm part of a generation of crime writers all of whom woke up independently and recoiled with horror at the fact that we'd chosen this very conservative genre.","I think Baltimore suffers from nostalgia and it keeps us from being honest in talking about what really happened here. A place doesn't have to be perfect to be beloved, and I love this city and I love it better for seeing its flaws."],"Laura Marano":["Chilling out on the bed in your hotel room watching television, while wearing your own pajamas, is sometimes the best part of a vacation.","The best way to get to know the place you are traveling in is to walk around... and the best way to walk around is with comfortable shoes! Grab your travel buddy and your running shoes and go explore!","Every single person has the power to change the world and help people.","It's possible to look really cute and still be comfortable. You don't have to kill your feet to have a fashionable look.","At the prom, you are more about boys thinking you're cute. On the red carpet, you have to please everyone because there are a lot more people looking at those pictures.","Kids really have a lot more power than they think they have. They have the power to change the world. And they should know it.","I don't know about you, but I think blankets are the best, especially your own personal blanket.","What better way to expand your imagination than to read!","I am the biggest klutz on set. I honestly don't think I have ever been as klutzy as when I'm on set. People call me 'Grace' ironically because I'm not graceful. It's ridiculous.","When you are performing in theater, you feel so connected to your audience. It's exhilarating!","The only instrument I know how to really play, and the instrument that I absolutely love, is the piano. I have been playing piano ever since I have been 9.","Working on 'Austin and Ally' has been an absolute dream! We literally have fun every single day! Whether it's scaring each other or singing together or just hanging out in each other's dressing rooms, the cast and I are super close! I feel really lucky to be with everyone on our set!","Sometimes, the most daunting thing about performing is making eye contact with your audience, so just look above them and at the corners of the room. Soon, you'll totally forget they're there.","I'm pretty obsessed with Sara Bareilles. She is so talented, and I feel like I would learn so much from her.","If I saw my friend's boyfriend flirting with someone else, I would definitely talk to him about what I saw. I would want to give him a chance to explain. However, depending on how major the flirting was, I would probably mention it to my friend - just to let her know what's going on.","As a girl who was raised on the idea that we should give back to our community as much as possible, I believe that we have more power than we think when it comes to making change.","When I'm at school, I usually put my hair up. High pony, side pony, or a bun, I like my hair out of my face.","I'm so thankful for my family and friends - they're really supportive. Everyone I work with on 'Austin & Ally;' the cast and crew are like my family now. We have so much fun, and I'm so happy they're in my life!","To me, the most worrisome part of traveling comes before any of the traveling actually occurs: the suitcase-packing process. It's a challenging and anxiety-filled process - I am caught between wanting my suitcase to be light and worrying I am going to need every single item in my bedroom.","Inspire your children. I promise, your kids will think you're cool if you do this. They may not tell you that now, but they'll thank you later in life.","When I'm working I wear so much makeup, and when I'm out with my friends I wear makeup, so sometimes at school I'm just like, 'Today is not much of a makeup day - foundation, chapstick - done.'","I kind of have the most amazing fans ever. They are the most committed, passionate people, and I love them so much.","I'm a girl who loves shoes. There is nothing like the feeling of trying on shoes at the store and they fit perfectly.","I have a whole area in my closet for displaying shoes. They are in rows. But nobody comes in my closet, so they are only on display for me. It's pretty spectacular.","I'm kind of obsessed with wedges, but I go to a regular high school, so I'm not going to be wearing Vera Wang there."],"Laura Marling":["Age is relative. Experience is relative. And I think often intensity is confused with maturity.","I'm not religious, I'm not romantic and I live purely by logic. I make every decision by logic and sometimes that leads me to the right and sometimes to the wrong decision.","People don't appreciate music any more. They don't adore it. They don't buy vinyl and just love it. They love their laptops like their best friend, but they don't love a record for its sound quality and its artwork.","I've been quite fascinated by the relative insignificance of human existence, the shortness of life. We might as well be a letter in a word in a sentence on a page in a book in a library in a city in one country in this enormous universe! And that kind of fear and insignificance has kept me awake at night.","Now that I'm feeling the responsibilities of adulthood, the choices we make become an incredible weight.","It is quite hard to relax in London. I always say I'd move somewhere quieter, but I am a bit of a confirmed urbanite now - it crept up on me without me noticing. I always think that I function quite well on my own, unusually so, but then I'm reminded how important people are to me.","I never edit the songs that come out. And they tend to come out as a whole. The closest thing I have ever done to editing them is just cutting out a verse, but never rewriting lyrics.","I need some isolation, it's necessary to me, that's just who I am. I need to be left alone.","Womanhood is something you don't consider until it hits you.","I don't need to sell tons of records, but I want longevity. I want to make music for the rest of my life.","I just think of everything I do and how happy it will make me to do it. I don't like having my photograph taken, for instance, so I don't do that often.","You are what you can prove you've done. That's how people judge you.","I feel increasingly like age is very irrelevant. Quite often, cynicism is confused with wisdom, and my scorn is confused with a knowing, which I don't have.","I've noticed that, with many of the authors I like, I tend to think I would dislike them as human beings or that there'd be a healthy amount of debate if I ever did meet them.","I'd like to make music for as long as I can; it feels like something I need to do.","I feel sometimes that I'm in a constant state of being lost in translation, and I guess that why I write songs.","I feel like I'm creeping closer to finding the situation that triggers songwriting, which is obviously an extreme of an emotion.","I'd prefer to be good, but I'm not always. I struggle.","My reaction to everything in life is when it gets a bit complicated to water it down and make it simple again.","I'm reluctantly interested in love and helplessly interested in logic and yet they're so conflicting. And they're both necessary for a happy balance, a happy existence... I think.","I know there are lots of positives in the evolution of technology, but I also think it will be responsible for the end of a unique character, of a specific kind of geographical culture. The world is getting so small, and mass production is getting so big. Everything is in danger of becoming the same.","I'm a songwriter, and I understand artistic licence. We can embellish, go on little journeys and explore our inner selves. It can be quite self-indulgent.","I am slightly fascinated by the question of whether humanity is capable of change. I may have come to the conclusion that we're not, but we keep trying.","I'm a bit of a magpie: whatever I see or hear or read feeds into the songs.","My songs are not pretty. They're what I call optimistic realism.","It took a lot of time and practice for me to realise that there's no point trying to be something you're not.","I love the way you can fall in love with a piece of literature; how words alone can get your heart doing that.","No one starts playing my kind of music to make a fortune. But I do want to keep doing what I do and I do want to continue selling records. And I would, eventually, quite like some money.","When a song wants to be written, it will be written.","I'm incredibly neurotic and a control freak. I like the thought that if there's going to be anyone to blame it's going to be me.","I'm a lot more observational than personal in my writing. My writing is mostly a lot of questions without answers.","I get up, go and get a coffee, and go do the crossword - I'm loyal to one particular paper, the 'Guardian' - and that's my idea of a perfect morning.","I think your most intimate thoughts are only honest when they're in your head.","When I'm singing I feel like I'm talking to someone. I'm in conversation when I perform - either with myself or with whomever is listening.","All my songs come from me because I only seem able to write about myself and my experiences.","I definitely tell things at arm's length but that is conscious. No part of me wants everybody to know what's going on.","The romanticised life, where all the great poetry and music and art of the world comes from, is great but it requires a lot of self-indulgence.","I know how ridiculous this sounds because of the job I do but I don't believe in romanticism and make-believe.","I've always loved books by the Bronte sisters. I love Jane Austen, too. I'm more influenced by people like her than by pop culture.","People think I look odd onstage. But the way I deal with being incredibly nervous is by concentrating really hard."],"Laura Mennell":["Millions of animals are euthanized every year because shelters can't find homes for them. Buying animals from pet stores also tends to support puppy and cat mills, many of which have deplorable conditions for animals, which shouldn't be tolerated.","Learning about factory farms and their horrendous treatment of animals is what made me become vegetarian in the first place. I also support the education of the public on adopting pets from animal shelters or saving homeless animals off the street in lieu of buying them from pet shops.","Some of the best things about being a vegetarian include, of course, contributing towards the welfare of animals. Being a vegetarian can also make you a healthier person, and it helps the environment. All of these things make vegetarianism worthwhile. It's really a win-win situation.","I have odd thumbs that are extremely flexible. I can bend them quite far down the back side of my hand, basically the opposite side you'd even try to attempt bending your thumb. Because of that, I'm a very good thumb wrestler.","The harming of animals for any reason is shameful, but torturing them for mere vanity is senseless. Slaughtering animals for their fur or harming them for cosmetic purposes is disgusting and not worth the perfect shade of lipstick.","I'm definitely an animal lover, and I stand up for all animals' rights.","I was always interested in the arts as a child - drawing, painting, and piano - but acting became a favourite. I was a major theatre geek in high school - if I wasn't in the drama room at lunch rehearsing, I'd be in the art room finishing up some type of project.","The acting bug just seemed to stick with me. I loved going to theatre school in college and continued to train in film classes and had been auditioning for T.V. and movie roles since I was in my late teens. My career has been slow and steady, and I kind of like it that way.","I love the science-fiction genre because there's always so many endless possibilities! It's a limitless genre and can be fun playing around with otherworldly ideas.","I love going to theatres and seeing honest little indie films I know nothing about... being surprised by a beautiful film I had no expectations about but just got lost in. I'd like to do more well-written indies. I don't know exactly what my dream role will be yet, but it's somewhere within that realm.","I enjoy being in Toronto - there's lots of energy, lots of neat different neighbourhoods - but Vancouver is still home and always will be. I miss going for walks on the ocean with beautiful mountains.","I am still fairly new to the whole social media thing - I am definitely tweeting and Facebooking. It's a nice way to connect with fans.","I became a vegetarian at 15. I was always an animal lover and, as a teenager, became increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of eating meat. It was then that I started to research vegetarianism.","When I stopped eating meat, I fell in love with East Indian food - there's so much selection, and they use the most beautiful spices."],"Laura Miller":["In the year since we brought things into the open with a clean breath of fresh air at City Hall, we have learned about corrupt spending practices and unethical conflicts of interest that waste your money... and keep Dallas from being the great city of our dreams.","And we did it because it's time for City Hall to stop looking out for City Hall and start looking out for the people like you and me who are footing the bill.","But despite the challenges, I love being your Mayor.","But there is so much more to do for the city we love... a Dallas with roads as strong as our businesses, parks as beautiful as our children, a downtown as tall as our imagination.","Dallas is a great city, and it's worth fighting for.","Dallas is a positive, get-it done city.","From my very first day in the Mayor's office, I have worked closely with the Council members who share our vision of a city hall that really protects taxpayers and cares... yes... about the little things that make a big difference in people's lives.","Given the way some fought for the status quo when I authored the new Ethics Code and created the city's first Ethics Commission, we are going to need your strong support to get an even tougher Ethics Code passed this year.","If there's one thing I hope people are certain of it's this: I'm looking out for YOU - the taxpayer.","In many ways, our campaign this year will be the same as last time: We're still going to focus on fixing up basics and cleaning up ethics at City Hall.","It's wasteful spending like this that not only forces tax increases and cuts in vital services... but also really make you wonder: who is City Hall looking out for?","Now it's time to focus on basics for people in our neighborhoods... and real ethics reform at City Hall.","Others like City Hall the old way, when they could make deals behind closed doors with your tax money.","The city has to do what any citizen or family does, when you have a dream. You tighten your belt. You sacrifice some luxuries. Above all, you don't waste a dime.","There's still is a status-quo group at City Hall who likes things done the old way, behind closed doors.","Together, often by unanimous vote, the council has worked quickly to get positive results."],"Laura Moser":["Grit can't be measured on pop quizzes, but it can often predict long-term success more than mere intelligence.","You have to follow that next step.","The friends I knew who tutored were well paid for work that seemed far less grueling than waitressing or late-night newspaper copy editing or all the other side gigs I attempted in my early twenties.","Don't most of us agree that providing school meals to kids who need them is an overwhelmingly good thing? After all, nutrition is essential to proper cognitive development.","My grandfather arrived in Houston in 1942 as a refugee from Nazi Germany. He had lost everything - his profession, his language, his money - but the city welcomed him, as it has hundreds of thousands of immigrants over the years.","With our growing attachment to the online universe comes a refined ability to keep tabs on several things at once, to watch stories unfold on parallel planes.","I've always wanted to walk the whole of the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal, which winds 184.5 miles from Georgetown to Cumberland, Maryland.","The only lottery I've ever won was a $100 scratch-off card at age 16, and the 7-Eleven clerk who sold it to me said I was too young to claim my winnings.","I was a campaign widow.","My husband and I were married in May 2007 on a sprawling rent-a-ranch in the Texas Hill Country. On the drive from Houston, we'd stopped off for our marriage license in the former produce aisle of a Winn Dixie-turned-courthouse in San Marcos and from there drove off the grid.","Campaign widowhood totally suited me, and I soon began to suspect that our setup beat the bill-paying and bickering of an actual marriage.","I've basically worked as a journalist and a writer.","Very few of us can stop our lives and become activists.","If I'm not happy with what's going on, I try to change it myself.","Houston's one of the most diverse urban areas in the entire country, and most people here are really proud of that.","I married a man whose Hindu father grew up in the rural north of India and whose Jewish mother grew up in the Bronx.","As President Trump quickly moved to limit immigration, civil rights, and environmental protections, I felt fear for my young children, and guilt, too - as if I'd somehow betrayed the unspoken contract all parents make to give our children a better life than ourselves.","A big reason I'd spent my career as a writer and not a public speaker is that I am a person who refines my worldview in a silent room, waiting for my thoughts to arrange themselves on the screen before me.","The beauty of kids is they don't care who you are, which is why people like the Obamas like them so much - they treat them like normal people.","I had to work up the courage to even imagine myself running for Congress. But I eventually decided that our country had a moral problem in only letting white men - even the right-minded ones - have a seat at the table.","I believe in following opportunities.","Calling representatives every single day, arranging local community meetings, and marching in the streets every Sunday. It's not the path to glory, but it's absolutely essential to maintaining a democracy under threat.","In my career as a writer, I preferred to avoid current events: I wrote young adult novels and book reviews and lifestyle journalism about health and parenting and other such evergreens.","I don't claim any great experience or expertise.","If we all band together against extremism and spend a few minutes a day using tools that have been proven to work, we can make a big difference in defending those values we share as Americans.","I believe that if Democrats - not any one Democrat, and certainly not just me - want to start winning races again, Lujan's statement that the DCCC would fund candidates who oppose abortion rights puts our country in danger and makes it all the more likely that the Republicans will continue to defeat us in election after election.","Wishy-washy equivocations - and not just on abortion, but on immigration, on civil rights, on income inequality - weaken all of us.","It's a truism to say that my state, Texas, isn't a red state: It's a nonvoting state.","I have one idea of how to get more Democratic women to polling stations: Stand up for them.","There's a nastiness to conversations about U.S. education reform, which are characterized by the kind of stark taking-of-sides that's usually reserved for debates over guns or abortion rights.","Ohio has long been an embarrassment to charter-school supporters nationwide, with its trail of scandal and graft and abysmal student performance.","New York City has an integration problem.","Becoming a tutor was among the many attractive post-collegiate side careers I failed to pursue while devoting the bulk of my days to writing fiction.","We can all get behind feeding the poorest kids in school, right?","Diversity isn't just a hallmark of big cities anymore.","As more and more minority groups fill our nation's classrooms, what can we do to even the separate-but-forever-unequal playing field? Now that's a question many very smart people have spent decades trying to answer.","The celebrity's desire to shape the next generation of young minds by opening a school is by no means unique to Diddy.","I never experienced much outright anti-Semitism. While we learned about the Holocaust - endlessly, it felt like - no spray-painted swastika ever appeared on my childhood landscape. Jewish persecution was an ever-looming reality, but always an abstract one.","What role should religion play in the American public school classroom? My own knee-jerk response would be, 'none whatsoever,' but the Constitution isn't quite so direct on the subject.","In middle school, I had a teacher who regularly reminded students of the Monday night Young Life meetings he sponsored; on Tuesdays, he'd spend the first few minutes of class palling around with the chosen ones about all the fun and fellowship they'd experienced together."],"Laura Mvula":["'Green Garden' is about beauty and joy and lush green and dance and excitement and smiling from within.","I have a younger brother and sister who actually play in my band, and we were always into Disney music, big time. The first time I heard myself sing was when I recorded myself singing a Disney song. I remember it because it was awful, and I didn't expect to hear that. I think it was 'A Whole New World' from 'Aladdin.'","I like pastels and lighter shades on darker skins. I feel like it lifts everything and accentuates being chocolate.","I envy those who can wear red lipstick or any bold lip colour, really. My top lip just doesn't seem to take colour - there's nothing I can do to change that, so I usually just use a nude on the bottom lip.","I regrettably wasted time at university by being overwhelmed and intimidated by the talent of other composers. I felt stuck and didn't know what I was doing there. I enjoyed my experience, but I didn't grab it in the way I would now.","It's important for any artist - particularly female artists - to feel completely comfortable and to know what they're trying to do.","I love church buildings, particularly cathedrals, and I like living in spaces that remind me of music or evoke that creative energy.","I'm by no means a pianist. I think that's safe to say, but the piano, for me, I would say it's the enabler. It gave me what I needed and gives me what I need in order to write a song. And I think playing or improvising on the piano is where I feel most liberated and sort of less conscious of all my insecurities or inadequacies.","I think, when I started writing songs, my voice just became another tool. It wasn't something that I was going to try desperately to woo a listener. As long as I'm using my voice in a way that helps people understand what I'm trying to say, then I feel like I'm doing all right.","I don't think I always look in people's faces, like, as - I think especially when I'm doing my more intimate songs that are quite personal, I always feel it's a bit accusing if I stare in someone's face when I singing quite a personal lyric.","Being a pop star is something I don't think I'm very good at. I'm worried it's making me too paranoid, because all of a sudden, life has become this constant assessment. When you put something out there and people get to hear it, then those people react to it, socially, culturally.","I got into the habit of filtering out all the good in my life, focusing on only the negative. I'm not sure why I did it, but it's a pretty depressing state.","Taxi drivers used to ask me what kind of music I did, and I'd say, 'Well, it's kind of jazz, soul, classical' - but that makes no sense to anyone.","I thought I had to help people get me, but I don't think they need to be spoon-fed. If you connect with me, that is cool. I don't need the whole world to feel like I am a soul angel.","My parents encouraged us to commit to things, so if we wanted to learn an instrument, it was all the grades and all the theory.","There's nothing I love more in the world than layering voices.","I don't talk about Amy Winehouse as a 'singer.' She's a pioneer. I listened to her endlessly when I started writing.","I'm not like my siblings, who are musical but can turn their hands to other professions! I'd always wanted to be involved in music - I'm a great believer in doing things that fulfil you.","I listen to a lot of choral stuff at home, but I'm also liking Labrinth, Emeli Sande, Tom Odell and Wretch 32.","'Mvula' is my married name, but for some reason my nan calls me 'McVula.' I'm not sure if it's one of those jokey Caribbean things, or whether she's just getting it wrong.","If I'm playing a gig in London, it feels so important. The adrenaline rush here is bigger than anywhere else. I kind of like the pressure that London puts you under.","London audiences have this reputation for being a bit too cool for school.","I come from an African Caribbean background. I've been influenced by a reggae church music style, contemporary gospel, and rock all fused together.","I really love jazz, but I will never be a jazz musician as much as I dream. But, I think that the jazz music I love is there in my music.","If I'm uncomfortable on stage, everybody can see it. I'm not very good at hiding it. I like long, loose jacket dresses - anything that I can literally have room to move in - not that I'm a very big dancer, but because sometimes I'm sitting down at the keyboard, and then sometimes I'm standing. It just has to feel good.","I had a very thorough grounding in music; I'd grown up around songs. My parents listened to a lot of music. My dad was majorly into jazz, which was absolutely a big influence on me, even if it was more subconsciously as a kid.","My parents were quite strict; we couldn't just listen to whatever music we wanted. It was very much like they monitored what we listened to.","One of the things I haven't been ready for is how male-dominated the music industry is. I just didn't have a clue.","You don't have to aim to be the best of everything, thinking that one day you're going to be the top of the world; I don't think it exists.","I always start with emotion. That's where I start all of my improvisations, on the piano. I always start with the mood or the feel of where I am in that moment.","For me, a wake-up playlist completely depends on what mood I'm in. If I need to get into action pretty quick, it will be between Beyonce and Miles Davis. I'm a massive Beyonce fan, and all of her anthems will do it for me. And Miles Davis, because I grew up hearing his music because my dad played it a lot, so that will always be special to me.","I grew up playing in youth orchestras, so they were my most treasured memories, so to be in front of an orchestra playing my own material would be incredible.","I bumped into my cousin after she'd shaved her hair very short, and she looked incredible. She seemed so effortless and cool, and I wanted that. And, I've had it like that ever since.","I love my complexion, but like so many of us, in the early years at primary school, I grew up thinking that my dark skin wasn't a great thing. I've found freedom in music and songwriting, which has given me a freedom in how I present myself. I'm glad I've got makeup to celebrate that with.","Limitlessness is important for me; I want to be able to use every opportunity to push me forward onto the next thing.","I write songs from the heart, and I don't hold back.","Lizz Wright is my favourite singer. Her voice moves me and takes me to another place. She also grows her own food, and that inspires me.","What I wear is everything - from how I carry my hair to what I'm wearing on my feet. I have to feel comfortable on stage, so I like to wear things that have room. My mood changes a lot, so sometimes I wear 6-inch heels, and other times I'll perform in bare feet.","Topshop is one of my favourite shops, and I love shoes by Giuseppe Zanotti. There's a graduate fashion designer called Kate Falcus who makes me beautiful commissioned pieces - one of my favourites was the white Glastonbury dress she made me with the puffy skirt.","I respect hippos. They just look the way they do; they can't do anything about it, but they don't seem bothered.","I don't think I've ever been chatted up, and I don't think I've ever chatted anyone up. The Fresh Prince has the best chat-up lines.","There was always a piano in the house when I was growing up - my dad played, and I thought it was cool - and when I was eight, I begged my parents to let me have lessons. After a couple of weeks, I wanted to give up, but my parents were very focused and made me keep going, which I'm very pleased about now.","My songs are very personal, which means they are fantastically therapeutic to write, but performing them night after night is emotionally draining.","My aunt is the director of the acapella group Black Voices. I was so struck by them as a child. They sang with such passion and conviction. By the time I turned 15, I had plucked up the courage to ask if I could join the group. Acapella is a different discipline from singing with an accompaniment - it is much more exposed.","I remember listening to Miles Davis in the car with my dad. I had just done my Grade 5 piano exam, and I was quite cocky. I said, 'It sounds like he's played the wrong note there.' I remember the look of horror on my dad's face, and thinking, 'Wow, I have to figure out why that is not acceptable.'","Fame hasn't really affected me. I have a really close knit group around me, and my sister is always with me, so it's like a bit of a travelling circus.","I first played the Royal Albert Hall when I was 14. I was a violinist with the Birmingham Schools Concert Orchestra, and we travelled down from the Midlands for the last night of the School Proms. We played some pieces from the Harry Potter films, and the violin parts were really hard.","The first time I sang in church, when I was ten, the applause was so overwhelming that I started to weep. My mum had to rescue me from the stage.","Teaching was my first job after leaving university. It was a challenge, but I enjoyed it. Some of the kids were disruptive, but I could deal with it because I was only 24 at the time, and my own school memories were still fresh.","I've always had this passion to be creative, and wanted to sing or be in bands and make music, but I didn't have ideas as to what format it'd be, or how I'd do it. I'm not very good with plans. I didn't think it would be me at the front, either. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that was something I'd prevent.","Lots of people think I'm telling porky pies when I say how nervous I get about singing. I was good at working out how music was put together, and I was good at being at the back, but if you asked me to sing up front, then I looked like I was going to pass out.","I always said when I was younger, I wanted to write film music, and I think that's what my ultimate dream is."],"Laura Nyro":["As beautiful as simplicity is, it can become a tradition that stands in the way of exploration.","I don't think you should categorize yourself as an artist."],"Laura Osnes":["People say I have my own Cinderella story, and in a way, I guess I do.","That's the joy of getting to be an actor - getting to play all kinds of different roles and showing so many different sides of yourself.","I think knowing where you can generally fit is important, but the fun thing about being an actor is sometimes stretching beyond that stereotype and stretching beyond the box that people put you in.","'Carousel,' please! I would die to do that.","I don't have a gym membership. I usually do a bit of basic yoga or stretches at home or in my dressing room before the show. I've done plank for 60 seconds almost every day since 2009, when I had to wear a bikini onstage in 'South Pacific.'","If I can impact people with my music, that's what I want.","I was never like, 'Oh, I really want to play Cinderella.' That's not necessarily always been the dream. But it's super fun to play a princess.","I'm actually so low maintenance when it comes to my hair. It's naturally stick-straight, but I do like to use a curling iron to give my locks some life.","I've never dyed my hair or even gotten highlights. All the products I need for my hair are at the drugstore!","I'd love to do movies and be on TV. But I think if I transitioned into TV/film completely, I would really miss singing and dancing. It would be ideal to be cast in a movie musical!","Getting to do 'December Songs' in a cabaret-style format was so interesting because it's like a one-woman song cycle that actually tells a story. It feels like a theatrical experience more than a cabaret because I didn't talk in between. We went from one song to the next, nine songs in a row - bam - I told the story in half an hour.","Julie Andrews is so iconic, and I grew up watching 'The Sound of Music' - it's every girl's dream to play Maria, in a way, I think. That music!","I really have been so, so blessed with all my leading men.","I don't think I want to transition into being a recording artist for the rest of my life or anything like that, but it's something I'd like to try.","Oh, I am such a nerd when it comes to music - I only listen to Broadway!","Getting to perform at the Carlyle, following in the footsteps of women like Elaine Stritch, Barbara Cook, Christine Ebersole, Kelli O'Hara, and so many others, is nothing short of a dream come true.","I don't think auditioning will ever faze me again after the 'Grease' TV experience. It was fierce. There were thousands of people auditioning in four cities. I flew from home in Minneapolis to audition in L.A. I waited in line all day. I arrived at 7 A.M. and wasn't seen until 6 P.M.","I'm doing what I wanted to do since I was a young girl. I pinch myself every day to make sure it's true.","That's the ideal. Not to get stuck in a rut playing the same role.","Cinderella is making her Broadway debut. It's an honor to step into that position and, in that way, I am creating a role because it's never been done on Broadway. I feel so honored.","I was always a very good student, 3.98 GPA... But once I found out I only had to take math and science for two years, I didn't take them junior or senior year. And I convinced my high school to give me actual credits for doing professional shows in Minneapolis... as work-study.","'Grease' was my Broadway debut. That was eye-opening. At the same time, it was very familiar. It was a Broadway show, but it's kind of the same as doing a show in Minnesota. It's the same type of rehearsal process. You are doing 8 shows a week, but I worked at a theatre in Minnesota that did 11 shows a week.","'South Pacific' - I really learned a lot. I swear I like to say that during 'South Pacific,' I went from being a girl to being a woman.","'Bonnie and Clyde' was the first show and the first role that I got to originate. Being part of that from the ground up and investing three years of my life into seeing that show come to Broadway was really rigorous but also so exciting.","I've always wanted to be on an original cast recording. I grew up listening to them, and now to know that my voice is heard on three or four of them is just surreal. I never thought I would be that person.","I have to say that getting to tackle Maria in 'The Sound of Music' at Carnegie Hall was surreal. When I heard my voice, it was all I could do to keep myself from doing a British accent and sound like Julie Andrews!","As wonderful as being on stage is, family comes first.","Broadway has been my dream since I was 5 years old.","I was born in Burnsville, Minnesota, and raised in Eagan, which is right by Burnsville. I've been in that area my whole life.","I did my first show in second grade. I was a munchkin in 'The Wizard of Oz.'","My first Broadway show wasn't until I was a freshman in high school. It was my first trip to New York. I came with a group of theatre kids, and we saw four shows. The very first one was 'Contact.'","After high school, I went to the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point for a year, and I studied musical theatre. By that point, I was like, 'This is what I want to do.'","When I did 'Grease,' I took good care of myself. I treated it like a job. I approached it very professionally because I wanted to make a good reputation and hopefully continue on in the Broadway community and continue to do shows.","I found an agent midway through my year-long run at 'Grease' and just started to audition. I fortunately booked 'South Pacific' six months after 'Grease' was over, and I feel like that was a huge turning point in legitimizing myself in the Broadway community, and getting to do that was absolutely amazing.","If you can be a good example to other people, why not try to be that person? I have a bit of a people pleaser in me, but not so much so that it's out of control.","I let the whole 'Grease' experience be a springboard for me. I wanted to use the exposure I got from that very wisely to continue a successful career. It's taken a lot of work and perseverance."],"Laura Prepon":["My vintage Levi's are my favorite on the show, 'cause they really fit.","I never think of myself as any kind of sex symbol, but I get letters from all over, all sorts. It's really cool. I get a lot from inmates, which is kind of scary. But the best was the guy who wanted to send me a plane ticket to fly me to his prom.","I always have really fresh, hormone-free, additive-free chicken, healthy veggies, and brown rice in the fridge to grab because I'm always on the go.","Our poker table is eight guys, and then I'm the ninth; I'm usually the only girl at the table.","Free love sounds great.","You can always turn a bad kisser into a good one.","You can't control where your heart goes.","Every girl on TV, in real life, sure you want to meet that soul mate and fall in love and have the big thing, but until that happens, you gotta kiss a lot of frogs.","I am so like Donna it's funny. And most of my friends are guys too.","I love entertaining and doing Martha Stewart stuff.","Even in real life, I'd rather hang out with guys.","I'm the tomboy so I got to be a little butch.","I'm not a sun person.","I don't know how people recognize me.","I don't want to do anything like Can't Hardly Wait, I don't want to do anything like Scream. I saw all those movies, and they were good, but they're just not what I want to do.","And my mouth is not a sewer, although some people may think it is.","I love being a redhead. It's a rare thing, so I think there's a bond between redheads.","They have to be able to spark my interest so I want to pursue it, and they have to have an awesome personality, really laid-back. All those things are sexy to me.","I can't stand being around anal people, especially anal people with big egos.","I used to wear boxers and a tank top, but now I sleep in the nude. It's kind of weird, because I used to have to wear something to bed, whether it was a tank top or whatever. And now if I have any clothes at all on, it's really hard to get to sleep.","Some of the stuff that Wilmer wears is bad. And Debra Jo.","But, I swear, they're turning Donna into Annie Hall this season. More ties. More suits. But they're also keeping her really motivated, ya know? Like, wanting to be a rock journalist. Wanting to be the first woman president.","The fact that anyone would find me sexy is very, very flattering, but ridiculous. I so don't believe it. But I'm flattered. Truth is, I don't lift a finger to look sexy. Ever.","There's nothing you could say that would shock me.","But now that I'm a blonde, guys are so blatant about coming on to me.","People in general have a preconceived idea of what prison is, from seeing documentaries or whatever.","I've realized how important it is to have women in your life. You get to a certain age where you're like, 'I need women around.'","When you're not under a 'series regular' contract, and other jobs come up, you try to juggle everything.","Netflix is amazing 'cause they trust the creator to do their job, and they trust us to do our job. They're really smart and just let us do our thing and deliver a great job.","Networks, especially, micro-manage everything to death.","On a lot of shows that I've done, we had the same directors, which was cool. But then, it's also great to do shows where the director changes every week, because you get to see all these different personalities and see what you like dealing with better, as an actor.","For me, personally, I watch pretty much everything on Netflix, and I watch all the episodes in a row, when I can.","I'm obsessed with 'Homeland.' It's not even okay.","For some reason, I like to put myself in situations where I don't even know how I ended up there. I never want to be complacent or comfortable in a role.","Now that I know what goes into making a pilot, keeping it on the air, and keeping your fans, I'm at a point now where I do a pilot and just hope for the best. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out.","When you're in prison, and we're left to our own devices, you're stripped of everything, and you really get to see who these people are, the good and the bad.","In any character I ever play, whether she's good or bad or whatever, my most important thing is heart.","I like to think I'll just be walking down the street one day and stop and meet someone, like, 'Oh my God, you're awesome,' and then we start dating.","Acting wasn't even in my world at all. My oldest sister worked at 'Glamour' magazine and said I should model, but I had no interest.","My family was very unorthodox. My mother was very eccentric and amazing. She always treated us like adults.","I moved to Milan when I was 15. I was always looking for something; I never really felt like I belonged where I was, so I went to live overseas.","The first acting I ever did was an Italian commercial. Once I did that, I said, 'this acting thing is awesome.'","It's funny, I used to say on 'That 70's Show', you could really put us in any decade, and it was about the people and the characters and that we cared about each other.","The thing that sucks is that there's so much false data because people are in mystery as to what Scientology is, so they just kind of make up stuff.","I eat super clean and am always watching what I eat.","I'm the type of person that will do triple sessions in one day. I'll do Pilates, I'll do spinning, and then I'll go to the gym and do weights - which is insane.","The worst diets are ones that restrict your calories too much and try to trick your body. You have no energy, and it's ridiculous."],"Laura Ramsey":["I personally don't even try to compare New York and L.A. To me, they are just way too different.","I've always gone for the more sensitive, bookish guy, totally. The jock boys, the sporty guys, I don't know... they just didn't do it for me.","When you go in and guest-star on a TV show, they already have their family - everybody pretty much knows everybody, and everyone sort of has that base already formed.","Statistically, Portland, Oregon has the most street kids, like kids that run away from home and live on the street. It's like a whole culture thing there. If you walk around on the streets, there are kids living on the streets, begging for money, but it's almost like a cool thing. They all just sit around and play music and squat.","The Internet is so big that no one can control anything, really."],"Laura Ricketts":["We all have different perspectives on the world. I'm a woman. I live in Chicago. I'm gay.","When I was 5, I wore a tie, and I wanted to change my name to Larry, which probably tipped my parents off that I was gay.","I don't really like politics, to be honest. But it's other people making decisions about my life and my country and my child's education... I wish we didn't have so much money in politics, but that's not the world we live in. If we don't play here, we forfeit. And I'm not willing to forfeit my rights.","Being a woman and being gay is really a unique position in our society. I know in my experience of activism, oftentimes it makes a difference if something is women-focused. It's likely to get the attention of women much more easily.","My hope is that we will inspire more lesbians to get politically engaged. For too long, lesbian women have been left out of politics.","I think for a long time I wasn't really out to myself growing up in Omaha, Neb., to a Catholic conservative family. It took me a while to come out to myself, and not long after that, I came out to them. I think that it really couldn't have been a better experience. They were all immediately supportive."],"Laura Riding":["We live on the circumference of a hollow circle. We draw the circumference, like spiders, out of ourselves: it is all criticism of criticism.","There can be no literary equivalent to truth.","To a poet the mere making of a poem can seem to solve the problem of truth, but only a problem of art is solved in poetry.","Because most people are not sufficiently employed in themselves, they run about loose, hungering for employment, and satisfy themselves in various supererogatory occupations. The easiest of these occupations, which have all to do with making things already made, is the making of people: it is called the art of friendship.","I feel an intense intimacy with those who have this loathing interest in me. Further than this, I know what they mean, I sympathize with them, I understand them. There should be a name (as poetic as love) for this relationship between loather and loathed; it is of the closest and more full of passion than incest.","I believe that misconceptions about oneself that one does not correct where possible act as a bad magic.","The end of poetry is not to create a physical condition which shall give pleasure to the mind... The end of poetry is not an after-effect, not a pleasurable memory of itself, but an immediate, constant and even unpleasant insistence upon itself.","I am not 'in pursuit of truth.' It is not my 'quarry.' I am of my human nature a thinker, and conscious of need, responsibility of thinking-speaking with truth. I do not go about hunting 'truths.'","If you find something to tell, tell it to your truest, though that make little to tell; the truer you speak, the more you will know to tell.","Art indeed is a term referring to the social source and to the social utility of creative acts.","Poetry brings all possible experience to the same degree: a degree in the consciousness beyond which the consciousness itself cannot go."],"Laura Robson":["There's a puppy store near where I live. They know me by name in there because I go so often.","If I don't play well, then it's not the end of the world, because we all learn in tennis that there's always next week.","Getting pummelled is better than not playing anything at all.","I don't just want to be someone who hits the ball 100 per cent every time. You can play with freedom and still mix up the pace, mix up the spins and everything like that. That's what I want to be doing, because you get into that very one-dimensional kind of tennis if you don't work on slicing and coming into the net.","If there is noise against you, then you try to make it seem it is for you. You just have to try to focus on your own game and try and win the match whatever way you can.","I don't remember my first race, but I do recall various school sports days where I became way too competitive. We were seven or eight years old, and I had a very stern conversation with my relay team-mates about how crucial it was for us to win.","I played my first match aged six. Neither my opponent nor I knew how to score, so our parents had to help us out from the sidelines.","I generally don't use an iPod for track work, as I'm focusing on heart rate and times. When I'm in the gym or running alone, there's always music. If I'm in the weights gym, I usually go for rap or rock music; for running, it's dance or cheesy pop.","I think there are so many phenomenal runners. I grew up watching Cathy Freeman, Kelly Holmes, and Michael Johnson, so I'd say they are my favourites."],"Laura San Giacomo":["There are amazing schools and amazing educators that are doing a wonderful job. And then there are a lot of educators that are not prepared to deal with inclusive education. They haven't been trained. It's really quite lovely and easy when you understand how to do it.","For all of my fortune, there are many with misfortune that need a hand.","I went to college in Pittsburgh at Carnegie Mellon University... studied acting there. Then I went to New York for about five years. I moved out here about 10 years ago.","I did theater at Carnegie, and in Pittsburgh and New York.","I have a son, Mason, who is disabled - cerebral palsy - and he does not walk independently, sit independently or speak. He uses a talking computer. I started becoming an advocate for him when he was 3 years old.","The world is changing and the physical barriers are down now. It's time for the emotional barriers to go down. And what better place to start than school?","We've all had those moments where we take a person for granted.","It's fun to get really intense and emotionally detailed and complicated.","Certainly situation comedy is harder than people who are good at it make it look, but it's fun to do something different.","I'm a bit of a layman physics junkie. I don't really understand it, but I love trying to understand it.","I knew that I wanted to be an actor. Then it became about whether acting wanted me. So, I gave it a shot. It hasn't worked out too bad, so far.","I believe in giving back.","I am willing to lend that hand, I will continue to stay involved with my charities as long as they need me."],"Laura Schlessinger":["When you're the victim of the behavior, it's black and white; when you're the perpetrator, there are a million shades of gray.","Don't worry so much about your self-esteem. Worry more about your character. Integrity is its own reward.","Well, I'm a Harley Babe.","I'm kind of a jock. I sail, I ride a bike, I hike, I pump iron. I just love to be active.","Oh, well, there's a difference between privacy and secrecy.","Values are principles and ideas that bring meaning to the seemingly mundane experience of life. A meaningful life that ultimately brings happiness and pride requires you to respond to temptations as well as challenges with honor, dignity, and courage.","On the Day of Atonement, Jews are commanded to seek forgiveness from the people we have hurt.","One thing I've been happy as peach pie about - because I'm all about the children and the happiness of a woman because that makes the happiness of the home - is that nannies, day cares and babysitters are all collapsing, which is forcing moms and dads to raise their children at home.","My life is what a salmon must feel like. They are always going upstream, against the current.","It amazes me that talking about traditional values is controversial, but it seems to be.","I pretty much preach, teach and nag.","Children are our second chance to have a great parent-child relationship.","It is typical of women to fester and ferment over disappointments, slights, annoyances, angers, etc.","Men are very emotionally dependent upon women from the day they are born to the day they expire.","I love revenge.","When you live in a condo complex with people next door, I don't know how you can be dead for four months without anybody noticing you not coming and going.","Gay activists claim that because I don't subscribe to their political agenda, I am a homophobe, meaning I have a mental disorder - because that is what phobias are.","There are so many ways to talk with the people who appreciate my help.","We all get self-centered.","Kids who don't have moms suffer a lifetime.","I think it was much better when you got on your horse and rode two miles to talk to your neighbor.","This is all you have. This is not a dry run. This is your life. If you want to fritter it away with your fears, then you will fritter it away, but you won't get it back later.","If you're a liberal, anything you say is protected. If you're a conservative, anything you say is hateful.","I want to regain my First Amendment rights.","I want to be able to say what's on my mind and in my heart and what I think is helpful and useful without somebody getting angry, some special interest group deciding this is the time to silence a voice of dissent and attack affiliates, attack sponsors. I'm sort of done with that.","I've made the decision not to do radio anymore.","I climb mountains.","I'm very active, wild woman.","My sister is not a public person, so I don't think it's right to discuss her.","I am married.","I'm not cynical.","A typical complaint of married women with children is that their job stress tired them out so that they have little quality emotion and energy left for their children, much less their husbands.","Children are not a right, they are a privileged obligation.","When men or women make their work their top priority and become hostile to the normal, natural needs of their children and spouse - obviously, something is wrong.","Research indicates that most women want their man to earn more than they do.","Women seem not to understand, or underestimate, the profound power they have over their husbands.","Frankly, too many women treat their husbands as accessories instead of priorities.","Radio is in my blood.","For a long time, I was a career woman and that was it.","The feeling of your baby taking nourishment from your body for the first time is amazing, and it remains the most touching moment of my life.","I was in college in the '60s, and the whole feminist movement had swept me up.","We all have to make choices in life.","Once the kids are in school, it's amazing what you can do.","Some people seem to see compassion as being mushy.","Psychology doesn't like to talk about evil. It likes to talk about bad childhoods. But I very much believe that some people are evil and motivation is not necessary for evil.","Losing a child is probably the singular most horrible thing.","My mother isolated herself from all family and friends for some 20 years. And never met her grandchild, my son.","I'm not surprised by hardly anything anymore.","Well, the truth is that a lot of people lie about their health, they lie about the finances, they lie about things at work, they lie about things.","We all do stupid things.","Everything I say is true.","Women view men like houses. They look for fixer-uppers.","People from the most horrendous of childhoods can have good lives, but it comes down to a very seemingly simple word. 'Choice.'","I'm involved in so many different things, and there are so many profound reactions to what I do because I am big counter culture.","There are probably more internet hate sites about me than Charles Manson.","It's humbling and enthralling to know your legacy when you're alive.","I've got a full life.","I really am a woman at peace.","I'm kind of an antsy person.","Guys are very simple.","I talk every day about doing the right thing.","If you're that hypersensitive about color and don't have a sense of humor, don't marry out of your race."],"Laura Slade Wiggins":["I did community theater in Georgia and called myself a ballet dancer.","When I was in high school, we used to do 15-20 hours of dance per week, and then when you graduate, you don't have that much time on your hands anymore.","I did 'Shameless' on Showtime, and I felt like I really tried to go super-method with that, and it would just make my days really hard to get in and out of character.","You should always care about what you're eating because it's your body, and you should always want to eat healthy foods, but dieting tactics in Los Angeles are really confusing. There are so many different weird diets out there.","'Shameless' was such a weird time in my life because I never really experienced any kind of role that put me that much in the spotlight before."],"Laura Spencer":["I graduated from the University of Oklahoma, and I got the opportunity to take some on-camera classes while I was in school and met a casting director who informed me quite a bit before my move out to L.A.; it made L.A. feel possible, coming from Oklahoma and not having a family that was in the industry.","When you get to the point where you know the material so well and you know the character so well that you can just sort of play off of whoever your reader is - that's the best feeling at an audition.","Auditioning is an entirely different part of what we do as actors.","You could give the best audition ever and not get the role or not get a callback because you just weren't what they were looking for."],"Laura Trott":["You don't know how good you are until you actually get out on a bike and get riding.","I can get really nervous before a race. People will think this is mad, but sometimes I have got to the start line and thought, 'What if I can't do this?' But the minute I sit on the bike, I am like a different person.","Cycling has never felt like a job. To get paid for something that you absolutely love is amazing. I don't feel like I work. I just do it because I love it and I get paid to do it. I just think: 'What an easy way to earn a living.'","It's nice to actually look done-up, because people see a different side of me, the more girly side. Obviously, I can't do that with cycling. I can't go with nice girly hair and full make-up.","I don't feel like an idol to anybody. I don't feel anybody should look up to me.","Cyclists need to help themselves and should not jump red lights. I would ride in London, but I certainly wouldn't ride like that; you just have to be careful. I can understand going down the outside of traffic, but you should obey the rules of the road because we're all road users.","I don't like the road. I love being on the track. I like being indoors and the fact I'm not battling past 200 other riders.","I think when I first started cycling, it wasn't that popular with kids. I felt almost embarrassed going down the road on my road bike; I didn't want my friends to see me because it was embarrassing.","I was thinking on the rollers today that, before a race, if I could just pick my brain up and put it on the side of the track for four minutes, it would be perfect.","I said back in 2010 when I was rubbish at the European championships, 'If I never win an omnium until 2012, I don't care.' I then won Olympic gold.","For 10 days after the Olympics, I couldn't go back to my house because people were sitting outside waiting to take my photo. That was a bit rubbish. At first I was open: 'Yeah, of course you can take a photo...' but after a while, it got to the point where I thought, 'Whoa, I don't like this attention anymore.'","My mum was my inspiration. As cliche as that sounds, she was the reason that we started. She chose cycling to lose weight. I was only eight at the time, so I just followed what my mum did.","People find it hard to fit exercise into their working-day life. Nine to five jobs take up most of your day, so it's always difficult. But a little can go a long way. It can literally be 10 or 15 minutes of exercise that can be of real benefit.","The best way for women to get into cycling is to go out in a group, to feel like you're part of it.","When I first started out in cycling, if there were two girls there, that was successful; but now, if there are 20 girls there, it's just unbelievable. The growth of the sport is just incredible.","I get asked to comment a lot on inequality in cycling, but for me it has never been an issue. Everything has always been equal on the track, and the male and female riders are all part of the same team, and we all mix freely.","For all the benefits of being in the public eye, there is the odd downside, too. Twitter goes mad sometimes with people saying weird stuff. It is a bit strange, but you can just ignore them. It is not even worth getting worked up about.","Elimination race is my thing. I really enjoy that event.","I wasn't really taught about the value of money. I just learnt it as I grew up, but I do remember my dad telling me that it was important to always have some savings, and that stuck with me. I've always believed that putting money aside is a good thing.","I never really had a job, because I've been cycling from such a young age: there was never really a time to have a job. My mum went into Starbucks once and asked if they had a job for me, and they offered me one - but I never took it up because I couldn't fit the job in with school and cycling.","I've been asked to do 'I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!' and I do get asked to do all sorts of things like that - but I don't want to put my career on hold. I'd have to take three weeks off to do something like that. Maybe it's something I'd think about after it's all ended.","Cycling was the sport of our family - we did it all the time, five days a week.","I am very superstitious. I trod on a wet towel before winning the Junior World Championships, and now I have to do that every time.","It's all well and good having a women's Tour de France - which I think we need and I think we should have. But I think we should slowly build it in and not just go 'Bam!' with three weeks over the same course and same length of time as the men's."],"Laura Vandervoort":["A lot of people think that reptiles don't feel, and they do. I think everyone should keep in mind what it is they are buying and if it is really worth it to them.","I've done a lot of sci-fi, so I was a little hesitant because you get pigeonholed into that genre and world. But at the same time, I love sci-fi because the women are so strong and independent and smart.","I grew up doing martial arts, and I'm a second-degree black belt.","I always do my own stunts, as much as possible. I'm a little stubborn about it.","I don't necessarily want to know what people are saying when I'm not around, especially if it's about me. I just don't need to hear extra garbage.","I started doing martial arts when I was about 7, and I got my second degree black belt when I was 19. So I have my second degree black belt, but I've never used it, and I had to stop when I got 'Instant Star' because I couldn't train.","I don't know what it is about me. I don't know if there's something strange... but I continue to play aliens, so there's obviously something there.","I still want to do a romantic comedy or a western or a gritty independent film... there's so much that I still want to do.","I've played such serious characters that no one sees me the way I actually am, which is completely cheesy and goofy, so it would be fun to do a romantic comedy and just have a good laugh.","Hollywood is something imagined... acting is something crafted."],"Laura Wade":["Writing a tribe is fun. They have their own language, their own slang; they repeat it, and it becomes part of the texture of the play. For a writer, that's thrilling. That's when my pen flies.","A fascinating breed, Old Etonians. Impeccable in their social skills and very portable - you can put them anywhere, and they are absolutely charming.","I'm always drawn to writing things that feel like uncharted territory.","In my final year at Bristol University, I wrote a play called 'White Feathers.' It was produced in the studio theatre at the students' union in early 1999, when I was 21. It's 100 pages long: a very traditional play, with an interval, about deserters in the First World War.","And I admit it: there's a rather dirty thrill when 700 people laugh at a joke you've written.","Apparently the show happens even if I'm not there. Who knew?","It's an odd mix, the life of a playwright.","I don't like writing with real people in mind.","I was the family alien. Both my parents are quite creative, but I was... appalling... always putting on little shows. I was rather a shy child, not a natural performer, but there was a performative edge to everything I did.","'Posh' is not really political. I didn't want to aim a brickbat at the system. Or to bash Old Etonians. It was always the class and privilege aspect of that world that I was most drawn to. There is something endlessly fascinating about imagining something you could never be involved in.","I think a lot of playwrights have a script in their bottom drawer that hopefully no one will ever see about a bunch of young people sharing a flat and getting up to crazy stuff.","Your plays are always personal. You can't help seeing yourself in the serial killer you've just written. But they get less specifically personal.","Old Etonians are the most charming people in the world. It's not just the analytic ability and the great education; there is a really easy confidence to them that draws people to them and makes their passage though the world a little easier.","I think it's disingenuous to believe that being born into a privileged world means you feel like you are having an easy time.","It's not a meritocracy until everyone starts with the same opportunities, is it?","If you want, you can have a coffin made out of cardboard or wicker or papier mache. There's one like a seed pod, or you could buy one that doubles as both a bookcase and a coffin. During your life, you stand it in your living room, and then after you die, the books are taken out and your body put in their place and the whole thing buried.","I really don't know where my interest in death comes from. Maybe I've just got a twisted imagination. The truth is, I haven't had a hugely eventful life - maybe I'm compensating in my creative life. Or maybe I'm just a bit sick.","I am interested in the way advances in medicine and palliative care mean more people now have the opportunity to plan their own deaths, and also plan for those who are left behind. What does that do to the grieving process?","Maybe if I'd had more direct contact with death, I wouldn't find it so fascinating and I wouldn't write about it so much.","I'm not posh at all. I grew up in Sheffield but never managed to pick up the accent - which was careless because there'd be some cache now in being a northern playwright, but I missed out on that one.","I think the interesting thing about the word 'posh' is that it is so relative; it's quite a provocative title because people have strong feelings about that word.","Whether you like the look or not, that tailcoat is a tough shell, a suit of armour. The posh boy is a hardy species.","Quite often, little germs of ideas have come from something that I've observed or someone's told me. The process of it becoming fiction is expanding and extending it: stretching the rubber band of reality.","I'm not very good at sticking at things if I can't be successful at them. I gave up on sport a long time ago.","It's very lucky to be able to do a job where I get to sit about writing plays all day and going to the theatre. The downside, I suppose, is that you put it out there, and people are invited to like it or loathe it.","I think theatre at its best looks into the dark corners; clearly, my dark corners are full of doom.","We're not going to create a more equal society by not prodding at it, are we?","I think we love watching rich people behave badly. It has a sort of grisly fascination for us."],"Laura Wasser":["Once you do embark upon the separation or divorce process, it is very important to remember three key things: Be kind, be reasonable, be brief. Remember that this person will no longer be your spouse, but he or she will continue to be your co-parent, family member, and perhaps business partner in certain assets or entities.","In seeking a lawyer, you are looking for an advocate, an expert advisor on the law and on your rights and responsibilities, a strategist, a negotiator, and a litigator.","Sometimes, just the act of venting is helpful. Counseling provides a safe haven for precisely that kind of free-ranging release: You can say things in the therapist's office, with the therapist present, that would be incendiary or hurtful in your living room.","Do I believe in coupling? Do I believe in commitment? Do I believe in co-parenting, raising children together, having a family, and growing old with someone? I absolutely believe in all of those things. I just don't believe that you need to be married to do that. I love going to weddings, though. I do love a good wedding.","My dad once said that in criminal law you see terrible people on their best behavior; in family law you see great people on their worst behavior.","Dissolution and custody matters are the great equalizers. Having done this for a while, you do realize that everybody has the same issues. It doesn't matter how much money you have or how much power you have, you are always afraid you're never going to see your child.","As a society, we've evolved, and we've recognized that the American family structure has undergone enormous changes. Divorce is all around us, and who among us doesn't know someone who is divorced or has been impacted by divorce. It's not as scandalous as it was.","I don't try to be sexy, but I do want to look as good as I can.","Just as you go to the gym regularly to keep your body fit, regular couples counseling can keep your relationship fit as well.","Just about every therapist or counselor or social worker is practiced in dealing with people going through failing relationships, ending them, and confronting issues of custody and support.","You don't want to move in with someone and find out that they don't have auto or health insurance. That's a rude awakening.","I don't know that human beings were meant to mate for life or be monogamous. But, for me, the aspect of marriage that is troubling is that it's a contract that is governed by the state, and I don't want the state to have control over my personal affairs.","Evening bags should be just big enough for my phone, lipstick, house key, and credit card.","The rarity is the sudden epiphany or single turning point showing you with dramatic clarity that your marriage is over, although that does happen. Most relationships hover on a precipice for years before one party or the other finally decides it is time to jump, and coming to the decision isn't easy.","I think it is really important that people at least have some potentially difficult discussions about what their expectations are - and not just financially - prior to getting married. It should really even happen prior to people living together or casting their lot together.","If some people try to make a prenup into a pre-negotiation of a divorce... Well, that's really sad. But I do think that it's important to understand what each person has coming into the relationship, and what each person expects from the relationship. They aren't always fun discussions to have, and they can be very eye-opening.","Conversations about money certainly are not sexy, but they should give each of you some clarity and enable you to enter into your marriage with a better understanding of each other and what is important. Work and home responsibilities, joint or separate accounts, budgets, etc. are all subjects which should be discussed.","Generally, there are no lightning bolts or magical signs that tell you when it is time to get divorced. When the bad starts outweighing the good on a consistent basis, you may feel that taking the next step is appropriate. It is a very personal decision and most likely should be arrived upon with the help of some kind of counseling or support.","Like the marriage contract you entered into, your divorce is a legal transaction. Treat it that way. Try not to let emotion, hurt, fear or anger dictate the circumstances of your discussions or negotiations.","If one person is spending all of their income on clothes, travel, hobbies, and entertaining, and one person is saving it, that may not be quite fair if and when you guys split up, depending on what the law is and what you decided to do.","A woman - even if she is the primary breadwinner - really needs to keep in mind that at some point, she may have a diminished earning capacity because of the fact that she will bear children. Of course, this is case by case. I had two kids, and it didn't really slow me down at all.","I think if you're going to be in a relationship with someone, you need to be able to share the responsibility, the knowledge, the worry. It's not like it was when our parents or their parents were having lives where the mom just baked bread, and the husband worried about it, and the wife didn't know there was any problem.","To find a pool of lawyers from whom to choose, solicit referrals from other professionals you know or deal with - an accountant, banker or business leader. Check out Bar Association listings as well, and don't neglect Internet research.","There is probably no such thing as a good divorce, but clinging to an old idea of how relationships are unraveled can make a bad thing even worse.","For me, I don't participate in the filming when I represent a reality show star in a case, because that would mean waiving my right to attorney-client privilege, and that would hamper my ability to mount an effective case.","The only thing that's different between high profile or celebrity divorces is that you have to do all you can to keep your client and the details out of the media.","I'm not a divorce monger by any means, but if you're not happy in a relationship, and you've grown apart, it's not healthy for a couple to stay together. It's better for kids to see two happy parents than two miserable parents.","Everybody should get married - once. I was 25.","I'll tell you, I never thought I'd ever be going into law, and certainly not the same kind of law as my dad.","I represent celebrities, but I am not a celebrity.","I'm known for having crazy shoes. I have a total Napoleon complex - I'm only 5'4\", and every heel I have is four inches or more.","My go-to jeans are old Levi's I've gotten from boyfriends; they're worn-in and really yummy and perfect.","Many states favor joint custody.","One client's wife managed to steam the labels off all of the several hundred bottles in her husband's prestigious wine collection, so the collection was worthless. The husband hosted 'What's that wine?' dinner parties.","Especially where financial matters are concerned, when it comes to dissolving a marriage, any dissembling at all is strictly against the law - on penalty of perjury. You need to disclose fully and factually, which is precisely what the discovery process is all about.","There's something about sitting face-to-face with an attorney in an office that enables people to come to grips with the very idea of divorce - or to reconsider the idea. Like a number of my colleagues - not all - I offer that preliminary consultation for free.","Couples counseling gets many couples back together. But not all, and not always. For your own sake and that of your children, however, I recommend it - I almost insist on it - as the first step for anyone unhappy in a relationship."],"Laura Wilkinson":["There's nothing like overcoming something that scares you so much. Nothing feels better.","I love chocolate chip cookies - really anything with chocolate will do!","I was vegetarian for a long time, and in the last four years I started eating chicken and fish. I feel like it really built up my strength a lot.","I love overcoming challenges and fear.","Fear has been a big battle, it runs rampant in my sport so I love to overcome that, to challenge it head on, because there is nothing that feels as accomplished as overcoming a fear, and something that has blocked you in such a big way.","There are a lot of eating disorders in our sport, so I try very hard not to get consumed by all that.","The women are stepping up their degree of difficulty more than the men. A lot of us do the same dives as the men now.","I definitely want to win a gold medal, that should be everybody's goal.","I want to do my hard dives really well, I want to see what my true potential in this sport really is. I want to grasp that.","I think there's nothing that can drive you more than a huge dream or a huge challenge."],"Laura Z. Hobson":["I grew up in an agnostic broad-minded family.","I think of myself as a plain human being who happens to be an American."],"Laura Ziskin":["I describe myself as someone who was always putting on a show, even when I was a little girl. I wanted to be an actress but I liked organizing everybody and putting on plays. I was a producer.","What's great about making movies is the sort of additive process of bringing people together and having an idea and watching the idea be added to and at the end you have this thing.","For me as a filmmaker, I do the projects I'm really excited about.","You know I'm proud that I was able to develop and produce movies that I wanted to make.","I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004.","When I was diagnosed I didn't know how epidemic cancer was. You find out that everybody you know is touched by this disease."],"Laurance Rockefeller":["Individually, people are finding that a simpler lifestyle provides greater satisfaction than relentless pursuit of materialism.","I am of the opinion that the appreciation and the desire for what is good takes more study and insight than does the understanding and test for the best music and art.","I profoundly feel that the art of living is the art of giving. You're fulfilled in the moment of giving, of doing something beyond yourself.","I do not believe wealthy candidates should spend vast resources in their own campaigns."],"Laure Manaudou":["In Athens I was 17 and I didn't have any expectations. I was just swimming fast and racing everybody. I didn't have the joy after my races in 2007. I didn't want to go to Beijing. I had to for sponsors.","There have been some hard times, people around me supported me.","Even if I flop, I still qualified for the Games, and that was my goal. My target was to be at an Olympics for the third time with people I like."],"Laurel Clark":["Hello from above our magnificent planet Earth.","It's such a long mission and we get to spend so much time in space... we're doing such exciting research. And I don't want to overemphasize the life science research, but as a physician the life science research that we're doing is extremely exciting.","There was a moth in there, and it still had its wings crumpled up, and it was just starting to pump its wings up. Life continues in lots of places, and life is a magical thing.","Other than motherhood, the eight years that I spent at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, I have incredibly fond memories of. It's a beautiful place, with four seasons up in Wisconsin. And really wonderful people.","As a physician, I understand how important it is to collect data on people so we can understand what's happening with them. I will be in the position to help enable that knowledge.","I've always enjoyed traveling and having experience with different cultures and different people. But it's also a wonderful thing to be able to benefit and enable research, not only in our country but around the world.","If you're trying to get someone who's sick with a fever off of a submarine and it's cold and raining outside, the only way in and out of a submarine, generally, is through a fairly narrow hatch.","We're looking at Earth science, observing our planet. Also space science, looking at the ozone in the atmosphere around our Earth. Also looking at life science. And on a human level, using ourselves as test subjects.","Life science research can be done on multiple platforms. Since we have a very small number of people flying into space, the more people you have, the better.","Science, for hundreds of years, has spanned the differences between cultures and between countries.","I feel blessed to be here representing our country and carrying out th research of scientists around the world... I hope you could feel the positive energy that beamed to the whole planet as we glided over.","We trained for a lot more malfunctions than any ever happen.","The microgravity or the very, very low amount of gravity that we have up in space forces some changes in different processes. It forces changes in us as human beings.","We'd like to have immediate answers to all of our questions. I think medicine in particular. I found it frustrating as a physician sometimes to not be able to tell someone exactly why something was happening to them. There are still so many mysteries in medicine.","There's a lot of different things that we do during life that could personally harm us and I choose not to stop doing those things.","Everyone that I've talked to who's been to space has thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and what you often hear them say is: It was great, but we just had to come home.","Gravity is one variable in a lot of scientific processes. If you can remove gravity or minimize its effect, then you can understand the other processes that are going on.","Gravity pulls our bodily fluids down, like water in a glass goes to the bottom part of a glass. In space, the water doesn't stay in the bottom of the glass. It distributes itself evenly over time throughout the entire volume of the glass.","I have a computer screen near my seat where I monitor the overall health of the vehicle and pick up any problems that might be occurring early on or once we see any kind of a malfunction or anything unusual that's happening, we can look at the data and figure out what that is.","Some things are only capable of being done in space. Examples of that are looking at our Earth from that far away, and understanding the entire processes of storms and weather patterns, and oceans, and coastlines.","Things are going very smoothly. As expected, there are some minor glitches, and the eight minutes that it took us to get to orbit, we trained months and months for, and didn't have to use any of that preparation, other than being aware and ready.","Certainly my parents were a huge influence. They always expected the most out of all of us. And expected us to do our very best. I'm thankful to them for allowing me to do what I wanted to do.","I can't think of anything specific growing up that pointed me toward NASA at all. I was interested in the Moon landings just about the same as everyone else of my generation. But I never really thought about being an astronaut or working in space myself.","I can't think of anything that's as exciting as I'm sure this mission will be, and actually being in space. But, we did some training as a crew together.","The Navy's paid for you to go through school, and then they need doctors to go out and take care of people who are in various different parts of the world. I decided to pay back my time first as an undersea medical officer. I was stationed in Scotland.","There are some very significant changes in the way the fluids are distributed in our body, the way our heart functions initially, and as well as our bone and muscle.","This has been a great experience for me. The first couple of days you don't always feel too well. You adjust to the fluid shifting, how to fly through space without hitting things or anybody else. But then you get in a groove.","We've had such thorough training, we've had an excellent team on the ground. With the minor glitches that have occurred, we've been able to take care of them. And the teams on the ground are getting tons of incredible data.","When you talk to crews that went to Mir or have gone up to International Space Station, they say that you go through different phases of adaptation or getting used to the space environment."],"Laurel Lea":["A personal offense is like a scratch on a phonograph record. I couldn't move my thoughts beyond my pain. It kept repeating, as if I were stuck within its grooves. There was only one way to play beyond it. I had to forgive them, so my heart could take its form again.","I want the privilege of guiding the arrows of my children and giving them the exhortations that can shoot them into the high place.","It was my dream that I had clenched in a fist of discontent and wouldn't release. But time had now pried every finger open. There is peace in an open and upraised hand that isn't grasping for anything.","A disease and its treatment can be a series of humiliations, a chisel for humility.","Humor has always been important to me. If there is a shield of faith that you can keep up against difficulties, humor is the Teflon coating.","I've traveled to 50 countries, but I've never been to heaven."],"Laurell K. Hamilton":["You'd think a sociopath assassin wouldn't have a fan following but he does.","Like most creative people I don't fit well into boxes.","I feel that if you are blessed, or lucky enough, to be doing well, you should help others.","I think that my vampires in general were influenced by my being allowed to watch the Hammer vampire films. Vampire Circus, also shown as Circus of Fear, was one of those movies.","Everyone spends their lives trying to balance their world between good and evil.","One of my rules is never explain. A writer is a lot like a magician, if you explain how the trick works then a lot of the magic turns mundane.","I wasn't like most girls.","I want a kiss to be so believable it gives the reader shivers.","Two things I do well in books are sex and violence, but I don't want gratuitous sex or violence. The sex and violence are only as graphic as need be. And never included unless it furthers the plot or character development.","I'm more influenced by my own interests than anyone else's. Writers have to entertain themselves, or they can't entertain anyone else.","I try not to worry about rewriting books that worked well the first time. I'm too busy writing new books to worry about things that are already in print.","I always treated writing as a profession, never as a hobby. If you don't believe in yourself, no one else will.","Readers respond to every genre intensely, if it's a genre that appeals to them. Again, who can say why anyone enjoys horror and dark fantasy? If I can't answer the question for myself, I wouldn't dream of trying to answer it for others.","What we prefer to read is sort of like sexual preference, you like what you like. Most of the time you have no clue why.","My writing style is very sensual, as in sensory detail.","When sex is necessary for the plot of a book, or a character development, then I don't shy away from it. Why should I?","Never argue with your characters; they know themselves better than you do.","If people would write exactly what I wanted to read I wouldn't feel so compelled to write myself.","You either mellow at 30, or your head explodes - take your choice.","The fey in this country keep to themselves, and are a separate nation, much like the American Indians, but with even more autonomy.","Some people just don't seem to understand the concept of fiction. It is fiction; it ain't true, folks.","I am a very linear thinker, so I write beginning to end. I write hundreds of pages per book that never make it into print.","My characters surprise me constantly. My characters are like my friends - I can give them advice, but they don't have to take it. If your characters are real, then they surprise you, just like real people.","If I'd been easily discouraged, I could have been a one-hit wonder.","I've lost track of the number of people who want to be writers but never actually write anything. Talking about writing, dreaming about writing, can be very fun, but it won't get a book written. You've got to write.","I am not a morning person.","Here's the secret to finishing that first book. Don't rewrite as you go.","Perfection is an unattainable goal. It isn't going to be perfect. Just get words down on paper, and when you stumble to what you think is the end of the book, you will have hundreds of pages of words that came out of your head. It may not be perfect, but it looks like a book.","I cannot say how strongly I object to people using other people's writing as research. Research is non-fiction, especially for horror, fantasy, science fiction. Do not take your research from other people's fiction. Just don't.","I love animals, always have, and it seemed natural to help the ASPCA. Animals have no voice of their own, so we have to be that voice.","Now that I'm being very successful, publishers are trying to mainstream me, but I'm unabashedly genre. It's what I like to read, what I like to write.","I like conventions. I like meeting and greeting. I'm perched on that edge where I'm getting more attention than I quite know what to do with, though.","I started off like everyone else does, slogging but having a compulsion to put words on paper. I didn't write or read horror or fantasy, other than children's fantasy, until I was in my teens.","I think like a detective.","Most of the monsters... are based on some sort of mythology. Every culture and even some geographical areas have monsters and mythology that is their own.","I'm not terribly fond of soapboxes.","I've been writing stories since I was 12. 'Writer's Digest' was one of my writing teachers, actually.","By 17, I was submitting to publications and collecting my first rejection slips.","I went to Marion College for writing and I was kicked out of the writing school. I was asked to leave the writing program because I was corrupting the other students.","I guess, what I'm saying is that when I've been this surprised by my own characters and world, all bets are off.","If you're open to it, New Orleans will teach you about yourself, but if you want to hide from who you really are, the city will help you do that, too.","What happens in Vegas may stay in Vegas, but what happens in New Orleans, goes home with you.","For me the Anita series is built like a mystery series, which means that as much as possible each book stands alone, so you have a mystery to solve from the beginning to the end of the book.","You give the reader a sense of a full meal.","Nothing wrong with making money or doing what you need to do to sell, but I think it shows when you're writing something to pay the bills and when you're writing something because it's really your version of the world.","It was just you had to be strong, and if you weren't strong you're a victim and you're not going to make it. That was the reality when I was growing up."],"Lauren Alaina":["The first thing I do every day when I wake up is thank God for letting me make it through the night and giving me another day of life - just because sometimes I wake up, and I cannot believe I'm doing what I'm doing. I just thank Him. I don't know how I deserve it, but it's completely because of Him.","Before I go to bed, I thank God for blessing me with all the things he blessed me with, and for my family to be safe.","Self-confidence is something I've always lacked in. But finally, at some point, I just decided to be honest.","I didn't lose. I got second. That's still winning. How could I be unhappy with second place? There are a million people who would love to be in my position.","I was 15 on the show, and I cried a lot. I was homesick, and was so worried, that I didn't think of being on 'American Idol.' I was so worried that I was going home every week that I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have.","People are pretty because they're nice, and they care about other people, and they have a good heart. That's what makes you pretty, and I didn't know that at one point in my life.","I want to be the girl who has a positive influence on people's lifestyle. I don't want to be the girl who has an eating disorder, and that's why she looks the way she looks.","I don't like fake people.","It's all about, no matter where you come from, that you can be who you want to be and achieve what you want to achieve. I want people to learn to love who they are. Because that's the hardest thing in life, being able to see yourself the way other people see you.","I don't think that anyone was trying to keep me from writing the first album. It's just when you're on 'American Idol' or a TV show like that, you wanna capitalize on that momentum, and you want to use that to your advantage, obviously, so the best way to do that is to get the music out as fast as possible. And there's no time to create, really.","I had bulimia for a few years. I was really sick. I don't know that person; I can't believe that was me.","Honestly, I never thought I would ever tell anyone that I had an eating disorder. It was my deepest, darkest secret.","When you go through really hard times, you really figure out who you are, how you respond to things, and how things affect you.","No matter what decision I make, I want people to know that there's a reason I made it, and it's because it was something I felt like needed to happen. I don't want people to think that I've just gone crazy.","I don't have those superstitious ticks that people have to have something for the road. I like to have good food on the bus, my own pillow, and onesies. Onesies are a must.","I just feel like in society and in public, we have this unspoken expectation that we're all trying to meet. And there's so much pressure to try to fit in.","I write about what's on my mind. It's like a stress reliever.","It's so interesting how you can take a bad situation and make a great song out of it that somebody else can listen to and have a completely different perspective of the song and have their own meaning. That's what's great about it.","I like having curves. Curves are in!","There's just as much positivity as there is negativity, but for some reason, people focus on the negative things. And I used to be that person, but I'm not that person anymore.","My first kiss was in 7th grade. It grossed me out. I kind of freaked out!","I got really tired of fighting who I am, and I did that for a really long time; I was trying to be this perfect girl, perfect family, perfect body, and those people aren't real.","I want that to be my overall message - that we just need to love each other. We need to love other more.","I would see these people calling me 'fat' and calling me horrible names. And this one page called me 'Miss Piggy,' and they only referred to me as 'Miss Piggy.' I was a 16-year-old girl. I did not know how to deal with that, and I was already insecure about my weight.","I like to sing in the car with the windows rolled down and hair blowing all over my face.","As a little girl, I remember always wanting my grandmother to make blackberry cobbler for me. I'm obsessed with it.","I think everyone needs to mind their own business.","My favorite type of music to sing is a crossover between country and pop.","I hope each week I grow and impress you guys and make you happy.","I hope I'm exactly what America is looking for, I don't know, I'm just going to be myself and hope that they love it. That's all I can do.","I knew Scotty was going to win. At the beginning of the episode, I was like, 'Scotty, are you ready to win?'. I knew he was going to in my heart. I accepted it. I couldn't pick a more perfect person to get second place to. He's my best friend.","He might be my boyfriend. He might not be my boyfriend.","It is a horrible feeling to have people bashing you online.","I grew up eating fried food. I thought that macaroni and cheese was a vegetable.","I live country songs every single day of my life, so thank goodness I decided that was my passion!","I wrote 'Road Less Traveled' to make myself feel better and process what I was going through.","My mom made me look in the mirror every day and say three things that I loved about myself. At first, I couldn't name anything. It was so sad. When my mom made me do that, I looked in the mirror, and I literally couldn't name one thing that I loved about myself.","There are so many people who have eating disorders or who body shame themselves every day or have some sort of insecurity, and I feel like I have a direct reach to some of those people.","I had really bad polyps on my vocal cords, and I've had them since I was a kid, but the bulimia made it 10 times worse. They were bleeding constantly, and it was straining on my voice. And just the lack of nutrition - my vocal cords couldn't keep up because I was so unhealthy.","The first time I heard 'Georgia Peaches,' I absolutely loved it.","I don't want to be the young girl that people say, 'Man, that Lauren Alaina girl, she's got a lot of talent, but she's lost her mind.' I don't ever want that to be me - ever.","I really, really look up to Carrie Underwood a lot because she came from a small town that has the same population as mine - 3,500 people.","I have insecurity problems like every teenage girl, but you have to work through them.","You have to accept yourself so everyone else can.","When I started working all the time, I started eating the right food that will help me have my energy up and stay healthy.","To see your dad cry is like - It's different than to see your mom cry, you know?","I don't think I'm being forced to grow up too fast; I would rather people treat me like an adult.","I always put God first.","My parents got divorced, and they both remarried other people.","My dad didn't know that I had an eating disorder. He had no idea, so that was weird. I was in an interview and just said it accidentally. I called my dad because I remember thinking, 'My dad does not know that,' and he was surprised. I think he understood, though.","'Doin' Fine' is a really special song because it's uplifting but really honest at the same time.","I just want to inspire people to love other people and be accepting because I feel like there's so much going on in the world, and there's so many pressures, and there's so much negativity.","I don't take myself too seriously, or I at least try not to, and I want to encourage other people to live that way because it's a much better way to go about your life.","I got to express myself in a whole new way as a different person on camera, in a different way as an actress, and I loved it.","I didn't realize when I first started writing how much it would set me free from certain situations in my life. It's incredible.","I just desperately wanted to be thin. That's all I thought. I was obsessed with it, which it was ridiculous because I had everything going for me. I was following my dream. Everything I wanted at the time, I was getting. But I was obsessed with this other thing that was making me unhappy.","I try to remind myself of the things that I like about myself that make me who I am.","I really feel like I found myself, and when I found myself, I found the music along with it.","I think my favorite artists are honest artists, and as a songwriter, that's what you have to do. You have to be willing to put yourself out there in a really vulnerable way.","A lot of my fans are young women that are my age. We're all going through the same problems at the same time, so I just tried to be really honest with that.","I'm a huge country music fan, and there are so many girls that I look up to, especially Carrie Underwood, which everyone knows because I've shouted it out for a while now.","I'm not fake, and I don't want to mislead people about who I am. I can be serious, too, and I cry a lot. It's just who I am.","I won't change who I am for anything.","I love to go to school. My favourite subject is math, and I'm - actually, I just love high school more than anything, probably.","I love acting. I want to act as much as I can without interfering with the music.","There were blogs that called me Miss Piggy. It's a really hard thing to see as a teenager, especially when you already have problems. Reading what people had to say about me online definitely made it worse. People can be vicious.","Shania Twain and Martina McBride and all these wonderful women were saying that it's awesome to be a woman, and it's awesome to be a confident woman. Obviously, I could never compare myself to them, and I want to be my own thing, but I think that message is what I want to say as an artist.","I've never acted, but I'm an entertainer. So I kind of used what I know from being onstage. I've done a thousand and two interviews, and I've been on camera a million times, so I'm not uncomfortable on camera, but it was interesting for me to be someone else.","'Pretty' is not the amount of makeup on your face or the shirt you're wearing or the size of your pants - that is false.","For whatever reason, people just like to come out and say whatever they want to say about you when you're on TV.","I'm still learning to love myself.","When I first heard my song 'Georgia Peaches' on the radio, I opened up the car windows and started screaming to the other people on the road, 'My song's on the radio!' Of course, I wasn't driving.","I meal prep when I'm traveling and make sure to have three solid, high-protein and low-carb meals a day with a few snacks in between. But I try not to be too hard on myself. At the end of the day, it's all about having a healthy balance.","I think we're all insecure about something, but there's a way to deal with those emotions healthily by seeking professional help earlier on.","Remember that it's okay to get help, and it doesn't make you weak.","I remember my doctors examining my vocal cords and asking if I had an eating disorder, and I instantly said no. But then my mom, who was in the room with me, said my name in her 'mom voice,' and I just lost it. I didn't realize that she knew or that anyone knew.","My mom quit her whole life and came to live with me in California.","I keep the people who I know love me really close.","I don't let people say mean things to me! I don't surround myself with people who'd want to do that.","I've always dreamed of doing a music video.","I want to write with Taylor Swift!","I've been really fortunate with touring and sales and all those things because I have such a loyal fan base.","I had five singles that did not work on country radio, and I still had fans that showed up to the shows.","I don't mind if people say I was on 'American Idol,' because I was, and that is a part of my past, and I'm super proud of it, but I don't want that to be all there is to me.","I want to be happy. We all want to be happy. I want to be treated like a normal human being, but I also want to be on stage in a fancy dress, so I'm trying to find a happy medium.","I was 15 on American Idol, and everybody had something to say. It was like I had my really awkward phase on national television, you know?","No matter where you're from, what you've done, who you are, what your family's done, it's like, you cannot be healthy without love.","As a 15, 16-year-old girl, someone messaging you on Facebook and telling you you're fat is devastating. It's still devastating when someone says something horrible about me, but I love myself so much more as a person.","I'm a goofball, and I have this huge personality, and I used to try to hide that. I used to try to kind of dim my light.","People always ask me who my role models are and who I want to be like, and I don't wanna be like anybody; I wanna be me. I look up to a lot of people, and they have had great influences on me, but I wanna be original and different.","We all have our things that we go through, and I wanted to be an artist that people could listen to and feel like they're not alone. I want to be empowering.","I want to make people feel good about who they are regardless of who they are or where they come from or the color of their skin or what their family acts like or what they look like. I am all about acceptance of others and of yourself.","People would say to me, 'Who do you want to be as an artist?' And I would just look at them because I didn't know.","My mom married a family friend, and my dad married someone that's eight years older than me, so it was just like, these - like, I literally live a country song, so I had to write one.","I like any song that can tell a story that people can relate to.","None of my friends act any differently towards me, which is great. I was scared about that, so scared about that.","I had to learn correct portion control. I eat an egg-white omelet for breakfast, shrimp and veggies for lunch, and chicken with asparagus for dinner.","My mom would walk through a fire pit for me, and I'd do the same for her.","I was slightly starstruck by Justin Bieber! I mean, he is cute!","I love performing with a band way more than a track, just because it gets a whole new kind of vibe going and gets the energy up. You actually get to play off of the other people that are around you.","I've always been interested in acting - since I was a little girl.","I've got people around me that let me know when something really good happens.","Country music's really good about telling a story, so I want songs that tell good stories where people can say, 'That happened to me!'","I was really fearful that I was going to lose my record deal. It's really scary as a female to not have that success early on in your career, 'cause you don't know how many chances you are going to get.","I took some of the hardest things about my life and wrote an empowering song with it. It has made me want to always write from that place.","I was raised really religious, and it's a big part of my life. No matter what I go through, my faith will always be there."],"Lauren Ambrose":["Right now I just want to chill for a while. Take a hiatus from all the craziness. To clean my house, see my family. Just see some movies and pick some strawberries.","I never thought about being on a series before. It seemed like such a big commitment. But I love going to work every day. This is not about ego, it's about work, and that's refreshing in this town.","Having my son, I mean, I feel already that it makes me a better actress. Just the feeling and the love that expands in my being is more than I ever thought possible.","I came to L.A. to work and become a better actress, not to be a star.","Being an actress is similar to trying to fit in with the popular kids in high school. You're expected to drive the right car, wear the right clothes and say the right things.","I saw 'Food, Inc.' last night - it was like a horror movie. I'm definitely thinking about my food supply now and how I want to grow my own.","Yeah, I've always sung, and I always try to find a way for music to be in my life.","The idea is that we're doing it just for the joy of the actual physical experience. We may record something just for the fun of it, but the idea is just to be truly joyful and truly fun, especially for me, because I take myself too seriously all the time.","We played one warm-up gig at this bar that was kinda like that bar in 'The Blues Brothers' with the chicken wire. This place called The Brick House, in Housatonic. I really can't believe we're going to play for people in New York City. I'm terrified, but it's a small enough room. But it's really just supposed to be for the fun of it.","I think I need a little break. I've got a two-year old. I'll be part of The Leisure Class for a while."],"Lauren Ashley Carter":["It's important to always do your best work, no matter what the film is.","I'm a horror movie fan; I'm an avid fan and have been since I was five years old. My father and I watched horror movies, so this is a genre that is very close and very important to me.","There's a certain joy in taking a dramatic narrative and then adding that element of horror to it.","In elementary school, I was always writing little plays for my friends to be in. I was much more of a director than a performer.","Auditioning is a lot of fun for me.","I love film very much. It's very special to me, and seeing how it all turns out is always just a magical moment for me.","You always feel pressure to do your best, and when you know that the story revolves around you, it can become very overwhelming.","I'll continue doing horror until the day I die. I love it; it's so much fun.","Being on a low-budget film is difficult enough, and you may as well be working on something that you really believe in and you really love, and for me, that's to play different characters, to play different roles, and challenge myself.","I'm a huge Jackie Chan fan, and my boyfriend is Taiwanese, and he doesn't like to read. He had this Jackie Chan book, and I was asking him questions about him, and he didn't know, and I said, 'What do you mean you don't know? You have the Jackie Chan autobiography right there on the bookshelf!'","I always tell people, 'If you say you don't like horror, it just means that you haven't found the right movie.'","'Imitation Girl' is a feature written and directed by Natasha Kermani. She's one of the founders of Illium Pictures who co-produced 'Pod.'","Ruth Gordon was such a delight to watch in 'Rosemary's Baby' after I had first seen her in 'Harold and Maude.' And Ellen Burstyn is a hero of mine from 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,' The Exorcist,' 'Requiem For A Dream.' These women impacted me greatly as an actress.","'Pod' was a significantly larger crew with Ilium Pictures co-producing. 'Darling' was bare bones. We had less than half of the crew that we had for 'Pod.'","I want to make movies that I would want to watch as a fan.","'Hellraiser' was the first horror film I ever saw, so it will always be a favorite.","Whenever I write, I write very dialogue-heavy things because I love to force my characters to interact with one another.","For horror movies, it's great because I know exactly what I am doing and what should be done. But for a cop drama, I can't calm my face down, and so it's really nice to be able to be in this genre where nothing is too much, and no one yells at me for having big eyes.","I have to be vulnerable to allow myself to give the best performance I ,and that doesn't stop in between takes, and it doesn't stop when I am finished for the night.","With the performances, I have been very fortunate to pick things and to find scripts that I really love. I always try to do something that I haven't done before.","I try to keep myself busy creatively; it's for my own sanity after auditioning in the city for bad television shows and bad scripts and not being a name and having the clout to get my tapes passed on further.","I love comedy. Comedy is one of my favourite things to do.","When I do theatre in New York, I typically only get cast in comedy.","In real life, I'm a large character, and I need the space and platform to be large.","I did attend a convention with the production company behind 'The Woman' and 'Jug Face,' and I loved it and thought, 'I have to come back, as they are so much fun!' But those tickets are really expensive, and you're buying merchandise, and you want autographed pictures with people, so it's kind of like Disney World.","I remember on 'Jug Face' working with Chad Crawford Kinkle, who is as sweet as they come. He told me someone had given him advice that if you're making a drama, you basically need to put your main protagonist through living hell in every scene, and then you'll have a successful film. He laughed it off until watching me every day!","I've always said if you're comparing movies to music, then horror would be the black metal of the categories.","It's kind of wild for me any time anybody says, 'I love this movie with Lauren Ashley Carter. I'm going to watch all her other movies,' because that's exactly the way I feel as a fan of other actors.","I grew up watching Sean Young films with my father; we've always been huge fans of hers. A surprising fact is that she loves to work on comedies, which was great for me to hear, because then I could ask her a million questions about 'Fatal Instinct,' which was a VHS I wore out from the video store.","Angela Bettis - I can't say enough about her. She is just an incredible presence. She is very petite and soft, while she still has this power that floats around her.","A little bit of neurosis is OK as a performer, but untethered, it can tear one apart.","There are awful things that happen, dreams get crushed, you build yourself back up again, and then there are, hopefully, incredible partners in misery that say, 'Let me help you. I've been there before.'","Sean Young is such a sweetheart and just absolutely lovely. From day one, she was just very easy to be around. She's definitely a 'mom' and very much a girl's girl. She likes talking about makeup and the business and just being a woman.","When you're the good guy in a horror film, you're usually suffering a lot throughout the entire thing.","In theater, one of the biggest problems when you're rehearsing comedy over and over again is that you stop laughing at each other.","I don't have much power to make many films, but I do have the power in what roles I choose."],"Lauren Bacall":["You learn to rise above a lot of bad things that happen in your life. And you have to keep going.","Imagination is the highest kite one can fly.","I am not a has-been. I am a will be.","A woman isn't complete without a man. But where do you find a man - a real man - these days?","Stupidity is not my favourite thing; I cannot deal with it.","When you talk about a great actor, you're not talking about Tom Cruise. His whole behavior is so shocking. It's inappropriate and vulgar and absolutely unacceptable to use your private life to sell anything commercially, but I think it's kind of a sickness.","I studied dancing for 13 years. And loved to dance. Always wanted to dance with Fred Astaire.","I am essentially a loner.","Legends are all to do with the past and nothing to do with the present.","When everything happens to you when you're so young, you're very lucky, but by the same token, you're never going to have that same feeling again. The first time anything happens to you - your first love, your first success - the second one is never the same.","Looking at yourself in a mirror isn't exactly a study of life.","I suppose there are times when I can't believe that I've lived the way that I have and done the things that I've done. Life's a joke anyway. It's all ridiculous. It's all so short.","I think your whole life shows in your face and you should be proud of that.","I put my career in second place throughout both my marriages and it suffered. I don't regret it. You make choices. If you want a good marriage, you must pay attention to that. If you want to be independent, go ahead. You can't have it all.","We live in an age of mediocrity.","You can't always be a leading lady.","Stardom isn't a profession, it's an accident.","I used to tremble from nerves so badly that the only way I could hold my head steady was to lower my chin practically to my chest and look up at Bogie. That was the beginning of The Look.","You realize yourself when you start reflecting - because I don't live in the past, although your past is so much a part of what you are - that you can't ignore it. But I don't look at scrapbooks.","When I was a kid, it was Bette Davis. She was my idol. I used to cut school and sit in the back of the theater; of course, I would have snuck in because I couldn't afford a ticket.","I'm not tough, and I never have been. I suppose over the years I've built up kind of a veneer to protect myself because I have functioned on my own for a long, long time, and I have never had a lot of flunkies preceding me to clear the way.","I finally felt that I came into my own when I went on the stage.","Find me a man who's interesting enough to have dinner with and I'll be happy.","Movies are great fun and wonderful when they're good. But you never get to see them till six months after they're finished. So you never get a sense of whether they're really well liked or how good they are. And you don't really know what the finished product is going to be like, because it's a director's medium.","My mother was the greatest example to me of anyone I've ever known. She didn't have an easy life. I adored her. She worked hard all her life, and she was the one who set my values. She was quite an amazing woman, although she wasn't tough at all.","I'm not a sedentary person. I've always been active.","I'm a total Democrat. I'm anti-Republican. And it's only fair that you know it... I'm liberal. The L word!","I remember my oldest son, Steve, saying to me once, 'I don't ever remember seeing you with an apron on.' And I thought, that's right, honey, you did not. That was his concept of what a mother should be.","I've always felt that work - learning from people who know more than I know - is what keeps you going.","Film is not a woman's medium. If you weren't the hottest kid in town, men stayed away from you.","I always wanted to work with Spencer Tracy, which never happened, although I knew him well. And I never worked with Cary Grant.","You are welcoming to everyone when you're a liberal. You do not have a small mind.","I don't have an entourage. In fact, I have no live-in help.","If I could have lived as an actress in any period, it would have been the 1920s - I would have loved to have been part of that speakeasy era.","In Hollywood, an equitable divorce settlement means each party getting fifty percent of publicity.","I don't look in the mirror; don't like what I see; never have. I am not my idea of a beauty. Never was. This is not false modesty. I've just never been enamoured of my face, which of course is magnified umpteen times on screen.","The big rule is that you must never get mixed up with a married man - never even look sideways at another woman's fella. Boy, I really was terrific at obeying that rule, wasn't I?","I wasn't brought up as a society girl to go to balls and be a debutante and marry the social set and money and go to parties. No one in my family lived like that. And I never wanted to live like that. I was brought up to believe in work. I always wanted a career. Always.","I wish Frank Sinatra would just shut up and sing.","It's inappropriate and vulgar and absolutely unacceptable to use your private life to sell anything commercially.","When a woman reaches twenty-six in America, she's on the slide. It's downhill all the way from then on. It doesn't give you a tremendous feeling of confidence and well-being.","I was always a little unsteady in my self-belief. Then there was the Jewish thing. I love being Jewish, I have no problem with it at all. But it did become like a scar, with all these people saying you don't look it.","I called my business manager in California and said, 'Sell all of my stock' - what little of it I had - and it's the only smart financial move I ever made.","The biggest misconception people have about me is that I'm in control of every situation. I'm rarely in control of any situation.","You can't start worrying about what's going to happen. You get spastic enough worrying about what's happening now.","They're guys who want to screw around all the time, which interests me not at all. God knows we've done that, been there, and we don't want to do that any more.","I don't sit around thinking that I'd like to have another husband; only another man would make me think that way.","I figure if I have my health, can pay the rent and I have my friends, I call it 'content.'","A man's illness is his private territory and, no matter how much he loves you and how close you are, you stay an outsider. You are healthy.","Actors today go into TV, which I don't consider has a lot to do with acting.","I would hate now to be married. It does occur to me on occasion that, if I fall and hit my head, there will be no one to make the phone call. But who wants to think about that disaster, I'd prefer not to.","Patience was not my strong point.","Men need to feel important. They feel better when they're with younger girls or unknown girls.","What is the point of working all your life and then stopping?","I never believed marriage was a lasting institution. I thought that to be married for five years was to be married forever.","I love being Jewish; I have no problem with it at all. But it did become like a scar, with all these people saying you don't look it.","There were times, sure, I wanted my career to go better. But once it starts to go downhill, you can never get back, or only to some degree.","When a person who is very ill decides to treat it like a slight virus, you play that game. If you make a big scene, I think it is yourself you are doing it for, not the person who's ill.","Young people, even in Hollywood, ask me, 'Were you really married to Humphrey Bogart?' 'Well, yes, I think I was,' I reply.","It was Howard Hawks who changed my life.","A famous love story is hard to maintain when you both live in the spotlight.","That was my original dream, anyway, to be on stage. I think the stage is an actor's place because actors, it belongs to you.","God - if the press ever quoted anyone correctly, it would be brilliant.","It's just a fact of life that I don't think I've ever been taken particularly seriously in movies by movie makers. I don't know why.","I was this kid, and I was scared to death of all these pros around me... My head would shake, and my hands would shake, and I discovered if I kept my head down and looked up, my head would not shake, so I started to do that when I could, when it was appropriate in a scene.","In actual fact, I've never been one, even from childhood, to kind of analyze myself very much.","All the Warner actors were real actors. They started in theater and led very straightforward lives - you never saw entourages around. The MGM girls were the glamour girls, and they always had the makeup and hair people with them and all that.","I adored 'Breaking The Waves,' so when Lars von Trier wanted me in 'Dogville,' I was beside myself with joy. He works in a way that nobody I've ever worked with works.","My feeling about the movies is that most of them are terrible. If you don't have a decent script and a decent director, forget it.","I'm a big fan of Daniel Day-Lewis. He's a marvelous actor. He stands alone, I think.","I don't consider myself a great actress. I'm just trying to stay alive, actually. I think I'm good, and I've learned a lot, certainly, mostly in the theater. I've been sloughed off movies for years. But what can you do? That's life.","For my peculiar face, I look best when I look as though I'm not wearing make-up.","I used to dream of being other places, other people. It was an escape for me.","Acting is a life of rejection.","You can't acquire a voice. Either you have it, or you don't.","I loved reading Grimm's fairy tales and Hans Christian Andersen, and I loved to dream about other worlds and other lives. Maybe that has something to do with having an incomplete family, being an only child. All I know is I loved to pretend, and all that was in tandem with my wanting to be an actress.","I was never my favourite subject.","I hope I'm thought of as not just a showbiz personality, but as someone who has lived a life and who has hopefully made a contribution to something along the way - someone who is a human being as well as an actress.","My definition of a star is someone who really lasts for a very long time.","I happen to watch public television more than anything else. I'm also a news junkie, so I watch a lot of CNN.","I like to work with really good professional people - anyone with real talent."],"Lauren Beukes":["I've always loved Japanese legend, anime and manga.","Twitter is amazing. I advertised for the position of research assistant on Twitter, and both of my researchers came from there.","Being a journalist, being exposed to the world, to social injustice, to intolerance, growing up here, under apartheid, benefitting from that, has all shaped who I am and what my passions are, and of course that's going to come through in my writing.","I've seen so many screw-ups of representations of South Africa, and it makes me so angry every time.","I did a lot of research on real serial killers, and they're not Hannibal Lecters. They're cruel men who are given the opportunity to do something terrible, and a lot of the time it's about impotence. They feel powerless in the real world.","Fiction is about telling a good story, first and foremost. But of course, everything I'm interested in or angry about leaks into my writing, from art to violence against women.","I moved to New York for love, and it was a disaster, in 2000. And then I had American friends who had lived in South Africa, and they were in Chicago. They said, 'Come and spend some time with us, and we'll help you get over it.'","What I love about collaborating is that you're working with other minds that work differently to yours.","It's hard to get justice in the real world. It's possible in fiction."],"Lauren Bowles":["Real life is crazier than fiction.","I am pretty anal about not crazy Googling myself, and searching. I am sure there are all kinds of horrible things being said that I am not aware of.","Awareness is the key to everything. I think it's important to be aware of how you feel. How do you feel after you exercise? How do you feel after you eat something? I try to be mindful of the food I'm putting in my body, the products I use, and what I put in or on my body.","My husband and I oddly have worked together a couple of times. We did a 'Veronica Mars' episode together. We didn't work together, but we were both in 'Ghost World.' We had a theater company in L.A., for a bunch of years. So, we've worked together a fair amount, and it's always just great fun.","I've basically guest-starred on every show that you can imagine. I am pretty used to being the new kid in school.","When your playing drama, and you're in the moment, and you can nail the emotion that is called for, it just feels like a smooth thing. It's so great. There is nothing like getting a laugh, though.","I don't really ever think in terms of what type of person I'd love to play. I usually just read stuff and can tell. It's always fun to get to do things that stretch you and that you don't get to do a lot, but you never know until you see it.","I'm not completely vegan - my diet's probably about 80 percent plant based, but I do eat some meat. I try to know where everything comes from, though. And all bets are off if my husband and I go to a really great restaurant.","I love to bake! I have a huge sweet tooth, and I love to make things like zucchini muffins, you know, anything decadent like that. And I stand by the claim that chocolate can be good for you! I love having a good piece of dark chocolate, one that's 70 percent or more cacao."],"Lauren Bush":["It's not what my job is about. I'm not out to make a political statement. I want to stand for something, but more by example.","My friends and I are collecting prom dresses to give to girls who can't afford them for their proms.","I think politicians do great things in the world, but I don't think they're the only ones who can. I don't like all the rhetoric and the finger pointing.","I mean, I would never want to do anything to hurt my family, but then again I would never want to do anything to hurt myself. And I think they go hand in hand.","I think most people realize that Barbara and Jenna are college kids, and to make such a big deal out of it is a bit ridiculous. At least now, the press has stopped.","My first big job was an Abercrombie &Fitch campaign. But my mom wouldn't let me skip school for it, so I missed half of the shoot. When we got there, we realized Bruce Weber was the photographer; we knew we had made a mistake!","I was eight when he left office. Like, he had an awesome house, you know, and my cousins and I had awesome trips to Camp David and Washington. It was just all like a good time for me.","Obviously, I've seen what the press has done to my cousins. I would never let that rule my life, but I'm not the kind of person to rebel or do things. I don't know. I don't let the potential for bad press dictate who I am, but I keep that in mind. How can you not?","That was kind of scary. You got the sense as a little kid that you might be at risk now, and then you're like, 'Why are we at risk? It's because my grandfather is in charge of all of this.' You can't really realize the magnitude of a job like that when you are eight.","What interests me is seeing a problem and doing something about it, not all of the stuff around it."],"Lauren Cohan":["I always end up hurting myself doing something mundane. If I have to do some complicated stunt, I'm fine.","When I audition for something, I don't even want to think about who the other actors are in it, who's directing it.","I always think family get-togethers when everybody just sort of crashes out are pretty much the best. If it's more than a few days it gets hard, but for just a few days, it's the most amazing thing ever.","I do actually sing; I love to sing.","For some reason, I bruise like a peach. I don't have enough vitamin C, I think.","I'm a history nerd. Actually acting's the best job for somebody who loves weird, different stuff.","I'd love to do Pat Benatar. Probably either 'Hit Me with Your Best Shot' or 'We Belong'.","One of my really good friends in New York is a musician and looks just like Lindsay Buckingham. We always fancied ourselves the nice Fleetwood Mac."],"Lauren Conrad":["There is never just one thing that leads to success for anyone. I feel it always a combination of passion, dedication, hard work, and being in the right place at the right time.","Some people are willing to betray years of friendship just to get a little bit of the spotlight.","Fitness is a luxury when you are busy!","I always wear bronzer because I love the way my skin looks when it's tan.","It's very hard to lose someone who's the closest person to you in your life.","I'm into mellow dates with really good food.","I'm obsessed with the 1920s, everything from the style to the lifestyle. It was a really cool era.","I love anything really feminine. I love any sort of girly detail - anything with a bow or a heart on it, I'm immediately in love with.","I love going on book tours because it's an opportunity to connect with the people that matter most to my brand.","As a designer, you are flattered to see anyone in one of your designs, whether it's on a red carpet or passing by you in the market. It's this wonderful little high every time.","Blogging is a great way to show your talents and interests to prospective employers, while adding an edge to your resume. If you blog consistently it shows your dedication, passions and creativity - all of which are key attributes employers look for in job candidates.","I think a good friend, to me, is all about trust and loyalty. You don't ever want to second-guess whether you can tell your friend something.","Social media is key to promoting the editorial posts on my website.","I've found when all I'm eating is really fresh, healthy foods, I stop craving pizza and burgers.","Imperfection is relatable.","When you're growing up, you play dress-up - it's a game, it's a pastime. And then as you get older, getting ready and looking nice becomes this constant stress. I want to make it fun again.","I'm not a sexy person. I'm OK with it. I've never been the sexy girl. Whenever I've had a boyfriend, he's always been like, 'Oh, you're cute.'","Everyone has that friend who's every day, like, 'I hate my nose, I hate my nose, I hate my nose.' You either need to come to peace with it and be like, alright, I hate it, but it's part of me - or change it. So I'm not against plastic surgery, I'm against plastic surgery when it doesn't really need to be done.","Being responsible for another human life terrifies me, because I kill plants.","There's not a business or a master plan as far as I'm concerned. I take it week by week, and I don't think you ever expect to be able to do the next thing.","Dating in Los Angeles can be hard, which makes it all the better when you meet a really nice guy.","If you're putting your name on something, it's really important to be a part of it, or else people will just do whatever they want with it. And then it's not really you, and it won't be true.","Dates are always hard. You don't want to be too dressed up or too casual.","In high school I spent most of my time in jeans and T-shirts or Juicy sweats. We're such a laid-back town. I mean, people wore bikinis under their clothes half the time, so you didn't really get dressed up to go to school.","I'd love to design bridal dresses.","Listen to advice from people who have been there and done that. It is so hard to believe that when you are young, but parents, mentors, teachers, they can all be so valuable when it comes to advice.","I think there is a niche for every market.","Any way to make a workout feel like playtime is great.","When you do multiple things you love, it doesn't feel like work.","A lot of my branding has come from stubbornness - I knew what I liked. I knew what I wanted to do.","There's not one person that I say I want to look like.","I love wearing designer pieces with something I found at Target.","I'm my happiest when I'm really busy. I love feeling like I need one more hour of sleep, or when I'm running around frazzled!","One of my biggest goals, especially with writing YA novels, is just to have people enjoy reading.","I don't kiss on the first date. My friends always make fun of me for that! But I will hold hands.","One way to stay grounded in the entertainment industry is to surround yourself with very good people that will constantly remind you how uncool you are.","Five years on TV is a really, really long time.","I almost exclusively wear skinny jeans. I'm terrified of any other cut of denim.","I think any opportunity you have to be green, whether it's in business or in everyday life, you should take it.","I've actually spent a lot of time researching beauty products, how they are produced and how they are sold.","I used to get taxed on my allowance. Yeah, I've been taxed since I was a little kid. And at the end of the year I had to pick a charity to donate my taxes to.","I'm just not a fan of the gym. In fact, I hate it. I understand loving the feeling you get after working out all those endorphins. But going there? It's the worst.","The first series I wrote, 'L.A. Candy,' was always meant to be a three-book series, so when I started out it was all outlined that way and by the time I was done with the third book, I had become so involved and the process and the stories, I was a little bit sad to be done.","I haven't met a woman without insecurities.","During holiday parties I end up recycling a lot of my cocktail dresses and just wearing a layering piece, like a blazer and tights, with it.","I'm not old-fashioned when it comes to dating, but there's something nice about a guy pulling out a girl's chair and opening the door for her, even if it's just in the beginning.","I don't call magazines and let them know about things so they can write stories.","I'm comfortable in front of the camera, but I can't act.","I definitely aspire to be someone like Tyra Banks, who's created an empire for herself.","I read a lot of 'Spark Notes' in high school.","I love Chelsea Handler.","I can sleep anywhere. I'm like an infant.","I don't stage my own publicity.","I mean, it's fun to go out and do stuff in Hollywood, but if it was gone tomorrow, I really wouldn't be disappointed.","I think that like most girls in high school, I just mirrored what was around me.","I've always been a big fan of Phillip Lim. He'll always be a favorite of mine.","I do most of my shopping online. It's just convenient for me.","I go into meetings, and people have this preconceived notion of me that I didn't work hard to get where I am.","You should never need a guy to make you feel complete.","I think it's definitely important to look like yourself on a date. You don't want to look like someone else with too much makeup or too much hair.","The normal 21-year-old doesn't have to worry about their night out being put on TMZ.","I'm a writer slash designer slash TV personality.","I try to never look back at how I dressed in the first few seasons of 'Laguna Beach' because it was pretty bad... head-to-toe bad.","Like most people, I used to wear clothing off the rack. But having them fitted to me makes a really big difference, especially with pieces like a cocktail dress. Little nips and tucks can take 10 pounds off you.","I never wanted to end up in entertainment; that wasn't the goal.","A lot of people in fashion don't want to be linked with anything that has to do with reality TV.","I'm sure a lot of people don't take me seriously.","No one eats pretty.","I try really hard to separate myself from other celebrity brands.","When you are working really hard and you're really focused on your career, a lot of other things suffer.","When you're writing a book, you don't want it to be overly trendy because you want people to enjoy it for years and refer back to it.","I think that makeup can be challenging, especially when you are younger.","I think that it's really nice to learn that makeup is different for every person. Everyone has a different feature on their face that they like to show off.","I think when you're put into a completely different situation and environment, you really see who you are. You're not affected by what's around you. You are who you are.","I like wearing scarves in my hair because they make me look put together without taking a lot of time.","If you're on the cover of any magazine, you certainly get recognized more.","Most of my friends all tend to work in restaurants part time, doing acting classes on the side.","When I work with my art department on putting imagery together for my blog posts I always think, 'Would I pin this?' That really helps.","I really, really want to produce. That's the top of my to-do list.","I like to involve myself in charities that help children and also young women in need.","Whenever someone comes up to me and says, 'I'm having trouble shopping.' I tell them to pull out their 10 favorite, most-worn pieces, then build a wardrobe around them. Those staples are going to be different for everybody.","I've always been open to doing reality again. Just under certain circumstances.","You don't want a slob, but you don't want a guy who is constantly borrowing your tweezers.","I can't even read a script. I've tried and it's painful to watch.","Scripts are corny and predictable. Real life is always better.","None of my friends call me L.C. That was just a high school nickname, and nobody refers to me like that anymore.","I think that I get bored easily with things.","I think clothes hang beautifully on thin women.","I'm meant for California.","People are just obsessed with other people's lives. I don't know whether it's kind of a way to escape their own, or something to follow... I really couldn't tell you.","The only thing that ever really bothers me is that a lot of people think I'm that girl who hates your boyfriend. I'm really not that girl. Some of my friends' boyfriends are my best friends.","I wouldn't include a piece in my collection that I wouldn't wear personally.","I don't have the best dating track record.","Dating is all about the chase. It's fun!","I make fun of guys when I like them. I act like I'm 10 years old. I do it as a test to see if they can laugh at themselves. If they get sensitive, then it's like, 'Um, this isn't going to work.'","The one thing I've learned about friends is that the good ones are rare.","I grew up at the beach and I was always involved in beach clean-ups and caring for my environment.","At the end of the day it's going to hurt your feelings if someone says something mean about you, but I've learned to take a step back and ask myself if it's really going to affect me, if this person who I'm never going to know or meet doesn't like me - and it doesn't.","I think that when you have kids, it's all about them.","Being a good observer is a great tool to have as a writer, just taking the world in.","People label you the way they know you best.","At night I can write for hours.","In Hollywood, you grow up quick.","I get very uncomfortable with people watching me.","I go through phases when I've been filming where I wake up in the middle of the night and I think I'm being filmed.","I like to know exactly what's being put into my food.","I'm not really a big reader.","You have your personal life and you have work life; when it's combined, it's difficult.","My website inspired me to create my book club and provides me with a creative outlet where I can write about things that interest me. It's a platform where I can present ideas or new ventures and get feedback straight from the people who mean the most to me."],"Lauren Daigle":["I consider the homeless just as important as the richest of the rich.","We, as Christians, have a legacy to leave, and it's all about a love of Christ to permeate the music and reach the hearts of all of the people out there, that don't know him and do know him.","My goal is always to just do my best and hope that the people who find my music also find God in the process.","I grew up listening to country music with my dad on the way to school.","There's nothing wrong with wanting to be the best, but when it takes over the joy in the moment, and the joy in the journey, then that's where there's an internal tension. And I have to surrender that.","I have known in my heart since I was a little girl that music was a major part of my life and always would be, but seeing others respond to the words I sing amazes me.","My hope is that people experience the music and, in that, something works in them, that they realise how exceptional they are. Maybe that it inspires them to do something great in their own lives.","You have to know your identity. It's the biggest thing in wanting to pursue creative dreams.","Being from South Louisiana, we're just kind of rootsy.","When I was about 18, I really started diving into Dave Matthews Band and John Mayer Trio and some of those things that have jazz elements but also a pop feel.","When I was a kid, and God was talking to me about music, I was like, 'Okay, I'll sing mainstream music,' because I was afraid to sing Christian music to alienate my friends. Honestly, it was going on 'Idol,' having that kind of exposure, that I realized there's something different about me. I just crave God being a part of every moment.","When I go back to Louisiana, I want to be the same person that my friends remember me as. It's so important to me.","I want God to be speaking louder than the music.","I want to be a good steward and make sure what's in my heart is what God wants, and then once it's done and released, at that point it's up to God and what he does on the back end.","The word 'empower' is something that kept coming up in my heart.","If we show people that fear isn't actually the place that we have to surrender to, fear isn't actually the thing that we have to answer to, but instead, it's going in and loving people.","I definitely don't want to only make music in the Christian genre. I want to expand and kind of dive into whatever else is in store. But that doesn't mean I don't love what I get to do as well.","I definitely don't ever plan on compromising, and if that means I'm rebellious, then so be it. I'm all for it.","I get so full off of stories that people send in of encouragement.","When I was little, I would sing all around the house.","I loved Celine Dion. I loved Whitney Houston and these big powerhouse vocals.","I love co-writing. That whole process is a challenge in that good writers are pushing you.","Seriously, my heart is to just go forward as far as I can, making music that I love and seeing where the journey takes me.","Someday, I hope to do a jazz club tour.","When I was younger, I would set up Grammy parties at my house where I would invite all of my friends over, and my whole family would sit in the living room glued to the TV. But I would just dream of someday going there, and I would watch the red carpet interviews over and over and study what was happening.","The most incredible part of seeing people embrace and recognize my music is experiencing the lives of people when they are powerfully affected, encouraged, and personally impacted.","I'm so grateful that God has allowed His heart for people to translate through music, to impact the lives of so many, just like a loving Father would.","In South Louisiana, every single thing we do is jazz or zydeco.","As I've gotten older, my love for jazz has increased.","When I was 15, I had this illness and was basically housebound for two years.","I love to sing all kinds of music, but I know that my heart is for people to know God, and I want them to experience his love.","I have this call in my heart to reach all people.","It doesn't matter if they're in this block or that block: my heart is for all people to know and encounter the love of God.","When it comes to awards and things like that - I don't know why - I just always sit in amazement and never really expect it."],"Lauren DeStefano":["'Dystopian,' by definition, promises a darker story.","Every generation has a macabre notion that wars, government prohibition, natural disasters or mankind itself could be the downfall of society and the world as a whole.","Most dystopian, classic and contemporary, paints a future world that puts a twist on present society - a future world that could plausibly happen.","I realized how wonderful YA is and how I really wanted to write something that created that level of intrigue.","It was my fifth grade teacher who introduced the idea that writing could be more than a hobby for me.","When I am writing anything in general, I just want to tell the story that exists in my head; I don't try to write a parable or make a point.","When I was growing up, there actually wasn't a lot of YA literature as it exists today. Most of the YA that I read was from the '60s and '70s, older than me.","When I was 11 or 12, I was really bored with everything on my summer reading list. It was all happy, middle-grade kinds of books. I was getting frustrated, because I liked to read. My mother went to the library and got me a copy of 'The Other Side of Midnight' by Sidney Sheldon. It was my first adult book."],"Lauren German":["I'm very klutzy. I've fallen off horses, I've tripped with my high-heeled boots over a stunt guy.","I always get cast as the girl who's dying or the girl who's killing or the girl who's suicidal - all these heavy roles. But I like playing them.","I'd love to do comedy."],"Lauren Gibbs":["More and more, I am realizing that life is too short to do crap that doesn't make you happy, and we only get one shot at it all.","One of the most common misconceptions about Olympic sports is that they only happen at the Olympics.","You have to find what you're really passionate about, throw yourself into it, and focus on those small wins.","I played volleyball for Brown University and loved playing there. I played all four years and was captain my senior year. Second team all-Ivy, academic all-Ivy. I really loved it. When I was graduated, I figured that was it.","I never get sick - not a cold, not a cough or sore throat. Everyone around me can be hacking up a lung, and I'm fine.","I travel quite a bit for both bobsled and leisure.","I am used to being places where I don't speak the language. What I am not used to is being in a part of a country where few people speak my language. Call it ignorance, arrogance, or what have you, but most places I have visited, I was lucky enough to be able to get by with English.","A combine is a series of athletic tasks that help a coaching staff measure an athlete's ability to be competitive in a sport. A bobsled combine requires a sprint, broad jump, two-handed shot toss, and a back squat and power clean.","When you start your bobsled career at 30, a time when most are settling down into their 'real careers' and many are getting married, you can imagine the barrage of questions and the look of, 'You're doing what?' that you receive.","If your dream sounds like a real stretch and everyone around you is looking at you like you have completely lost it, it might just be exactly what you need.","I'd always loved sports, and the Olympics were something I thought about often as a kid, but those dreams felt like a lifetime ago.","I love when things don't go to plan.","It is amazing how many thoughts can race through your head in a minute.","It is funny, the things you miss about a more conventional lifestyle. I miss seemingly mundane tasks, like cleaning the kitchen, moving my furniture around to achieve just the right look, and checking the mailbox. I miss making my bed in the morning before work.","I grew up thinking that corporate America was my destination. Then I got there, and I was making the money I wanted to make, but I just wasn't happy.","Every day, I put on a suit, and I felt like I was playing dress-up in my mum's closet. It just wasn't right.","I've always been a risk taker. When I told my mum I was quitting my job to be a bobsledder, she wasn't surprised.","I'm a volleyball player, so I like Lycra and Spandex.","Sometimes I can't sleep at night because I'm so excited to work on sprinting the next day, because I'm such a bad sprinter.","When I graduated from college, I was told I could do great things and be great, but I didn't know what that meant and what it would feel like and the work that it would take.","I went to a good school, played sports; things came relatively easy for me. Whenever I would get faced with adversity, I would always go do something else.","Bobsled is the first time I decided, win, lose, or draw, I was all-in for all four years. I figured if I was going to step away from a very lucrative career, I owed it to myself and my family to see this through to the very end.","I actually found CrossFit on a run from my house in Orange County. I moved around with it for a while, which is the best part about it. I love it, but it was something I did because I enjoyed the camaraderie aspect of it, not so much the competing side of it.","CrossFit really helped me with mental toughness, which I really appreciate. It also gave me this network of people cheering me on, which is incredible.","I love all food. All of it. I wish I could be a professional eater.","I think the biggest thing to being an elite-level bobsledder is grit. You have to really want it. It's a very blue-collar sport. We do a lot of the work ourselves; we sand the runners, we wash the sled, we help maintain the sled. Obviously, we have a sled mechanic that travels with us, but a lot of the work we do ourselves.","I had a corporate job and wore a suit to work every day, and I just kind of felt like I wasn't living my authentic self or doing what I was passionate about.","I think that was the scariest part about bobsled, is when you just don't know what's happening, you don't know where you are on the track, you don't know when it's going to be over, and you don't know what it's supposed to feel like.","I can't believe where life has taken me.","I've always loved public speaking, and that's something I definitely will pursue after the Olympics.","Once my pilot and I push and jump into the sled, I hold on for dear life in the back while she skillfully and hopefully quickly navigates the two of us down a mile of icy, often bumpy, sharp right and left turns. I then pull the brakes at the end.","For the first time in long time, I can say I love what I do. I can't say that every day is easy or fun, but there are few greater thrills in life than hurling yourself down an iced-over water slide in a carbon fiber bathtub.","If I look in the mirror, my body is absolutely perfect. I think not enough women feel that way.","Unfortunately, our sport has a weight limit, so every season, I have to lose weight. You just get tired of not eating the way you want to eat, so in the off-season, I'll binge and gain a few pounds and then have to lose them back."],"Lauren Graham":["The thing about good writing is it has a music to it.","I didn't grow up identifying with beauty. I grew up thinking I could be smart and funny - those are the things I got feedback on.","I always saw myself as a comedic actor and wacky best friend.","Perspective is the most important thing to have in life.","Growing up an only child with a single parent is probably why I'm an actor.","Texting is not flirting, if you don't care about me enough to say the words than that's not love, I don't like it!","Nobody ever seems to want my advice about serious stuff. People will be like: 'Who made that sweater?' Or 'How did you get your hair so straight?' They don't to come to me for the relationship advice or deep stuff. In fact, my little sister actually hides from me.","I've always really liked being active. I do Spinning classes, I run, I have a trainer, I do Pilates with my sister Shade.","If I had a normal job and had been moving up, I'd be management level now.","What I remember about coming to L.A. is that suddenly work was as big a presence in my life as my life itself.","We moved in 8th grade, so 7th grade I was doing okay, and then 8th grade, everything fell apart. I had no fashion sense to speak of. We only had a couple of hair care products back then. We didn't have all these things to tame your hair. I had glasses; I had braces. I had it all.","All my references are 50 years old-when somebody shot J.R., you know? Oh my god, I'm 100!","It's great to have an acting job in the age of Reality TV.","As I've gotten older, I've gotten more liberal, and my father is increasingly conservative. It's so shocking to me because I always thought we had the same politics. The day I realized we voted for different presidents, I practically fell out of my chair.","The thing you must really do in television is bring yourself to everything you do - you can't try to be anybody else.","I've always thought my strengths were I'm smart, and I have a good sense of humor. I definitely struggle with feeling confident.","I love doing the 'New York Times' crossword puzzle, even on the days I can't finish it.","I've made out more this season on a family-friendly show than ever in my actual life.","Some people think my father was a spy, because of working for that government agency in Vietnam, but he can't find his car keys, much less keep a national secret.","The parts for women, you're either like the quietly suffering wife or the wild girl.","You want the story to end when it's supposed to and not be squeezed for somebody's financial gain.","The thing I don't like on television is when somebody does something that makes absolutely no sense just for the shock of it.","Belly buttons are cool!","I'm nice, and I show up on time.","One of the things I like about the show is it redefines the idea of what it is to be a mother, which at its most basic level is to take care of a child. It doesn't mean you have to look like the ladies in the Lysol commercials.","These days I have to be extra nice in stores. It never fails that whenever I look as bad as I can possibly look or I am sort of cranky because the store is out of something, that is precisely the time when someone one will recognize me and say: 'I really like your show.'","Personally, all I ever want to be wearing are jeans.","I've dated people who I thought were going to be a big deal in my life, and I've also spent long periods by myself.","While I very much wanted to be in a relationship, I didn't want to be in the wrong one.","My mother had lived in London since I was little, so she never got to see my school plays and stuff.","I would like to be part of a family, however that looks. Family is really important to me.","When the creator of the show is gone, the actors end up being the people who have been there the longest.","I love TV. I think I'd do a half-hour single-camera comedy.","None of my characters have really had jobs.","All TV shows are basically part of the same storyline.","I just don't know that a TV show demands a movie ending.","Well, it's more of a sane life to be part of an ensemble! I find that the work can be more specific too and I have to really make sure I know where I am in the story because I'm not in every scene.","I think what my hope is is that the only downside of having a steady job on television is, I think for all actors, there's a piece, there's some adrenaline, and part of the love of the job is not knowing what's coming next, and the variety.","I take the no-doughnut pledge, and then I break it.","Like my dad, I have a Christmas party most years. I like to celebrate and see as many people as possible.","As actors we always say that once the person in a scene gets what they want, the scene is over. It's resolved. But life is never resolved - you're always in the process.","Honestly, 'Parenthood' was not what I planned. I didn't plan to do another drama. I didn't plan to play a single mom. I didn't plan, even, to do an ensemble show. But I hadn't found anything I liked as much. I just connected to the show.","Strangers were worried about me; that's how long I was single!","If you're meeting someone for the first time after three hours of hair, makeup, and styling, you've already set the bar too high.","I get concerned when I see kids on their phones. They don't read enough anymore, anything longer than a tweet.","My time at Barnard was fun but stressful. I transferred there from the acting conservatory at NYU, and my Rolling Around On the Floor Pretending to Be a Lion classes didn't translate into many academic credits.","Because I have no consistent schedule as an actor, it was difficult to develop one as a writer. Ideally, I'd like to write first thing in the morning, every day. But sometimes I'm called to set before the sun comes up, or I've worked late the night before, or I'm on a plane.","I'm baffled when young actors aren't familiar with current film, television and theater, or aren't interested in older films or plays and the history of the craft in general. If you don't know what's out there, and what came before, then how can you picture yourself working, and how can anyone else?","Having trees and a track to run on have become more important to me than living near cool restaurants.","I've pretty much always been on a diet since I was born. And the women in my family struggle, so I find the less I think about food, in a way, the happier I am. In general, I think I eat less the less I think about it.","Sometimes I'll think, 'That was a really nice day. I ate well, I exercised, I called some friends, wasn't working too hard,' but I rarely have one of those.","Honestly, I was such a tomboy as a kid. People were taking from their mothers' closets - I was taking from my dad's closet. It was the '80s, so it wasn't terrible, but I was wearing my dad's dress shirts over jeans from the Gap.","I have way too many jeans. But I never seem to have a top to wear.","I really think if you're trying to look good, do something athletic. I have a little mini tramp, and sometimes I'll just try to jump for 20 minutes. It gets your blood circulating, and that always looks really pretty.","Just for daily wear, I love discovering new jeans companies.","I get a delivery of a diet food during the week, which doesn't mean that I don't eat the occasional Krispy Kreme doughnut.","I've learned a lot from trainers over the years, but mainly that you need discipline to stay in the gym and out of the many fine cupcake emporiums on every corner.","Acting is the most bizarre profession. You can stay in it for years and not really be in it and be waiting for someone to give you an opportunity. It's like when I watch 'American Idol' and see people who have been told to believe in themselves at all costs: It's not always a good idea.","For a time in high school, I had glasses, braces, and a cast. I like to call this look 'no date for homecoming.'","I've seen 'The Godfather Part II,' 'Broadcast News,' and 'Annie Hall' more than 20 times each.","I dream of playing Lady Cora's sister on 'Downton Abbey.'","One thing I've learned is I actually don't like variety very much. I like having the same thing over and over: assorted lean proteins, arugula salad, quinoa or brown rice with soy sauce, olive oil, lemon, and salt. Those ingredients can pretty much get me through the week.","'Mom' isn't an adjective or a personality; they're not all the same.","As an actor, you have to maximize your time, because you don't know what's going to happen in your 50s and 60s and 70s. It's like the career of an athlete: For many people, it ends at a certain point."],"Lauren Greenfield":["I've often used the extremes in my work to comment on the mainstream. I think that sometimes a subject that I'm working on, like popular culture, is so present all around us that they're hard to see. It's like: How do you see the air you breathe? How do you see how it affects you?","My first book, 'Fast Forward', was about growing up in the shadow of Hollywood and how kids are affected by the culture of materialism and the cult of celebrity, and I've often felt the reason my work has an audience in the U.K. is because it's everything the British love to hate about the Americans.","You have these relationships with people that you care about, but I also try to stick to my job as filmmaker and be fair and truthful about what I saw and my experience of the people, hopefully informed by a deep understanding of them.","All my film ideas and subjects have come from photography.","I am very lucky that my first film was fully commissioned by HBO.","I focus on a lot of women's issues.","I've been a documentary photographer for much longer than I have been a filmmaker.","I've long been interested in looking at the culture of consumerism and also was interested in this connection between the American dream and the house, and the house being kind of the ultimate expression of self and success.","When I first moved from photography to filmmaking, I was worried about how big I had to become. I was one person, or maybe me and an assistant, and I had these small cameras, and maybe a flash.","My photography is often a sociological look at American culture, and it's been very well published in the U.K."],"Lauren Groff":["If there's a black cat that crosses the street in my path, I will turn around and walk 20 minutes out of my way to not cross it.","A lot of books about marriage are about marriages falling apart.","At least in my case, a very simple, regular, happy life makes for better writing.","Sometimes I read a biography of some tempestuous artist and find myself longing for fireworks! booze! bloody fights!; I do think that life must be so much more thrilling when you're actively miserable.","As a person, I do ascribe to a lot of magical thinking myself.","I see history as really cyclical in terms of the intense idealism, and the desire to create a better life outside of societal norms.","We think of stories a lot of the time as being horizontal texts, beginning to end. But I love the idea of having little vertical spikes in the story, too.","I see history as really cyclical in terms of the intense idealism and the desire to create a better life outside of societal norms. In America, possibly because of whatever the American dream is, this happens over and over again. These eras repeat.","There aren't very many good models of feminine rage - and the ones that we remember are ones where women take that anger internally and implode themselves in a real way, like Anna Karenina or Emma Bovary.","At some point, I picked up an old library copy of 'To The Lighthouse' someone had bought for 25 cents. I began to read and didn't stop until the sun had blistered my back. A mysterious rightness, a beautiful submerged truth had invaded me, one that has ever since seemed slightly beyond my grasp.","My childhood was as conventional as you could get.","But I've married a deeply sensible person who is extremely good at talking me down from my various ledges, and who takes care of me in a billion ways.","Time is the currency - the highest valued currency we have now. And people giving you their time is so incredible. They don't have to like your book, either. That's a totally separate gift.","I write everything out in longhand in one fast go. And then I throw out the first few and start over again. By the end of the first draft, the whole thing's messy and disgusting and horrible, but you really understand the foundational stuff.","Sometimes immense things, like war and death and aging, are best seen from the corner of the eye and written of only obliquely, with tremendous lightness.","I feel as if I've been so inured to failure, because I fail more than I succeed. As with any kind of fiction, I throw out so many pages; I get rejected so many times.","I love that he's both comic and tragic, and highly poetic but also just dirty at times. ... I love that within the world of Shakespeare's plays, the whole world is sort of encompassed in a certain way.","Bigger stories are made out of longer acquaintance with fact and character, but I also love the tiny stories in which almost everything has to be inferred and imagined.","Total intimacy is a myth; that said, a particular kind of loneliness can be both beautiful and fruitful.","My childhood was as conventional as you could get. I think I probably created 'Arcadia' with a certain amount of wishful thinking. I would have loved to have more looseness and freedom and community.","If there's a black cat that crosses the street in my path, I will turn around and walk 20 minutes out of my way to not cross it. You know how in New York there's a lot of scaffolding? I won't walk under scaffolding or under ladders. I wear things like a baseball player wears things that are supposed to have luck.","I have a feeling that books are a lot like people - they change as you age, so that some books that you hated in high school will strike you with the force of a revelation when you're older.","I am a person beset with fears, and one of my fears is that this thing that I will be writing for five years won't work. And the likelihood, of course, is that it won't - and that's fine.","We're all functions of our societies, right? And we all become who we are because of the invisible forces that mold us.","The darkest period of my life, so far, arrived the summer I was pregnant with my eldest son. The future was growing in me with all of its terrifying unpredictability, and I found myself anxious, unable to work and woefully at sea.","I once spent an entire night in a hotel in New York looking across the way into someone's apartment where nothing was happening but daily life, a phone call, television watching, staring into the fridge. Seeing how those strangers lived over that small distance and in absolute silence moved me deeply.","Marriage seems to be predicated on protecting a very deep and intimate form of mystery.","While I know some women who are stunningly sanguine when they're pregnant, I dissolve into a total mess. What normally appears sturdy turns fragile: the economy, the climate, humanity's baseline social contract.","I seem to long for community and mistrust it in equal measure, and so I spend most of my days carefully constructing various communities in stories and seeing if they fly.","The greatest texts, I think, first dazzle, then with careful rereading, they instruct. I have learned from Virginia Woolf more than I even know how to articulate.","Among so many things, 'Time Passes' has shown me subversive ways of portraying time, of looking away from the human to the far more terrifying, far more immense texture of time beneath the minute span of a human life."],"Lauren Holly":["It was at the beginning of all this tabloid frenzy. Our garbage was being gone through, and we were involved in all these chases getting home, and people camping out on our property to get pictures.","I never had that reputation of being not accessible.","You'll be a good parent when you're ready to no longer be selfish. Until I was about 35, it was all about me. I look back and I'm astonished at how I lived my life - it was totally self-involved.","It always made me sad that there were kids who didn't have homes.","Thank God I didn't have my children until I was a little bit older.","I like trying to get pregnant, I'm not so sure about childbirth.","I started in this business on soap operas.","I never had that star aura.","I just thought that I had had my fill for a while and wanted to have a family. My husband was moving to Chicago for his job. And so I went along. And it was a great thing that I did."],"Lauren Holmes":["I got into writing in college... well, in elementary school. But in college, I started writing seriously and had a professor who read my writing and gave me permission to pursue that as a real effort and time-consuming effort.","I did work at Planned Parenthood between college and grad school. For me, anywhere that I worked or anywhere that I've come to know intimately is a great place to set a story because it's a place where you know all the details already, and you don't have to make them up; you can just borrow them.","I think the quickest way to get me to do something is really, 'You can't do that.' And I'm like, 'OK, I will make that happen.'"],"Lauren Hutton":["We have to be able to grow up. Our wrinkles are our medals of the passage of life. They are what we have been through and who we want to be.","Lord knows, I never want to waste any more of my time in mirrors.","A lot of modeling is how much crap you can take.","I look at my first appointment book from 1965 and I get dizzy. I was constantly in a phone booth calling photographers.","That's the mistake women make - you shouldn't see your makeup. We don't want to look like we've made an effort.","I discovered myself!","I was making $50 a week as a house model at Christian Dior for nine months before I learned that photographic models made $50 an hour!","Eileen Ford wanted me to fix my nose and my teeth. I said, Sure, great, but I really had no intention to.","I had always broken the rules.","Whatever tension is on set can end up on your face.","No one's raising children any more. To love a child, you've got to work for it. You have to change its diapers and feed it at night!","We need a new religion.","I'm not part of the cultural elite. I'm a down-home girl. Always have been, always will be.","I had 30-something years' experience in modeling, which is rare.","The last thing we need is yet another makeup company. Even I have a nervous breakdown when I go through the department store makeup floor.","I'd like to be the first model who becomes a woman.","There are plenty of beautiful girls who don't photograph well.","Avedon wouldn't let me put wax between my teeth like I usually did.","In 1974, the modeling world changed. Jerry Ford and my lawyer negotiated the deal for the first exclusive contract in modeling history.","I became a specialist at comedic one-liners.","I don't spend much money on clothes; I never did.","When I went back to modeling, nobody knew how to deal with a 46-year-old model!"],"Lauren Jauregui":["You can't use the fact that I'm bisexual against me if that's something I'm proud of.","It's good to be an anarchist and just love yourself.","This country was built and continues to survive off the backs of immigrants and refugees.","Having those positive friends around can really make a difference in how you view yourself. It's helped me realize that there's no such thing as having a perfect body, and just because I'm not shaped the same way as another girl is, it doesn't mean I'm not pretty. It just means that no two girls are alike.","I'm everywhere; I'm just a soul that's floating around here on earth.","Read your contracts. Up and down, left and right.","For me, honesty is a huge thing, and loyalty, when it comes to relationships.","It's hard to accept yourself when you live in a world where nobody is like you, or you feel like nobody is like you because there's no representation.","Don't lose your love for yourself and how much you've grown and how far you've come.","You need to accept yourself for who you are and surround yourself with a good group of girl friends that'll lift you up instead of put you down.","We have an energy about us that's so unique and so intense, and it's because of how much power we have in us as individuals, being confident, harnessing that power, and wanting to share that with other women.","A lot of people talk, but they don't say anything. And people listen, and they don't absorb anything of substance.","It's truly disheartening to me to see so many beautiful women who have no idea what their potential is.","I think pop culture has always influenced society.","I'm proud of myself, and I'm going to continue to grow.","I am a bisexual Cuban-American woman, and I am so proud of it.","Honestly, like, I fall in love with souls, and I don't really even see anything but that, to be honest.","We are screaming battle cries against those whose political and personal agendas threaten our lives and sanity.","I rekindled a friendship I hadn't had in a long time, and I was reminded of all the parts of me that had left. I was like, 'Wow, I love to paint and to write and to be outside.'","We like that when girls look at us, they don't see perfect little blond-haired, blue-eyed Barbie dolls.","My theory is the spectrum: there's a spectrum of sexuality.","What I would tell everyone is don't lose your sense of individuality.","When I was in fifth grade, I got bullied really nastily about my appearance.","We've digressed from the true meaning of life. We have replaced the Creator with money and claim Him in the name of war. We have dishonored our children.","I am proud to be part of a community that only projects love and education and the support of one another.","When we auditioned for 'The X Factor,' we were five individuals going into the show. That obviously means we are five solo artists in our beings, so we have our own creative ideas, of what sounds the best music-wise, because we are all artists.","I feel like our fans identify with us because they're like, 'I'm her,' or 'I don't look like any of them, but I'm different like them.'","We had so many of our fans tell us how worthless they felt before they found out about us and watched our interviews and listened to our music.","I'm either dressing like a rocker chick, or I'm looking like I just stepped out of ancient Greece! It all depends on my mood. I love bohemian vibes, too.","I feel like art has been at the center of change since the beginning of time.","When you really break it down to the way the world works, we're all little humans floating on a gas ball in the middle of space. That's the reality of our situation. And we've created these concepts and constructs that move us away from that.","For me as an artist, pop culture has so much power and influences society on a regular basis - I see it in the kids; I see it in everyone that I encounter. Everyone is influenced by pop culture whether we want to be or not.","I would say that regardless of how the brand has been created, we are four hard-working women who have succeeded in making our dream to become artists a more possible reality through this.","For me, coming into my own and being comfortable with myself really changed me as a person and made me more confident and vibrant.","As an artist, I don't care about where we are in the charts and all that. The important thing to me is to connect with a creative project.","Even the fact that I labelled myself makes me mad sometimes, because dude, I'm just a free spirit.","I'm marching for women; I'm marching for the LGBT community. I'm marching for immigrants. I happen to fall into all three categories, so I'm marching for myself at the end of the day and for my family and my friends. And for whoever else deserves it.","We want to just make music that impacts people - we don't really care about the rest.","Two powerful women making art together is always really cool.","We know how hard we've worked, we know how our choreography makes us feel empowered. We have our voices, which are incredible and kind of surpass anything else.","A bunch of my fans have come up to me and said, 'Because of you, and because you came out, I have finally begun to accept myself.' That is infinitely incredible for me. I didn't expect to get to the point where I would own up to it within myself.","I do feel like the blogs that I follow share an aesthetic and draw a lot from '90s influences.","I like to dress in edgy black leather and denim, but I like a wide range of things.","We all allow each other to explore our individual things that make us happy, and so we're just being supportive of each other and making sure we focus on Fifth Harmony, and what's important to the group is important to all five of us.","I just don't feel limited by genre.","Every time somebody asks me, 'Oh, when you mix your own music, what are you going to make?' And I don't know.","I really, genuinely don't look at my schedule too often, because when I do, I get a little overwhelmed by how much is going on.","I think that until we're 21, human beings don't get to know themselves very much.","I gave my life to this without knowing what I was doing. I was very little when I started in 5H: I was 16.","Doing something that is your passion, in my case related to music and art, being a performer playing shows around the world, that is a dream come true.","If you connect with an artist because of what they make as a body of work, you feel like they're your friend. You feel like you're on the journey of connection with them because they see the world the same way you do. That's so powerful, and if you use that, you can genuinely change minds.","Amandla Stenberg is so powerful in her energy and what she speaks about and what she projects. I think it's incredible.","I am proud to be the granddaughter and daughter of immigrants who were brave enough to leave their homes and come to a whole new world with a different language and culture and immerse themselves fearlessly to start a better life for themselves and their families.","I am proud to be a woman.","I was raised to feel that I can do anything, and I will always believe that.","I feel like people make such a big deal out of sexuality. It's so weird to me, because at the end of the day, it's just about soul connection. It's just about who you connect with.","Some of our songs are empowering, but I feel like more so than our music, it's who we are. We're four women who are completely different ethnicities, completely different body types, completely different walks of life and opinions.","I feel like, especially being around other girls, it's really easy to start picking yourself apart and being like, 'Wow, she looks better than me.'","My grandparents and my mom came from Cuba back in the '60s because they were fleeing from communism and Castro. I wouldn't be here otherwise.","I've always been passionate about human rights in general. I think anyone who knows me can attest to that.","I went to a high school that taught me to be more worldly. The whole curriculum was very globally based. We learned a lot about other cultures and reflected on them.","I've always had this sense of justice - I get that from my mom, for sure. When you see stuff that's wrong, it's just wrong, man. You gotta point that out.","I have a lot of people in my life who support me.","I love every time that I get to be on a stage with Halsey. She's so incredible.","I'm so proud of my girl Kehlani. She and SZA are killing it.","I want to give the girls who admire us everything I can. I don't want to just fill them with selfies and crap. That's not what I'm about. I'm about, 'Be aware of the world and that you're not the only one in it.'","I wasn't born into a family that told me that I wasn't capable of what my brother was capable of. I can do anything.","Growing up in Miami, being Cuban is integrated into our culture. When we greet anyone, we give them a kiss on the cheek.","I needed our fans to know they're loved and accepted, and fear isn't the way to go.","We should care about each other.","We definitely work hard, and we want to keep our fans engaged... we want to give them new music.","That messed me up, growing up in the public eye when I was a teenager. That's when everyone is trying to find themselves.","There's this notion that artists are supposed to be dumb and frivolous. I completely disagree with that.","If I could tell every Trump supporter two things, it would be to travel and read a history book. Look beyond yourselves; look at how petty the morals you uphold seem when you realize we are not the only ones.","They sell you this present of rainbows and butterflies, and as a 16-year-old, that's what I bought. It's why I did 'X Factor' and why I ended up in a group. But then you're working so hard, so young.","We're learning the business, meeting people we need to know, getting knowledgeable about our craft.","When we all start to wake up and realize that our comforts are fleeting, and more money is never going to save this world, maybe, just maybe, will we be able to return back to the grace of America's principal values.","I feel like all four of us are really powerful in our messages, what we speak about, and what we are about.","We're all really passionate, and we voice it in our own way, and we all come from a loving place and see from the same perspective, which is why I feel so blessed to be part of this group.","There's straight people, and there's super gay people, and then there's everybody in between, and everybody is a little bit of something because sexuality is fluid.","I like the ability to engage intellectually with someone. I get so bored so quickly, so if you can't keep me interested, then I'm out.","For me, I love Marc Anthony a lot. He's one of my dad's favorite artists, and I listened to him a lot growing up.","I love Celia Cruz - she was also a huge part of my childhood. She's an iconic woman.","I think Ed Sheeran would be a great collaboration.","It's amazing the support we've been able to get from Latinos and just in general from everyone.","We're not all thin model types, and we're not all perfectly colored. It mind-boggles me that somebody would take time out of their life to make someone feel inferior because of something like that. That, to me, is insane.","I feel like a lot of people disregard the scrutiny that people like us are under.","You can't help it as a human being when you're put under so much scrutiny by multiple people, not even just one person in real life, telling you something. It harms you.","I've been outspoken forever about everything.","I think that people have a very strict perception of what a pop artist is.","Women are super-dynamic. I can be whatever I want to be. I can have interests in so many different kinds of things.","I love music; I love performance. I love everything revolving around art. But I also am really passionate about politics and human rights and science and the environment. Those are things that fascinate me.","When someone like me, who is in the entertainment industry, which is a huge falsity of its own, tries to talk outwardly about politics, especially as a woman, I receive a lot of 'Shut up - just sing and dance for us, you idiot.'","I'm actually a huge fan of changing every single 'anti-Trump' sentiment to 'pro-human rights' because they are synonymous.","Societies have been conditioned to believe that entertainers are just that, but I refuse to be put into the box of a puppet.","It's cool to be able to give each other that space to really explore ourselves individually and grow.","Kids would tell me I was fat and say other mean things about my body.","I don't know if anyone should do anything that's not authentic to them.","If you love women, and you want to sing about love, don't feel the need to say 'he.' Don't feel the need to adapt to the society or the culture."],"Lauren Kate":["Be fearless. Be glib. Be enigmatic. Read. Never give up.","Cooking is the best way to unwind at the end of a long writing day. There's something mindless and hands-on about cooking, which makes it feel like the very opposite of writing, which is heady but inactive.","Alicia Silverstone from 'Clueless' plays the role of the quintessential buttoned-up beauty who still knows how to throw down. She's intimidating from a distance but happy to befriend the new girl and show her the lay of the land.","Fallen angels could not enter sanctuaries of God. The moment they crossed the threshold, the house of worship would go up in flames, incinerating every mortal inside.","I believe love's grip transcends gender. It transcends everything short of a very few primal needs like hunger, thirst, a need for oxygen.","At some point, I fell in love. Shortly thereafter, I got my heart broken. Sniff, sniff. And I realized at a young age - no matter what any adult literary critic would have us believe about female strength and autonomy - there is no test to strength of character like love.","Before 'Fallen,' I'd written love stories and more love stories. I'd fallen in love with love stories - but they were also beginning to feel just a little bit too insular, too small.","Every weekday morning, I picture my first paragraph while I hike with my dog Milo near Mulholland Drive, looking out over the San Fernando Valley. I edit the paragraph, then memorize it, so that when I get back home and sit down at my computer, the blank screen's tyranny lasts only a second or two. A brief reign!","It's worth pointing out that no one faults a male protagonist for falling in love. What is it about a boy needing a girl that seems to round out his character, while a girl needing a boy can be dismissed as pathetic?","People ask me, 'Why angels? Why paranormal? Why teens?' In the beginning, I'm not sure I knew I was starting down any of those twisted paths - paths that now seem so familiar to me that they are downright comforting. In the beginning, I was just writing about love.","When I sit down to write a scene, I have a plan in mind, and I'm thrilled when a character disregards my goals and takes the story to a place I hadn't imagined.","I buy way too many cookbooks and read food blogs at night when I can't sleep.","Occasionally I volunteer in the kitchen of a pop-up supper club in L.A., which I really love. It's like being a line cook in a great restaurant for one night at a time.","I don't write about love because it makes for easy, passive heroes. I write about how love makes my characters more autonomous, more self-possessed, more opinionated and powerful. I write about characters who pursue relationships that make them the people they want to become. I write about love as a superpower.","Olivia Hussey from Zefferelli's 'Romeo and Juliet' makes the intense vulnerability of true love look magnificent.","Steve McQueen from 'The Getaway' is tough and independent. He can be diffident but is unabashed when it comes to love. And he's undeniably sexy.","Cam disappears at the end of 'Rapture.' It was the only way for me to say good-bye to him at the time, and it's the way he prefers to split, anyway. I always knew I would return to him. He's been my favorite from the start. Readers have long asked what happened to him, but I had to wait for his story to come to me on its own.","My process has changed in recent years because I now have two young kids. I have to be more regimented. The days are very short.","I tend to write some, then outline some, then delete some, then go back and rewrite some. I love revising and hate first drafts. I have to wear bedroom slippers. My current favorites come from the Zetter Hotel in London. They have little tobacco pipes on the toes."],"Lauren Lapkus":["I definitely get inspired by people who are disgusting on some level.","I'm a huge 'Bachelor' fan!","Improv changed my life in the best way. I gained so much confidence and really learned how to use my sense of humor to do something other than make sarcastic comments to the TV, though that remains one of my best skills. I stayed in Chicago for college mainly to continue doing improv, which was an awesome decision for me.","You have to go as hard as you possibly can, or it's going to be weak. Whenever I find myself not committing fully to a character, it's not as funny. It doesn't have that clear point of view, and you find yourself wandering all over the place, whereas committed characters make strong choices that are clear to the audience.","I love improvising on the spot. I like that pressure.","I did a number of local children's theater plays growing up, but in 5th grade, I had some good times on stage making people laugh as a troll in 'The Hobbit.' That solidified my dream to be on 'Saturday Night Live,' which was hugely influential for me growing up.","Every so often, you have to do a show that makes you walk to your car with your head down, wondering what you're doing with your life. It's good for you, as long as you're not feeling that way every night.","I love creating characters that are ridiculous and flawed. To me, the most important thing about comedy is the joy it can bring to the performers and the audience alike. I love making people laugh and not over-thinking things. Some of my favorite moments are when I am doing an improv scene with friends, and I can't stop laughing during it.","Most people have kind of done something that could put them in jail at least for one night.","Comedy is my first love; that's my main goal in life - to keep doing comedy.","I often play characters on TV shows that are more sweet and naive and just kind of puppy-dog eyes, and I don't think I am like that as a person.","My improv definitely shows a different side of myself, which is more true to what my real humor is and what my real personality is, and I think - I guess 'wild' is a good word for it. I'm still sweet! But I won't let anyone walk all over me.","I had a teacher who recommended I take improv classes in Chicago - I'm from Evanston, Illinois - so I did improv classes at Improv Olympic, and that kind of opened me up.","Doing improv really got me started in my whole career.","I believe that each person can make a difference, but it's so slight that there's basically no point.","I love L.A. and feel attached to this city, but I don't identify myself as being a part of it.","I'm more of a tomboy - I fall into the jeans-and-a-T-shirt style, for sure - but I have a girlie side to me.","I love watching 'The Real Housewives of New York.' That's my guilty pleasure. But I don't even feel guilty. I can just watch it, zone out, and forget about my problems.","I love the mall, and I love Howard Stern and Oprah.","I live for watching TV and partying with my book club.","The audition process for 'Are You There, Chelsea?' was overwhelming and exciting. It was my first pilot season and one of the first pilots I auditioned for.","When I was growing up, I watched every sitcom imaginable.","Getting to be the 'weird roommate' on a sitcom was a dream come true.","The secret to podcast success is sticking with it and making it fun for yourself.","The podcasts that keep my attention are those where I can feel the hosts and guests are enjoying themselves or are really passionate about the subject matter.","The connective tissue between storytelling, advice, and comedy is passion.","I think that by doing the podcast, I've grown to actually enjoy hosting a little more and realize that my role is a bit of a host, even though I thought I was totally avoiding that by creating this construct. But hosting a late night show has never really been a goal of mine in particular, but it could be fun.","That's what's so great, I get to play any character in the world. And I think that's one of the things that makes doing 'Comedy Bang Bang' or other improv podcasts so fun, as well as my own, is that you can really explore a character deeply for a long period of time that is nothing like yourself.","I'm really thankful for my improv background.","I think I was always a class clown growing up and a funny kid. I never really knew how to channel that until I got into high school.","So many of my characters have really crazy physicalities, so it's really fun to be able to say, like, 'I'm an elf who's the size of a dollar bill!'","Doing 'Comedy Bang! Bang!,' you have to play at the top of your abilities, so it is so fun to get that opportunity. I've grown a lot as a performer just working with those guys.","I feel like that would be pretty strange to meet a voice actor as a kid.","I would really like to create my own show. And I really wanna meet Oprah.","It's like, if you tweet anything about One Direction, you'll get a lot of hate - immediately. They're just searching the words and then writing back to anybody who writes about them.","I had always done broader characters, but going to UCB and speaking to my own voice was important for auditioning for TV and film.","It's really fun to play a character that fights back and say what she means.","Society is really coming to a point where they're not asking if women can be funny anymore. We all know they obviously are.","I love watching people tell stories, because it's very vulnerable.","I was invited to do an all-female improv festival in Portland called All Jane, No Dick. The person running it asked me if I had a female improv team, and I just said yes and then figured out who I would want to bring with me. We had such a fun show together that we decided that we should keep doing it.","You can't really get as much done when you're worried about looking gross.","A lot of my characters are born out of a small grain in a person that I heighten and take to that next level. They're not based on anyone I've ever met, but they are these extreme versions of something.","For me, what really excites me about my characters and what pushes their core is the kind of dark, sad side of life.","I've done 70 different characters on my podcast. But in terms of characters that I revisit a lot, I think there are 10 that I know more in-depth.","I kind of see it as my personal therapy to get on stage and do characters."],"Lauren Lee Smith":["I prefer to live in my own little bubble of my own reality.","My husband is pretty particular about his cars. In his opinion, the Mercedes are the best of the best.","The only place I really get recognized is at Ralphs. Whenever I'm in L.A., I go to Ralphs, and for some reason, everyone there recognizes me.","I actually have a weird tendency to say things to people that they were just about to say. I always freak my best friend out with that. So I might have a bit of psychic power.","It's always a bit strange when you join a show in the second season.","I actually prefer getting into roles that are the polar opposite of me; that's why I've done so many dark and dreary things.","It's one thing to be this 'tough chick,' but you also have to be likeable.","I don't think Mercedes-Benz says anything about me, really. I was in a situation where I was able to get a really nice car, and I'm proud to have it.","I'm actually not a very good driver, to be honest with you. I'm a scatterbrain driver. I'm not very focused. I'm always trying to find the right music station or put on a new CD or trying to eat something.","Every time I was driving on the L.A. freeway in a small car, it was very unnerving for me. One time I rented an SUV, and it just changed my whole perspective of driving, and I was converted to SUVs from that day on."],"Lauren London":["People should accept being single, because those are the moments you can really focus on yourself, and learning who you are. Then when you get in a relationship, you will be stronger and have a little bit more self-awareness, self-love, and the other ingredients for a healthy relationship.","I struggle with deciding when to answer or ignore the constant speculation about my private life, because I feel like that doesn't belong to anybody but me.","The serenity prayer, 'God grant me the strength to accept...' That's a prayer that's actually in my car. I say it every day.","Is being single hard? It depends where your mind is. If you are focused, being single is an enjoyable experience, but if you hate being alone, you'll hate being single. I think it depends on the individual are where they are in life.","Being a black woman, there's so many different sides of us. We are funny, silly, romantic, professional, smart, and we have good jobs.","So many people think being single is the end of something, but it's really a beginning - a good beginning.","Whatever your ethnicity is, in this life you are going to be on a journey to discover who you are and how you feel about yourself.","People see the 'Lil' Wayne' persona and think they know who he really is. My son's father is an intelligent, loving and lovable person who will always be a dear friend. That is all.","I love Barbra Streisand. Anybody who knows me knows I just love her, love her, love her!","I do remember being teased by my cousins on my mom's side for not being black enough. And then I'd spend the summer with my dad and be sent to all white summer camps where I was 'that black girl.'","I have a hard time watching myself! Usually I do the work, and then I leave it. So I pretend like I'm not on TV every week.","I'm still young; I've had a couple things under my belt. I don't even think I've begun where I'm gonna be eventually. I really feel very much in the beginning of my journey. I feel very new.","I was 16 and got my boyfriend's name tattooed on me. Don't do it. 'Cause it hurts. The moment you do it, the next month, the next year, you'll be broken up - trust me - and cover-ups hurt. You can show your love in other ways. Ink is not it. Write it on a piece of paper and mail it to him.","I feel like there is always a rumor that I'm dating someone that I never met before. People have their judgments and ideas of who I am, and they know nothing.","We keep secrets from people that we love because we're afraid of our own truth. I think sometimes we're afraid to hurt people, because you never know. I think we're afraid of what is, and what can't be.","I think that in any family - black, white, Chinese, Spanish, whatever - family is family. You know that there's dysfunction, and that there's this cousin who doesn't like this auntie. But, at the end of the day, like I say, love brings everybody together.","When love is absent, then there is fear, and in my opinion you should lead your entire life through love.","My first acting job - I used to do commercials, and I had done a couple music videos - but my first job job was 'ATL' with T.I. I auditioned for that, like, five times. I didn't have an agent. And then, from there, my life changed.","I've always been a performer. That's just what I know.","I would love to play Janis Gaye in the Marvin Gaye story. If they ever do the Marvin Gaye story, I would love to play Janis - just throwing that out there.","I don't have a lot of friends; most of the friends I have, I've had since high school.","For some odd reason, I like a man in sweatsuits. Obviously, you want your man to look good in a suit, but I like when men look comfortable, and the swagger just stands out of that.","I'm the little half-black, half-Jewish girl who was odd and awkward. I try to be myself.","Barbra Streisand has always been an inspiration for me. I admire Jennifer Lopez because she's been against all the odds, and she's made such a name for herself, and she can put her name on anything and it sells, and I admire that about her, but Barbara Streisand and Woody Allen are my favorites.","I like being in relationship because of the comfort it provides.","I love the art of acting, so whether I do it on film with a million people seeing me or I do it in front of 20 people in a class showcasing my art, I am going to act whether anyone sees it or everyone sees it.","I had a pregnancy that wasn't private... A lot of people had their opinions about it. They were surprised that I came up pregnant, which was a surprise to me, because I'm a woman, and women get pregnant, and Lauren comes first before the actress, so having my son was the best thing that ever happened to me.","I'm a great mother because of my intentions on being a great mother; I'm a good friend because I'm loyal; I'm a good daughter because I've hopefully made my mother proud; I'm a great human being because I accept that there's a spiritual being underneath it all. I've always been a woman of faith."],"Lauren Miller":["If someone else isn't making it happen for you, make it happen yourself.","It was really exciting to see how 'Bridesmaids' was accepted and how well it did.","I'm feeling pretty fortunate. I've been having lots of lovely auditions and meetings, so I'm savoring the moment.","I love comedy, and I think that's sort of what comes naturally to me.","Writing is such a weird emotional thing. It's hard. If you sit down with a plan to write something, it's going to be harder.","I wanted to stay in New York to pursue acting, but my dad urged me to get a four-year degree. Reading about the film school at Florida State University, he suggested I go there. I received my bachelor's degree in 2003.","After leaving ImageMovers, I sold two pitches to Fox Atomic, which I then wrote for them.","I went to film school, worked as an assistant, and wrote several scripts that haven't gotten made.","When you have a writing partner and you're writing a comedy, your goal is to make each other laugh.","From a very young age, I wanted to be an actor, but I lived in a very small town in Florida where there weren't any opportunities for that.","I'm definitely one of those people who think that everything you do leads up to the moment where you are now.","I went to film school, so I certainly know how to make things quickly and cheaply. But at the same time, I have the experience of working with Steve Starkey for three years. I watched him produce some gigantic movies.","Losing a parent over eight years is a very dark journey. I spent the first four years feeling bad and angry and sorry for myself.","When I was in my early twenties, my mom started repeating things, asking the same questions, telling the same stories. It was like, 'Oh, God, this is not right.' When I was 25, my brother and I finally told our dad we had to take her to the doctor.","'Bridesmaids' proved there was an audience there that we knew was there. It proved that women go to the movies. They want to see story about themselves.","Girls will go see anything. They're open and excited to go to the movies and laugh.","We have over an hour of footage with Ken Marino. Same with Kevin Smith. Because you never know, when you let people who are so talented at improv go, what you're going to get. You don't want to strangle them with your own words, because probably what they're going to say is way better."],"Lauren Myracle":["Kids are smart. Knowledge is power. Let them figure things out. Don't turn into that grown-up who they won't come to.","I know I seem really friendly, but I'm a closet introvert.","When guys talk about sex, eyebrows don't get raised. It's different for girls.","Every time I write a new book, I want to push myself to try something different.","Whatever you hold onto that you want to do, and that other people tell you you are foolish to want to do - don't give up.","Give your kid some credit for being smart - just because they read about something doesn't mean they will do it.","I don't shy from controversy. I'm telling stories, and I'll tell whatever story seems like it wants to be told.","Sometimes I worry I'm writing 'Fifty Shades of Grey' for teenagers, but I'm not.","God, it sucks to disappoint your parents, even at forty-two years old.","I understand why parents worry about books - they're worried about their kids. They want to keep their kids safe. But parents aren't always realistic.","I'm always drawn to the underdogs, to the people whose stories don't get told.","Being an author of banned books is cool, I've decided.","What I find cool about being a banned author is this: I'm writing books that evoke a reaction, books that, if dropped in a lake, go down not with a whimper but a splash.","Ideas matter. The world matters. Our lives matter, and the choices we make as we navigate our lives perhaps matter most of all.","It's neither my job nor within my capabilities to save people. But a book sure can try.","Kids need to see their world reflected back to them."],"Lauren Oliver":["You don't reach points in life at which everything is sorted out for us. I believe in endings that should suggest our stories always continue.","Dystopian novels help people process their fears about what the future might look like; further, they usually show that there is always hope, even in the bleakest future.","I think dystopian futures are also a reflection of current fears.","I love to sleep. I'm an excellent, excellent sleeper.","I often write two books simultaneously. Usually one of them starts out as a fun experiment designed to give me a daily break from the real book I'm writing. And then that becomes a real book too.","I think I'm able to do so much because writing is what I love to do. So, often when I have free time, I choose to write and edit.","I worked in publishing before I became an author, so I knew how a book gets made.","I have a beautiful pair of Giuseppe Zanotti black pumps that make me feel like a model every time I put them on. I have a pair of Jimmy Choo flats I would marry, if I could.","With 'Delirium,' I had to spend time thinking about the political, social and religious structure of a different world. But it was a fun challenge.","I think 'Voldemort' is definitely the scariest villain.","One of the things I've tried to do in my career is really write different kinds of books, so I'm able to broaden people's expectations of what I'm allowed to do.","I feel a lot of adult fiction looks down on plot as a lesser form of literature.","'Requiem' has been controversial because people don't feel I gave it closure.","There are times I wish I was more conventional. I would get a husband and a baby and a big SUV in the 'burbs and be happy. But forging my own way - my career, my relationships with wonderful but troubled people - that's who I am.","My parents were pretty liberal, but they were still parents. I definitely had my teenage rebellion.","I was a troubled teen and I was constantly looking for someone to throw me a rope. Those ropes are connections. They allow us to see that life exists beyond the little worlds we are currently a part of.","I think all artists are only interested in a couple of themes, really. I'm primarily interested in change and connection as being this restorative force. I write about them because that's what I think about in my own life.","Finishing books - and leaving the world you've created - is always a kind of emotionally wrenching experience. I usually cry.","I try to write characters that are as real, emotionally and psychologically, as I can make them; I feel the same way about setting. This often means that I'm drawing from my experiences and observations."],"Lauren Potter":["I've had tons of bullies who would call me retarded, even on my Facebook page. It's sad and it really hurts. I want to tell people not to use the word. Don't say your friend's retarded when they do something foolish. If you have a disability, keep working hard. Whatever it takes, do it, and don't be mean to people.","I want to encourage kids to speak up, to tell their stories. That is the only way people will know what we have to go through. Believe in yourself. Someone once told me being different isn't bad - different is just different!","I hope that when people with Down's see me, they will be inspired to do more than they think they can.","I get mail from people all over the world now from people who tell me that they didn't really understand Down syndrome, but because of me they have read about it and studied it and now they know a lot more about it.","A long time ago when I was very little, I dreamed about being on stage. Some people told me I would never be able to do it, so I only paid attention to those who told me that I could.","Like so many other kids with special needs, I have been bullied. Kids in elementary school made me eat sand, and those same boys would walk behind me, teasing me. Finally I had enough, and I told them to grow up.","It feels amazing to be a role model for people with and without disabilities.","Lots of people with little kids or babies with Down syndrome tell me they aren't afraid of the future for their child because of what I am doing to help people understand it better.","I love working on 'Glee,' and I hope that there are more and more parts for me and other actors with Down syndrome in television and in movies so I can keep working for a long, long time.","I've spoken in front of members of the U.S. Congress about a new dream of living in communities where everybody is welcome and everyone can live and go to school and work without facing the fear of bullies.","I am on the International Board of Best Buddies, and I am also working with Special Olympics, and with The Arc to help people with disabilities become more independent and more included in their communities.","I was recently appointed by President Obama to the President's Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities. I am so excited that the President trusts me to advise him on things that are important to people with disabilities!"],"Lauren Santo Domingo":["If there's one thing you can say about my apartment it's that it's constantly evolving, constantly changing. I think that is the mark of a good apartment; you can never really be done - It's like a proper wardrobe.","Fashion and decor should amuse you and your friends.","There is so much more fashion coverage online, so women today are really seeing the collections. They're a lot savvier and more aware of the discrepancies between what they see on the runway and what they end up seeing in their local shops."],"Lauren Shuler Donner":["The first two actors we cast were Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Because we started so highbrow, we were able to get anyone. Plus, some of these people have children, and their kids love 'X-Men.' They'll do it because of them - that's our little extra ace in the hole.","I'm a huge fan, and I didn't grow up with it, I didn't grow up reading 'X-Men' comics. I became a huge fan; I had somebody in my company who gave me the biographies of all the characters. I read Logan's first and was like, 'What a great, tragic character.' I just loved him.","Almost everyone I know is battling something, whether it's allergies or depression. Whatever it is, it makes you feel less than who you are. I believe part of life's challenge is to work through that.","I've been looking for an opportunity to break into the Chinese market due to its devoted and passionate audience and have found the perfect partner in Cristal Pictures.","Not many people know 'Hellblazer.'","You have to have somebody to root for. I truly believe that's how you ground a movie. You ground them in the characters.","I'm dying to do a 'Gambit' movie with Channing Tatum.","I really liked 'Walk The Line,' and I really liked 'Girl Interrupted,' and I really liked '3:10 To Yuma.'","I personally have close ties to Marvel because of Kevin Feige, because Kevin worked for me.","For me, I think Bob Iger is one of the smartest men in the country.","We love 'X-Force.' It allows us to be a little grittier.","The thing about Texas is that it's a little larger than life.","I love to say that what's great about 'Legion' is that if you haven't read a comic book and you haven't seen an 'X-Men' movie, you can come in and understand it - and this can be your comic.","My mandate to myself since I've been involved in these movies was 'make every single movie different, so there's never 'X-Men' fatigue.'","I grew up outside Cleveland, Ohio, and I went to college at Boston University. I majored in film. Then I came out to Los Angeles.","The first movie I produced was a movie that Joel Schumacher wrote and directed called 'Amateur Night at the Dixie Bar and Grill.'","The first writer I developed a script with was John Hughes, and that was 'Mr. Mom.' That was my first feature film.","I think people really don't understand what a producer does versus what a director does. I mean, the producer is often the person that is on the movie the longest - it's their material that they are then bringing the director onto to bring it to the screen. Are we overlooked? Absolutely.","When I first set out to make movies, that's what I thought I was going to do - make movies that mean something. And each movie had its own message, some stronger than others. Even 'X-Men' has its own message of tolerance.","I was attracted to the comics because of the characters and, particularly, Wolverine because he is so complex. He is so damaged and tragic in many ways - he doesn't have his memory. His body was invaded. He has unrequited love for Jean Grey.","The thrill of doing television versus features is, in television, you get to focus more on the characters.","I'm obsessed with 'Peaky Blinders.' Those characters are awful, and yet you root for them. You love them! Same with 'Breaking Bad.'","The cinematic universe will not worry about 'Legion.' They will not worry about these TV worlds at all.","The thematic core of 'X-Men' is tolerance. It's that for those of us who are different in any way - in a big way, whether it's you're a minority, you're a woman, you're a Muslim, you are suppressed or marginalized - it can go the whole spectrum - but even if you are shy or you feel like an outsider - and X-Men are outsiders.","I didn't tell anyone I had lupus for many, many years, and I didn't tell anyone I had cancer. I was afraid no one would hire me, and I also felt it was deeply personal. It was nobody's business. Now, of course, my feelings have changed.","I wanted to tell people you can live a full life, even if you're not feeling well.","When I was in my 20s, I was always sick. I was always feeling exhausted.","I would say that the first 'X-Men' was the hardest. It took us a long time to get it going.","I feel fortunate every day I'm in this business. No matter how hard it is, no matter how ruthless some people are, I was born to do this; I was born for movies.","Don't take rejection personally.","Sometimes, I've had the experience with a director where I didn't share the same vision of the movie.","I like having an idea, or hearing an idea, and getting it into a proper script.","Producing is figuring out how to make each character have a distinct voice, how to make the story twist and turn - that's the biggest challenge.","People would congratulate Dick for my movies. It bothered me for a long, long time.","Dick understands what I go through. He understands the difficulty and the brutality of the business.","People would ask for my autograph because they had never seen a woman behind the camera before.","I've really tried to use the power of film to effect change.","The accomplishment that I am most proud of is that 'Free Willy' and 'Dave' got a political message out, which isn't easy to do within the constraints of studio moviemaking.","In the past, I've been a workaholic. I'm trying not to be anymore.","It was a fear we had when we started 'Legion,' that there were too many comic-book series out there, and how do you stand out. Our mandate always is to make something different in feel and tone. You try to avoid someone thinking, 'Gee, I've seen this before.'","I stayed in the East for about a year after I graduated. Then, I came out to Los Angeles and started knocking on doors and working my way up. This was the '70s. I had been told how tough it was for a woman trying to make it in Hollywood, but I sort of had blinders on. I just did things anyway.","I've been very fortunate, but it also never occurred to me that I couldn't do something or that I couldn't ask if I could try something."],"Lauren Socha":["Derby born and bred, mate.","It's dead nice to know I've achieved something.","I want to do theatre and I want to do period drama.","I'm ready for theatre. I'm ready for dramas, period stuff, films. I want to achieve everything.","No one understands my accent. I'm constantly going to auditions and being told they don't like how I talk. You have to live with criticism, and I don't take it personally.","I'd love to be in a period drama, though my dream role is to be in a film with Ray Winstone and Tom Hardy.","I couldn't hope to be in anything better than 'Misfits.' The reaction from fans has been mental. The weirdest thing is when people tell me I'm their inspiration. I can't believe I get fan mail, and loads of free clothes. Adidas sent me lots of stuff; it's wicked!","I love playing serious! That's a relief for me. It means something. It sounds dead corny and cheesy, but on a day-to-day basis, you can't just let loose and cry. So as an actress playing those gritty roles, I can play it quite decently."],"Lauren Southern":["This is what's hard: I know I'm legally a man, but I'm also male-minded, despite having the female appearance.","I don't know why legal immigration even exists anymore when I can just put on some bronzer, get on a dingy boat, and just show up at the beaches of Sicily with the Koran in my hand.","It seems as though our leaders have almost forgotten about legal immigration and are just leaving our borders open, which is a detriment culturally, financially, and in a lot of other realms for native people.","I think women need to empower themselves instead of asking for handouts.","There's this ridiculous idea that I'm a gender traitor because I'm not a feminist. I'm supposed to be part of a sisterhood: you're automatically supposed to support all women just because you have the same genitals as them, which doesn't make sense.","It's kind of hard to retain the feminine. I have so much respect for the feminine, but it's actually something I have to work for.","I'm totally open to changing my beliefs. I could grow up to be a total communist. I could grow up to be a Neocon. I'm looking to have my views challenged. I'm looking to be corrected.","I judge people based on merit, on personality.","When people put effort in life, it's more beautiful. But it doesn't come naturally to me.","I don't think the alt-right would call me alt-right. They call me alt-lite, usually. I just consider myself a nationalist or a traditionalist.","I try to surround myself with the people who genuinely believe in changing things, that are angry about it and want to make changes and want to make a change and are willing."],"Lauren Stamile":["Math is a language that you use to describe statistics, but really it's about collecting information and putting it in an order that makes sense.","There was an assistant professor I kind of had a crush on, but I was far too awkward and far too nervous to ever say anything.","I'd seen the movie 'Paranormal Activity' and was convinced for weeks that it was real.","I learn an amazing amount from watching television and movies because if you watch things that really work and don't work, it teaches you so much about what you do for your own craft. I think that if you're auditioning for a show, you need to know the world of the show, or you can't represent it very well."],"Lauren Tarshis":["I had learning problems when I was in elementary school, and didn't really start to read well until high school. I never read any of the middle grade classics that were popular when I was young - 'Harriet the Spy', 'Charlotte's Web', 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond', 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'.","The most important advice I can offer is that writing is a craft that you can learn by practicing. If you keep writing, you will improve.","Many writers are afraid of writing something bad, so they don't try or give up when their efforts don't lead to a masterpiece right away. If you work at it, you will improve.","In quiet moments, I love to read."],"Lauren Tom":["One of the great joys of my life post-'Friends' has been being approached by Asian women who have told me how much it meant to see an Asian face on their TV screen when they were growing up.","I do think it's getting better, but I have noticed that Asians are not well represented in awards shows, and not a ton of Asian faces on the big screen either. Perhaps some of the young Asian actors who are on TV series now will be seen in upcoming movies in the near future - Jamie Chung, Constance Wu, Suzy Nakamura, to name a few. Fingers crossed.","If I was blond and tall, then I would have had 10 times the competition. I auditioned steadily and performed for everyone who would hire me. Now I am in a position to pick and choose my roles.","When kids would say 'Ching Chong Chinaman,' I thought they were talking to someone behind me. I used to think I was a white Jewish girl named Rebecca or Rachel.","What if everything I thought was wrong with me was actually right with me? You have to have the courage to show who you are to the world.","I've been to 25 psychics so far. I've even gone to see a woman called 'the mother' who just hugs you.","From the time I was little, I always felt like an outsider. I always felt nervous and uncomfortable with myself.","What I've realized is that, especially in Los Angeles, a lot of people are on some kind of path, even if they're not completely conscious of it. I've sort of always been on a path to find more peace, more security within myself. I've always felt like I needed something to help me feel better.","I was supposed to go to Northwestern and become a dental hygienist, get married, have babies. My father was very against me being in show business. Usually in Chinese culture, education is the most highly valued.","When 'Joy Luck Club' came out, I kind of became a role model for the Asian acting community. I started to talk at colleges and emcee charity things. I'm much more connected to my sense of being Asian now."],"Lauren Velez":["After 'Dexter' and 'La Lupe', I would love to return to theater. I'm just ready for more.","'La Lupe' is my passion project. I've done it as a one-woman show, but I'm raising money to turn it into a film. It's a story of a Cuban singer who became the Queen of Latin Soul, the first woman on the N.Y. salsa scene.","I'm much more ambitious than I'd like to admit.","When I first came out to L.A., Hollywood's idea of a Latina was Mexican. It was almost like they had never seen or heard of an Afro-Latina before.","I don't have children, but I have 17 nieces and nephews, and they more than make up for anything that I can do. I have a stepdaughter, and I adore her to pieces, and I think about adoption. There are so many kids at different ages and stages that need families."],"Lauren Weisberger":["There is no panic you can't allay, no problem you can't solve.","I am obsessed with planning travel! Not just traveling, which I love, but the whole planning process and all the details that go into it. I subscribe to all these travel blogs and airline forums and research hotels and activities and destinations for hours on end, and I volunteer to plan trips for everyone I know.","I'm not a person who would get up at 5 A.M. to write, but I could sacrifice my Friday night and just order in dinner, sit at home and get into it.","Of course I consider myself a Jewish writer - I am one! All of the protagonists in my five books have been Jewish, and I wouldn't be surprised if all my future main characters were as well.","So much of my own life inspires what I write. Whether it's work, family, friends, motherhood, I am a writer who tends to write what she knows. In 'Revenge Wears Prada,' a great deal of my own life finds its way into the book.","Sadly, the only constant in my writing environment stems from some inexplicable need to listen to the news. CNN loops over and over in the background from the time I wake until the time I finally, blessedly, fall asleep.","I've read pretty broadly on the Holocaust - both fiction and non-fiction - and to me, 'The Lost Wife' is one of the best. The horrors of war serve as a backdrop to a love affair that spans a lifetime, and that love story stayed with me long after I put down the book.","After my second, I started working with a nutritionist who specializes in post-baby weight loss. It's called Simply Beautiful Mom. I'm in restaurants all the time because of work, and she actually will look at menus online before I go and she says, 'These are the three things you're allowed to order. Don't even open a menu.'","So much of writing is done alone in a room in sweatpants, with only the Internet for company.","I admit to subscribing to all the celebrity rags. The best part of being an author is if the celebs aren't being ridiculous enough, you can just make it up.","I love clothes, but I love them in a very 'regular person' way.","I'm a child of the '80s, so like everyone else, I love all those classic, formative movies - 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off,' 'Pretty in Pink,' 'Sixteen Candles,' 'Dirty Dancing,' etc., with 'St. Elmo's Fire' and 'The Breakfast Club' existing on a separate, slightly higher plane.","The closest I get to any sort of 'designer' items would probably be my weakness for jeans - they don't have to be any particular brand, but I'm willing to do almost anything, go anywhere, spend obscene amounts of money for that elusive 'perfect pair.'","I think that anyone who likes writing views 'The New Yorker' as the, you know, pinnacle of the publishing world. If you get 50 words published in 'The New Yorker,' it's more important than 50 articles in other places. So, would I love to one day write for them? I guess. But that's not my sole ambition.","I definitely like clothes as much as the next girl, just not to the extent of people who work in the fashion industry.","If I could figure out a way to earn a living while traveling for the rest of my life, well, I think that'd be a dream come true.","Friends would not say I'm a laid-back person by any means.","Naturally, I mine my girlfriends' lives for good anecdotes and stories - so many of their experiences find their way into my books.","I'm addicted to 'Lonely Planet' guides. Naturally, I'll buy one whenever I take a trip somewhere, but it goes beyond that: I've begun buying them for cities and countries I just hope to visit one day.","I have a whole iPod full of exceptionally bad music, truly awful stuff including a disproportionate number of one hit wonders from the early '80s and lots of hair bands. I find it utterly impossible to love a song until I know every single word, so listening to live music or new bands is pretty much out.","I'm always in search of those books where you don't want to stop reading, and 'Me Before You' is at the top of that list.","It's the hardest thing in the world to dedicate to writing, but if you do that even once a week, after six months or a year you'll have something substantial.","Here in New York, we're media obsessed. Writers write about writers who write about writers and reporters and freelancers, and it's just a festival of information. We're all analyzing and examining and predicting, and I can't imagine that it's like that everywhere else.","As long as I'm able to actually maintain a career where I can write full-time, I'll be thrilled.","I got an offer at 'Vogue.' And I desperately wanted to work in magazines. My interest wasn't in fashion, but when you get an offer right out of college for a magazine that big - I decided that it was probably better to start at a big name magazine, even if I wasn't necessarily fascinated with the subject."],"Lauren Willig":["Every young girl wants to be a princess. Then, when you find a real-life one, it's very easy to imagine yourself in that role.","My books fall in the wobbly middle between historical fiction and historical romance.","Iris Johansen's lovers weathered the sack of city states and the vagaries of the French Revolution; Judith McNaught's heroines endured amnesia, social ostracism and misunderstandings so big they deserved their own ZIP code.","'Purple Plumeria' I dithered over for months and then wrote the whole thing between the beginning of July and end of August. The dithering and procrastination time was three times the writing times.","One of our fundamental human needs is finding our partner that we hope we will stay with for the rest of our lives. You often find the same search in other genres. The mystery novel has a romance subplot. Literary novels often focus on that relationship but do not often end well.","Ever since reading Jean Plaidy's 'Queen in Waiting,' I've felt deep admiration for Caroline of Ansbach.","I'm an eighteenth-century girl at heart. I wouldn't mind being set down in London in 1715, in the midst of all the drama of the Hanoverian succession.","Romance tends to be the whipping boy of genre fiction.","People who would never sneer at sci-fi and murder mysteries have no trouble damning the whole romance genre without reading one.","I think sex is a very minor part of most romance novels.","I couldn't make myself write serious; I was surrounded by serious: in monographs, in articles, in my own dissertation prospectus, in the very earnest e-mails of students telling me just why that paper couldn't be in on time, cross their hearts and hope to get an A-minus.","Did I invent anything? I don't think so, not really. But if I've helped make history fun... then my work here is done.","There's a horrible stereotype of both the romance writer and the romance reader as somehow undereducated and unprofessional, when in fact there are a number of incredibly well-educated professional women who have chosen to leave their other careers and go into writing romance.","I've been typed as historical fiction, historical women's fiction, historical mystery, historical chick lit, historical romance - all for the same book.","I never sat down and said, 'I'm going to write historical fiction with strong romantic elements.' It was just the way the stories went.","I've had mainstream readers complain that the book is really a romance, and romance readers complain that the book isn't a romance - with the same book! It really depends on the individual reader's expectations going into the story, and that's very hard to predict person to person.","When I was 6, a family friend gave me E.L. Konigsburg's 'A Proud Taste for Scarlet and Miniver' and launched me on a full-blown Eleanor obsession. I wanted to ride off on Crusade, to launch a thousand troubadour songs, to marry a king - and then jilt him and marry another.","Like everyone else, I grew up loving the Anne books, but L.M. Montgomery is so much more. Like Jane Austen, she has an eye for the absurd and a gift for the 'mot juste.'","As a friend once pointed out, the crotchety dowagers do tend to get all the best lines. That may be why I have so many of them in my books.","Say what you will about Queen Eleanor, she was a savvy, quick-witted woman who made her mark on history. And as the founder of the Courts of Love, what better patron monarch could there be for a romantic novelist?","My official field was Tudor-Stuart England; I also considered myself reasonably competent when it came to Renaissance and Reformation Europe.","My own inclination is to skew towards humor. They say that some people view life as a comedy, others as a tragedy. Me? Comedy all the way.","I tend to navigate by indirection, meaning that most of the major things in my life have happened when I've been thinking about something else.","I went to grad school with the grand plan of getting my Ph.D. and writing weighty, Tudor-Stuart-set historical fiction - from which I emerged with a law degree and a series of light-hearted historical romances about flower-named spies during the Napoleonic wars.","I hadn't realized quite how intense the first few years of grad school would be. When you're being assigned 40 books a week... there's not much room for novels.","I'm not sure that teaching a Core course is necessarily the best introduction to teaching.","If I stay in academia, I might end up going someplace random.","The minimum I need is six months to allow for dithering, procrastination and the research. The research times varies from book to book; some are faster because they're based off resources I have at my disposal.","When I'm in heavy-duty writing mode, there's something great about reading a series. Soothing, but not distracting too much."],"Lauren Worsham":["It really is like a disease. I just couldn't get away from the theater.","I played Jonathan Livingston Seagull in a musical version of 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' in Austin, TX. It was pretty special.","I was actually tone deaf until I had tumors in my ears - I had very small ear canals - removed. Once they fixed that, I was actually able to sing in a pleasant manner.","My brother sings. My brother is a singer-songwriter. His name is Parker Ainsworth. He changed his last name to his middle name.","Austin is a big music town, so growing up, I had a lot of local heroes. Toni Price I was very, very into; she was one of the first people I tried to emulate. She's a local Austin blues artist. Marsha Paul I was also a very big fan of.","Growing up, the dream was to be on Broadway. I always loved theater.","I love rock and opera, and I love musical theater, and I don't want to lose any of that.","I was one of those kids who liked a lot of attention. I was always the kid in class who'd be telling jokes and getting in trouble. Theater was a natural way for me to channel that and also become a productive member of society.","Really, the impetus driving me is I've always sung, but I like to act, I like drama, I like text, which is why opera is something I've come late to, I'd say.","I only worked theater jobs, but they were all really silly when I first graduated. I was a line monitor at 'Spamalot,' which means I got there at 8 A.M. and told people how much the tickets were for standing room. I was an NYU Medical School fake patient, to teach doctors how to talk to patients.","After 'Spelling Bee,' I started landing more jobs... I got 'Candide' at New York City Opera."],"Laurence D. Fink":["To finance longer life spans, we must convince individuals to start investing now for the long term. But longevity should be an asset that can be levered, not a curse. They must understand that there's a cost to sitting in cash. No one talks about that cost.","One of the key elements of human behavior is, humans have a greater fear of loss than enjoyment of success. All the academic studies will show you that the fear of loss of capital is far greater than the enjoyment of gains.","Social Security is an insurance policy. It's a terrible investment vehicle. Social Security has some great benefits. But it was never meant to be a savings plan. So we need to have a national debate. Should this 12.5 percent that we're contributing all go into a Social Security pool, or should half go into a mandatory savings plan?","What Wall Street is, they're market makers. Wall Street's business model is making money on velocity of money. They're a click industry. That's what Wall Street is. They make a lot of money when there's a lot of turnover. And they make a lot of money when that velocity is fast.","I like multinational companies. They may have 40 to 60 percent of their engines of growth in the United States, but I do like the diversification of being more global.","I am responsible for managing more schoolteachers' and firemen's money than anybody in the world. That's an enormous responsibility.","I am pleased to be part of Promontory's steady efforts to assist banks and other financial firms in meeting legal and regulatory obligations and challenges.","When you look at dividend returns on equities versus bond yields, to me it's a pretty easy decision to be heavily in equities.","I personally have said many times I'd be a hundred percent in equities. That fits my risk profile and my views of the world, though obviously it's not appropriate for everyone. Most investors need a more diversified portfolio."],"Laurence Fishburne":["On a motorcycle, you can't really think about more than where you are. There's a freedom that comes with that - from stress, worry, sweating the small stuff.","I don't think Othello is a jealous man - he is a man who has been deceived by another person, just as everybody in the play is deceived by that person... The playwright uses the word 'jealousy' over and over and over again, but I don't think it has anything to do with being jealous.","Special effects are characters. Special effects are essential elements. Just because you can't see them doesn't mean they aren't there.","Acting is a childlike thing. To act well, you have to be childlike in order to free yourself.","I'm left-handed: I can think and feel at the same time. My feminine side is very highly developed.","My mother is quite a woman. She would push me, and when I got tired of her pushing, I'd say: 'Leave me alone. Don't push so much.'","What I continue to learn as a parent is to be mindful of the fact that I am responsible for being the parent that my children need me to be and not necessarily the parent I want to be.","I didn't want to be a big star. I wanted to be a really good actor.","I think of myself as being a relatively intelligent man who is open to a lot of different things and I think that questioning our purpose in life and the meaning of existence is something that we all go through at some point.","I came up around people who took acting seriously, who cared about acting, cared about the theater and, in the '70s, made movies that said something that mattered. I came up with those people, and I was a kid. Their ethos and credo became mine.","In order to be the best version of yourself, you have to dedicate time, effort, and support to other people who need it.","There's a bunch of plays that I never got to do because I was either too young or too old for the parts, like 'Slow Dance on the Killing Ground' and 'Dutchman.' For 'American Buffalo,' I was the wrong color.","John Wick is not a guy that asks for help, so when he goes to somebody for help, whoever that is, you know he's a serious cat.","I didn't have much of a childhood, but that's O.K. I have a livelihood.","If you like rock and roll, if you like rhythm and blues, if you like jazz, if you like hip-hop, you might be black-ish.","I have a man cave somewhere in California - a totally undisclosed location where manly things occur. There are motorcycles, there are secret doors and passageways. Women are welcome, but they must knock.","I have this unshakeable faith. I believe in myself; I believe in God.","Paulo Coelho's 'The Alchemist' means a lot to me.","I work with my instincts. I don't have a process that I learned in an acting class whereby I break a script down or whereby I do a certain kind of research.","My production company, what we are trying to do is I'm trying to create content that speaks to me, and it's not one color. It's not one size fits all.","I have heard a lot of people talk about this grind of series television. I have not seen it yet.","I certainly believe that being in contact with one's spirit and nurturing one's spirit is as important as nurturing one's body and mind. We are three dimensional beings: body, mind, spirit.","I think everyone is very surprised at how 'Matrix' has become the pop culture phenomenon that it is.","I've played a lot of bad guys, 'cause that was the only work I could get. People saw my face and went 'oooh'.","Mine were informal mentors. They were all in my working life.","You know, whatever happens between the two of us that's created when we come together as actors is not something I think we can explain.","I play characters. I don't think I really have a persona per se. I don't play the same guy every time. I show up, you don't know what I'm gonna do. I like it that way. I've intentionally tried to do it that way. I think that's what's interesting.","It's funny, a lot of people think I take myself seriously because I come off so serious sometimes. But it's not that I take myself seriously, I take what I do seriously.","When I first read 'Boyz,' I cried. It could have been about some kids in Warsaw, Poland. I knew it was good, but I had no idea what it would do to me.","I can't remember a picture that has expressed black attitudes and personal relationships as vividly as we've done in 'Cadence.'","It's nice to get the feedback from a theater audience. It's a gas.","Doing theater makes you feel like a real actor.","I think any city that does the Olympics takes on the world and has to grow and has to kind of assimilate all sorts of folks.","If you asked someone who was a Maori about how they felt about how they were treated in Australia or New Zealand, you'll get an answer. They'll have something to tell you. And you might not like what you hear.","I always want to read the script and know everything and at least understand the context of the world that you're in and why you're there and all that stuff. It's good to know something. I like to know, but I've never been one of these, 'Just show me my stuff,' no, I like to know what the whole picture is so I can understand how I fit into it.","I'm not dyeing my hair and trying to pretend I'm 40. That's not going to work for me.","People think my name is Morpheus. Many times, people will say to me, 'Morpheus!' and I will complete the sentence by saying, 'is not my name!'","It's a huge blessing to know you've done something that has affected people the way 'The Matrix' has. It's like, there's 'Star Wars,' and then there's 'The Matrix.' It's cool to be a part of that.","My vocation is I do what I do. I'm an actor; that's what I do.","It's always a collective group of people coming together to oppose those things which are fundamentally contrary to our basic humanity.","We don't really see a lot of war movies about the people that are left behind, dealing with the deaths of those who serve and the sacrifices they make.","It's very difficult to set a film in one setting without giving the audience some intensity and some relief.","'The Fugitive Kind,' 'Rope,' 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' - I watched all these as a way of reminding myself that you can do a movie based on a play. You can do a movie that stays in one place for a long stretch.","I try to stay in shape a little bit, but I don't obsess about it.","When I came into my adulthood, I recognized how fortunate I was to be doing what I loved to do.","Philanthropic work reminds you of everyone's common humanity, and that's really the common denominator for everyone.","Acting and philanthropy are braided together. I've tried to seek out things that speak not just specifically to the community that created me, but that speak in a way that's universal and all of humanity celebrates.","When I think of Othello, I think of a poet-warrior. Let me say that again - a romantic warrior. And I think I have those qualities in common with him.","I ain't afraid of germs, man. And I ain't afraid of getting sick.","Doing 'CSI: N.Y.' is not 'CSI.' Doing 'CSI: Miami' is not 'CSI: N.Y.,' it's 'CSI: Miami.' It has a very, very specific tone. It has a very specific look. It has a specific way in which they tell their stories that's different from 'CSI: N.Y.' and 'CSI.'","Shooting a film with seven to eight actors together is complicated sometimes because you have to cover everybody.","I don't ever get to the point where anything is old hat.","I had two times in my life where I wanted to give up everything I worked for, but God gave me a job.","I believe in my children. I believe in human beings. I believe in the goodness that is in human beings. I believe in many, many things that I cannot prove. I believe that there's the world of the seen and the world of the unseen.","As a movie star, you get good tables at restaurants.","I think I've certainly learned a lot of lessons in humility and continue to work on that part of myself.","You can't be bad when you're working with a kid. They have the instincts that all great actors have.","Some characters need to be more performance-orientated; some, you have to be still.","Projects don't need to be special for me to sign up, but I do need them to have something that speaks to me in some way.","Things have become considerably better for men of colour since I was born. But I'd say that we'll be really getting somewhere when things get better for women of colour.","'Apocalypse Now' was my craziest experience ever. I was 14 years old, and I'd lied about my age to get the role. I haven't had another film top it.","Anytime we're talking about Thurgood Marshall, that's a good thing, I think, because it gives us an opportunity to go back, look at the history, and recognize what his contributions were.","I actually had the opportunity to stand at the lectern in the Supreme Court and face the justices, which was really a powerful thing for me.","I have taken care of my gift, and because I've taken care of my gift, I feel like I've been continually and constantly blessed to get to do wonderful things.","I don't necessarily go out and try to do something that's going to be just something that will please the audience. I'm not interested in doing something where I get the most people to come see the movie at the same time and they get the biggest explosion. I'm not interested in that.","The commercial I did for Kia was hilarious and unexpected, so that, I think, is also another way of signaling to the audience that there's more to me than Morpheus.","I think there's going to be many special episodes of 'Blackish.'","I learned tolerance at a very early age.","Having 50 to 60 years on the planet should give you a sense of how to master the way you look and live your life.","I try to meditate.","The 50s are the age of elegance. That's kind of my intention when I get dressed: casual elegance.","I certainly believe that being in contact with one's spirit and nurturing one's spirit is as important as nurturing one's body and mind.","We are three dimensional beings: body, mind, spirit.","I have a relationship with the southern hemisphere that's a really good one. I love it there.","It's my luck that I was born a bit of an old soul, and it's served me well.","My company, Cinema Gypsy, produced a podcast, 'Bronzeville,' in conjunction with Larenz Tate and his brothers that we're developing into a television show. It deals with a very tight-knit African-American community in Chicago in 1947 and people who run a numbers wheel.","I'm passionate about all the things I do, really.","I always wanted to play a cowboy. I just didn't get to do it the way I thought I would."],"Laurence Fox":["There are two main jobs in acting - the first one is to be a good actor, and the second one is to convince everyone that you're a good actor.","You could probably go three or four months without the word 'God' coming from my dad's mouth; Mum would pray for a parking space.","I could do Daniel Day-Lewis's job as well as him.","Acting can be a great job, but you do have to make up things to do when you're not working.","It suits me to be in a series that takes ages to film.","You're an actor - people judge you and criticize you, and praise you and say you're great in equal measure.","Becoming a parent gives you access to a whole world of feeling. It gives you a much stronger sense of life and death: becoming a father made me realise my own mortality.","I once blurted out that I found it impossible to bond with my son Winston because I was too tired. I mean how bloody awful does that sound? What a tosser!","I'm useless scrabbling around at home. I get on everyone's nerves, including my own. I'm not very good at amusing myself.","I'll say my dad couldn't act to save his life and nor can my uncle, and they'll say I'm the worst actor in the world.","I think we should be able to work until we want to stop, which is what I'm going to have to do.","Every time I've been to Los Angeles, I've hated it. My brother works there, so I usually go each year for a holiday.","I'm a very good packer, but I probably take too much in the way of toiletries. You only really need a toothbrush, as most places you go to have a bar of soap and some shampoo.","There is a guilty pleasure in being rude and knowing that it's acting rather than you. But you get the same release as if you were being rude in life.","I write and play music. I'd like to be a musician at some point."],"Laurence Housman":["The mere dates of my existence do not interest me, except in one connection. When the Great War started I was too old to be acceptable as a volunteer; when conscription followed I was too old to be conscripted.","I shall not die young, for I am already near seventy: I may die old.","Two more years were to go by before I knew anything about William Blake. Many years later, when his wife died, my godfather gave me the two books as a remembrance.","If I loved all the world as I do you, I shouldn't write books to it: I should only write letters to it, and that would be only a clumsy stage on the way to entire telepathy.","But it has also enabled me to find my feet as a lecturer and a reader of my own plays to audiences who like to hear them; and that experience of immediate appreciation gives greater pleasure and more stimulus towards further activity than even the most laudatory of reviews.","For the last half of my life I have had the doubtful benefit of a brother whose literary reputation is much greater than my own.","I believe absolutely in love being the central motive force of the universe.","I had never thought of myself as a dramatist, and, for really good technical results, the thought came too late: a man of letters has become too wordy to write economically for the stage.","I have always been a writer of letters, and of long ones; so, when I first thought of writing a book in the form of letters, I knew that I could do it quickly and easily.","I still think that if the human race, or even one nation, could only get right about its God the rest would follow.","I was just then going through a healthy reaction from the orthodoxy of my youth; religion had become for me not so much a possession as an obsession, which I was trying to throw off, and this iconoclastic tale of an imaginary tribe was the result.","If I live for another ten years I shall probably have written all that I want to write.","It is right and natural that generous minds while in the twenties should think the books which try to reform the world's wrong the greatest of all.","It is the sincerest thing I have written, caught by the drama of a soul struggling in the contrary toils of love and religion - death brought them into harmony.","It was then, I think, that I discovered that the best way of bringing a medieval subject home to my generation was not to be medieval in its treatment.","Life is the most versatile thing under the sun; and in the pursuit of life and character the author who works in a groove works in blinkers.","My best chance is that, in a happy moment, I hit upon St Francis as the subject for a series of plays. Others might have written them better: but, as I have written them, the advantage will probably remain mine.","My brother used to say that I wrote faster than he could read. He wrote two books - of poems - better than all mine put together.","My failure, during the first five or six years of my art training, to get set in the right direction, and the disappointment which it caused me, drove me the more persistently into writing as an alternative.","On that other novels followed: but I still wrote fairy tales and dreamy poems of another world.","Prosecution I have managed to avoid; but I have been arrested, charged in a police court, have refused to be bound over, and thereupon have been unconditionally released - to my great regret; for I have always wanted to know what going to prison was like.","Suicide is possible, but not probable; hanging, I trust, is even more unlikely; for I hope that, by the time I die, my countrymen will have become civilised enough to abolish capital punishment.","That was luck: I should not then have been a conscientious objector; but I am quite sure that the abominations of war would have made me one, as soon as I got to the front.","The man who bears my name, and who claims to be me, was born on July 15, 1865, the sixth in a family of seven. He was an ugly child, and remained ugly till his eighteenth year, when his looks gradually improved.","The modern form of things had begun to appeal to me, also (as material for satire) politics, and the lives of the great and little, high up in the social scale."],"Laurence J. Peter":["Speak when you are angry - and you'll make the best speech you'll ever regret.","The seaman tells stories of winds, the ploughman of bulls; the soldier details his wounds, the shepherd his sheep.","Lead, follow, or get out of the way.","If two wrongs don't make a right, try three.","A man doesn't know what he knows until he knows what he doesn't know.","If a cluttered desk is the sign of a cluttered mind, what is the significance of a clean desk?","In a hierarchy, every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence.","The best intelligence test is what we do with our leisure.","Competence, like truth, beauty, and contact lenses, is in the eye of the beholder.","If you don't know where you're going, you will probably end up somewhere else.","Fortune knocks but once, but misfortune has much more patience.","Going to church doesn't make you any more a Christian than going to the garage makes you a car.","America is a land of taxation that was founded to avoid taxation.","Bureaucracy defends the status quo long past the time when the quo has lost its status.","Every girl should use what Mother Nature gave her before Father Time takes it away.","It's better to have loved and lost than to have to do forty pounds of laundry a week.","Don't believe in miracles - depend on them.","Against logic there is no armor like ignorance.","An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn't happen today.","You can always tell a real friend: when you've made a fool of yourself he doesn't feel you've done a permanent job.","Expert: a man who makes three correct guesses consecutively.","When in doubt or danger, run in circles, scream and shout.","Nobody can be perfect unless he admits his faults, but if he has faults how can he be perfect?","Committees have become so important nowadays that subcommittees have to be appointed to do the work.","Originality is the fine art of remembering what you hear but forgetting where you heard it.","A pessimist is a man who looks both ways when he crosses the street.","Heredity is what sets the parents of a teenager wondering about each other.","A censor is an expert in cutting remarks. A censor is a man who knows more than he thinks you ought to.","As a matter of fact is an expression that precedes many an expression that isn't.","Television has changed the American child from an irresistable force to an immovable object.","Some problems are so complex that you have to be highly intelligent and well informed just to be undecided about them.","Work is accomplished by those employees who have not yet reached their level of incompetence.","Slump, and the world slumps with you. Push, and you push alone.","America is a country that doesn't know where it is going but is determined to set a speed record getting there.","There are two kinds of egotists: Those who admit it, and the rest of us.","Psychiatry enables us to correct our faults by confessing our parents' shortcomings.","Education is a method whereby one acquires a higher grade of prejudices.","Democracy is a process by which people are free to choose the man who will get the blame.","Everyone rises to their level of incompetence.","Equal opportunity means everyone will have a fair chance at being incompetent.","The great question is not whether you have failed, but whether you are content with failure.","Make three correct guesses consecutively and you will establish a reputation as an expert.","Men now monopolize the upper levels... depriving women of their rightful share of opportunities for incompetence.","The man who says he is willing to meet you halfway is usually a poor judge of distance.","A man convinced against his will is not convinced.","Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell, and advertise.","An intelligence test sometimes shows a man how smart he would have been not to have taken it."],"Laurence Olivier":["I don't know what is better than the work that is given to the actor - to teach the human heart the knowledge of itself.","We have all, at one time or another, been performers, and many of us still are - politicians, playboys, cardinals and kings.","Living is strife and torment, disappointment and love and sacrifice, golden sunsets and black storms. I said that some time ago, and today I do not think I would add one word.","Have a very good reason for everything you do.","The actor should be able to create the universe in the palm of his hand.","We ape, we mimic, we mock. We act.","I believe that in a great city, or even in a small city or a village, a great theater is the outward and visible sign of an inward and probable culture.","I take a simple view of life: keep your eyes open and get on with it.","Nine books have been written about me, and there's not a word of truth in any of them.","A man's prime interest in life must be his work.","I'd like people to remember me for a diligent expert workman. I think a poet is a workman. I think Shakespeare was a workman. And God's a workman. I don't think there's anything better than a workman.","Surely we have always acted; it is an instinct inherent in all of us. Some of us are better at it than others, but we all do it.","Acting is a masochistic form of exhibitionism. It is not quite the occupation of an adult.","'Richard III' is a really difficult play to film - it's involved, often obscure. I felt it absolutely necessary to do more simplification than I've ever done before.","The office of drama is to exercise, possibly to exhaust, human emotions. The purpose of comedy is to tickle those emotions into an expression of light relief; of tragedy, to wound them and bring the relief of tears. Disgust and terror are the other points of the compass.","When you're a young man, Macbeth is a character part. When you're older, it's a straight part.","I often think that could we creep behind the actor's eyes, we would find an attic of forgotten toys and a copy of the Domesday Book.","Lead the audience by the nose to the thought.","My stage successes have provided me with the greatest moments outside myself, my film successes the best moments, professionally, within myself.","If he was lost for a moment, he would dive straight back into its honey.","I should be soaring away with my head tilted slightly toward the gods, feeding on the caviar of Shakespeare. An actor must act.","Nobody is going to pretend that I am younger than I am. Apart from anything else, it is in the papers all the damn time - every time I have a birthday.","I can't think I've ever loved anybody quite as much... My mother was my life, really; she was my entire world.","It took me two years to walk around a chair with ease; it took me another two years to learn how to laugh onstage - and I had to learn everything.","I suppose, unconsciously, I used all my wives to further my journey up the ladder."],"Laurence Sterne":["Respect for ourselves guides our morals, respect for others guides our manners.","In solitude the mind gains strength and learns to lean upon itself.","Pain and pleasure, like light and darkness, succeed each other.","Only the brave know how to forgive... a coward never forgave; it is not in his nature.","Courtship consists in a number of quiet attentions, not so pointed as to alarm, nor so vague as not to be understood.","The desire of knowledge, like the thirst of riches, increases ever with the acquisition of it.","Men tire themselves in pursuit of rest.","I take a simple view of life. It is keep your eyes open and get on with it.","An English man does not travel to see English men.","Of all the cants which are canted in this canting world, - though the cant of hypocrites may be the worst, - the cant of criticism is the most tormenting!","Lessons of wisdom have the most power over us when they capture the heart through the groundwork of a story, which engages the passions.","God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb.","I am persuaded that every time a man smiles - but much more so when he laughs - it adds something to this fragment of life.","The most accomplished way of using books is to serve them as some people do lords; learn their titles and then brag of their acquaintance.","People who are always taking care of their health are like misers, who are hoarding a treasure which they have never spirit enough to enjoy.","A dwarf who brings a standard along with him to measure his own size, take my word, is a dwarf in more articles than one.","When the heart flies out before the understanding, it saves the judgment a world of pains.","'Tis known by the name of perseverance in a good cause, and of obstinacy in a bad one.","Only the brave know how to forgive; it is the most refined and generous pitch of virtue human nature can arrive at.","One may as well be asleep as to read for anything but to improve his mind and morals, and regulate his conduct.","Nothing is so perfectly amusing as a total change of ideas.","I wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about when they begot me.","Our passion and principals are constantly in a frenzy, but begin to shift and waver, as we return to reason.","For every ten jokes you acquire a hundred enemies.","An actor should be able to create the universe in the palm of his hand.","People who overly take care of their health are like misers. They hoard up a treasure which they never enjoy.","Writing, when properly managed, (as you may be sure I think mine is) is but a different name for conversation.","Titles of honor are like the impressions on coins, which add no value to gold or silver, but only render brass current.","When a man is discontented with himself, it has one advantage - that it puts him into an excellent frame of mind for making a bargain.","But this is neither here nor there why do I mention it? Ask my pen, it governs me, I govern not it.","Sciences may be learned by rote, but wisdom not.","Keyholes are the occasions of more sin and wickedness, than all other holes in this world put together.","There have been no sects in the Christian world, however absurd, which have not endeavoured to support their opinions by arguments drawn from Scripture.","Of all duties, prayer certainly is the sweetest and most easy.","So much of motion, is so much of life, and so much of joy, and to stand still, or get on but slowly, is death and the devil.","Alas! if the principles of contentment are not within us, the height of station and worldly grandeur will as soon add a cubit to a man's stature as to his happiness.","Religion which lays so many restraints upon us, is a troublesome companion to those who will lay no restraints upon themselves.","It is a great pity but tis certain from every day's observation of man, that he may be set on fire like a candle, at either end provided there is a sufficient wick standing out.","I once asked a hermit in Italy how he could venture to live alone, in a single cottage, on the top of a mountain, a mile from any habitation? He replied, that Providence was his next-door neighbor.","In all unmerciful actions, the worst of men pay this compliment at least to humanity, as to endeavour to wear as much of the appearance of it, as the case will well let them.","What is the life of man! Is it not to shift from side to side? From sorrow to sorrow? To button up one cause of vexation! And unbutton another!"],"Laurence Tribe":["Nothing in the 14th Amendment or in any other constitutional provision suggests that the president may usurp legislative power to prevent a violation of the Constitution.","I do not have, nor do I believe I have seen, a vision capacious and convincing enough to propound as an organizing principle for the next phase in the law of our Constitution.","The Second Amendment does protect the right to people to possess weapons for self-defense in the home. That's what the Supreme Court said.","We need to do something about the culture of violence.","The Constitution grants only Congress - not the president - the power 'to borrow money on the credit of the United States.'","There are a lot of things that fit on a bumper sticker in terms of either liberty or equality or progress that when made more concrete just don't pan out."],"Laurence Yep":["I get the ideas from everything. Children sometimes think you have to have special experiences to write, but good writing brings out what's special in ordinary things.","Most of the fiction on the California Gold Rush makes it sound like one grand, boyish adventure. However, when you read the real history, you realize that it wasn't that way at all.","My mother was actually born in Ohio but raised in West Virginia where her family had a laundry. She has a West Virginian accent. My father was born in China, but he's the son of an American citizen. My paternal grandfather was born in San Francisco in 1867.","I like all kinds of stories, and I usually work on several stories at once. When I run out of gas on one, I start work on the other.","I was surprised at how cosmopolitan the Gold Rush was: prospectors were of all races, genders, and countries. I was equally surprised at how fast gold prospecting became big business.","The ku-magic is a very ancient magic. It predates Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism.","I was born in San Francisco's Chinatown in 1948 but grew up in a black neighborhood. During elementary and middle school, I commuted to a bilingual school in Chinatown. So I did not confront white American culture until high school.","While I was in high school, I discovered and began writing science fiction.","At 18, my first short story was published - I was paid a penny a word by a science fiction magazine. I continued to write, and five years later I published my first novel, 'Sweetwater.'","In 1966, I attended Marquette University and graduated from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1970. I received my doctorate in English from the State University of New York at Buffalo, where I wrote my dissertation on William Faulkner's early novels.","I started writing at the age of seventeen because I had a teacher in high school who said that we had to get something accepted by a national magazine to get an A. The teacher later withdrew that threat, but the writing bug bit me.","My ancestors come from a part of southern China where most villages can trace their roots back at least a thousand years or even more. However, as a typical American, I have lived in four cities and moved at least seven times.","As a child growing up in San Francisco in the 1950s, I sometimes met insults when I ventured outside of Chinatown or my neighborhood. I have even been spat on and threatened with a knife. I could have let my anger fester until it became hate. However, I realized they were isolated incidents, and I simply got on with my life.","My grandmother, my mother and my aunts and their friends were all of southern Chinese ancestry, and they were all strong figures. Though if you asked them who was the head of their families, they would have said their husbands; and yet it was the women who ran everything.","When something horrible is done to you, the natural impulse is to strike back.","The southern Chinese are a mixture of the Han, or northern Chinese, and the local tribes, some of which allowed women a great deal of freedom - much to the horror of the Chinese who were good Confucians. As a result, the folklore from southern China has strong females; and I found that the folktales mirrored my own experience."],"Laurene Powell Jobs":["It's not that our high school system was not designed well, but that it was designed in 1906 when the country was just out of the industrial era. There hasn't been a substantial systemic change the way we do high school since then.","To do what you wanna do, to leave a mark - in a way that you think is important and lasting - that's a life well-lived.","The beauty of having an LLC in today's world is No. 1, you have the ability to act and react as nimbly as need be to create change, and you have the ability to invest politically, in the for-profit sector and the nonprofit sector simultaneously.","The way that we are going to solve social problems is by working with multiple different types of investing.","The innovation and creativity that's so manifest in the rest of society needs to be turned on our school systems.","Teachers have told us across the country that what's severely outdated is the teacher at the front of the classroom as the font of knowledge, because as we know, access to knowledge and information is now ubiquitous. So instead, teachers want to help students learn how to think so that they can be lifelong learners.","How about we agree upon what our common American values are, which is let's make this a true land of opportunity.","My relationship with money is that it's a tool to be self-sufficient, but it's not something that is a part of who I am.","Regardless of zip code, talent and IQ are evenly distributed, so we need to make sure that opportunity is evenly distributed, too.","I started getting more and more active around immigration reform because this was such a waste of lives, such a waste of potential, such a waste for our country not to have the human capital that we developed - geared toward improving our entire society.","I came across this circumstance of undocumented students. These are kids who were brought to this country as youngsters, who are raised as Americans and go to American schools, and then when they graduate high school, they have no prospects in front of them because they are undocumented and illegally in the United States.","That's why our country is such a beautiful, beautiful experiment: We manifest, we allow freedom if you follow certain rules and if you work really hard. That's at the root of our cherished values.","Whether someone signs something is not what's important. It's what they do and how they do it that matters.","There is a huge gap between what students want for their future and what their schools are offering.","It's our privilege to work with College Track students as they chart their course toward a college degree - they bring persistence, creativity, and extraordinary discipline throughout their academic journey.","Broken institutions are an opportunity rather than a time to go home.","I've always had this idea that you have to make the most of things.","It's hard when people die, but there's something about when people die suddenly.","I have more time to work; I just do. Because once your kids are up and running, that frees you up a good 20, 30, hours a week.","As a parent, you have to be good coach and bad coach, and I think in the college-application process, I didn't want to be bad coach. 'This is amazing! I'm so proud of you!' That's the role I wanted with my kids.","I much prefer STEAM to STEM. The insertion of the A is arts writ large, and when you learn how to think, that means that you actually need to understand how others have thought before you, how have others made sense of the world."],"Laurent Baheux":["We need to recover our true nature by relocating ourselves on this planet, being respectful of our environment, and living in harmony with other species - like a big family.","The rules of wildlife are simple and clear, which is not the case for men.","There are mountains, plains, deserts with panoramas that take your breath away.","I started photographing amazing African wildlife for my own pleasure. It was like a much-needed antidote to my life in the city, which I was fast becoming allergic to.","Since I was a kid, I inherited my dad's love for animals and wildlife, even for the ones we had around the house in the French countryside, a 'smaller' kind of nature. Then, as I grew up, I looked more deeply into the African continent and its wildlife.","I first worked on sports photography, and it was until 2002, when I was already 32 years old, that I really started working and enjoying Africa's wildlife.","My first exhibition oriented towards raising awareness was in 2008 in Paris. That was the first time I felt like I actually did something related to wildlife protection, and ever since that time, I haven't stopped.","Noise does not disturb me, as I think that it gives a quaint atmosphere to a picture that fully matches my vision of nature and the wild species I like to photograph.","Many photographers get involved with the people whom they take pictures of; others prefer being observers, keeping a certain distance.","For me, Africa is a land of light and contrast. Black and white is the best way to express the solitary emotion and vitality of wildlife.","Sometimes, I am lucky because all factors are combined - composition, light, emotion - and sometimes not. Most of the time, I must be patient and wait.","All I want to do is to present the abundance of life on Earth.","I don't do a lot of editing post-shoot, but I use Lightroom to play with contrast and texture and to remove dust."],"Laurent Brancowitz":["It's a complicated relationship with a guitar. I love the Bullet, for sure.","I am the extreme member of the band because I never go out after the show. It's my rule.","To me, the idea of living this lifestyle is so boring that I would prefer to read Marcel Proust the whole time during a tour.","I always considered technical musicianship as something you should be ashamed of - I don't know why.","It's a great honor when somebody takes your song and does something different with it. That's what music is all about: to constantly change what somebody else has done.","My heroes, I couldn't imagine them practicing. Like Bob Dylan, you know? Bob Dylan's a very, very good guitar player, but it's like he's trying to hide it. I always loved this attitude. When you're very good... it's like being an athlete - and I always hated sports!","I thought it was too 'glam rock' to practice. The problem is that now I'm a pretty bad guitar player.","The bands you like and know that are French are always outsiders in the French music industry - Daft Punk, Air.","When people say 'stadium songs,' it's really negative. All the festival headliners, I've realised, are usually the worst bands."],"Laurent Fabius":["The demographic weight of countries such as China and India exercise a massive pressure on our wages and salaries. They have accomplished massive technological advances and the revolution in information technology has reduced the costs of transport.","The single currency should allow the European Union, and therefore France, to balance its monetary strength with the United States. It should help us adjust to the development of China.","But Maastricht was not the end of history. It was a first step towards a Europe of growth, of employment, a social Europe. That was the vision of Francois Mitterrand. We are far from that now.","There are 20 million unemployed and what does the Constitution offer us in the Europe of 25, 27 and soon to be 30: policies of unrestricted competition to the detriment of production, wages, research and innovation.","I am a partisan and artisan of Europe. But I draw the lessons of my experience in government.","We on the left who are pro-European and Internationalist wish to unite the peoples under a social model.","France on its own cannot impose its point of view. But neither should it give up on its demands. With a clear vote for change France will be in a strong position.","This revision of the Constitution will not be perfect. But at least the Constitution will not be inflexible. It will be a step towards the Social Europe which we wish.","This assumes an upward revision of the European Budget, which is precisely what Jacques Chirac refuses to do. On the contrary, he has demanded a reduction.","For a long time many believed that there would be an automatic adjustment and counted on a rapid increase in the wages of the emerging nations, on our advances in technology and the costs of transport preventing disruption. But this reassuring analysis is out of date.","At the same time the Constitution sets in stone the Stability Pact and risks preventing member States from implementing a policy of growth. So we are not able to do things at the European or the national level.","Shopkeepers are not bankers.","I want to make an extremely strong appeal to those who abstained. Vote. It takes five minutes and then it's for five years.","The U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto protocol endangers the entire process."],"Laurent Jalabert":["It's true that this year, following my accident in the pre-season, I kind of lost morale and I felt like quitting at the end of this year. But today I can say that I want to be a professional bike rider in the year 2003 as well.","We certainly will prepare consciously and professionally, but still you cannot predict the future.","Of course, if this season turns out to be terrible for me - if I get injured again and this prevents me from reaching a satisfying level, then I could change my decision again. But at this moment, it absolutely feels like the right thing for me to continue through 2003.","I'm very aware that to reach the same level and have the same amount of success will be extremely difficult.","I never thought we'd catch him, and when I saw he was ready to drop I felt sorry for him. I wanted to show it's not true I'm trying to win it all. My goal is the Tour of Spain.","Especially with the signing of riders with climbing abilities and the new arrival of Tyler Hamilton, who has the strength and ability to become a great leader for the big tours. All in all, I feel this is a very complete team.","Also, for a team as strong as like ours, the Tour will always remain the biggest goal of the whole year, and personally I will certainly concentrate most of my energy on this race."],"Laurent Lamothe":["Countries should think of Haiti not as a place where to do charity but a place where to invest and do business. And doing business in Haiti means poverty reduction.","Haitian diplomacy will be oriented toward the influx of foreign capital, direct investments that create jobs and stimulate economic growth.","The diiference is that in the private sector you work for yourself, and as Prime Minister I work for every single Haitian - inside Haiti and outside - and for all those who love Haiti as well.","I want to see Haiti do better. We have the sun everywhere: that's a big asset. We have wonderful coasts, beautiful islands, mountains. Other countries that have that are known for it, but Haiti has been so focused inwards, on its problems.","I wanted to contribute my time, myself, my knowledge, my love, because Haiti is my everything.","Canadians have been very generous toward Haiti after the earthquake and, thanks to you, our most vulnerable people have received food, drinkable water, shelter, medical care and education. For that, we are extremely grateful.","Haiti is 10.4-million people, of whom 35 per cent are children under 15. The country has always had great potential - and this is still the case. Our ill fortune has long been a matter of bad governance. And now things have changed.","Dear friends of Haiti, we are indeed on the right track. Slowly but surely we are rising from the ashes.","We must consider bringing forward legislation that will facilitate the creation and implementation of businesses in Haiti. Overall, we must better position the country to compete for new market opportunities.","As Minister of Foreign Affairs. I will work on deepening Haiti's links with its traditional partners from the North and the South, while exploring all the opportunities for economic, cultural, scientific and technological cooperation that may benefit my country.","Haiti is open for business!"],"Laurette Taylor":["Acting is the physical representation of a mental picture and the projection of an emotional concept.","Personality is more important than beauty, but imagination is more important than both of them."],"Laurie Anderson":["Paradise is exactly like where you are right now... only much, much better.","The world is a strange and wonderful place.","At the School of Visual Arts in New York, you can get your degree in Net art, which is really a fantastic way of thinking of theater in new ways.","I've never really had a hobby, unless you count art, which the IRS once told me I had to declare as a hobby since I hadn't made money with it.","Performance art is about joy, about making something that's so full of kind of a wild joy that you really can't put into words.","It's good to take a longer view and think, What would I really like to do if I had no limitations whatsoever?","The problem with prototypes is they don't always work.","When love is gone, there's always justice. And when justice is gone, there's always force. And when force is gone, there's always Mom. Hi, Mom!","I'm a real workaholic.","I so much appreciate it when anybody tries to make something and tries to be an artist - I'm happy to see the work.","I see and write things first as an artist, second as a woman, and third as a New Yorker. All three have built-in perspectives that aren't neutral.","I really like books that you can kind of hear as much as think about, that are so graphic and visual.","A lot of the work in United States is highly critical of technology. I'm using 15,000 watts of power and 18 different pieces of electronic equipment to say that.","The only stuff I don't like are Broadway musicals. I hate them. I don't even like to talk about it. I can't bear musicals.","It's just such a great miracle when things do work, and they work for such a wild variety of crazy reasons.","I have written a lot about snakes. There's something pretty primordial about it.","I hate zoos.","You can do great things with low-tech stuff.","You can do bigger and bigger things. For what?","Writers want to summarize: What does this mean? What did we learn from this? That's a very 19th-century way of thinking about art, because it assumes that it should make our lives better or teach us something.","Why do you have to translate and decode things? Just let the image be. It will have a special kind of reality that it won't once it's decoded.","The thing that's characteristic of my performance is that I literally do drag the whole studio onto the stage.","The fewer expectations you have, the better.","Something that has so much power must have life. Instruments have life.","People only stutter at the beginning of the word. They're not afraid when they get to the end of the word. There's just regret.","People are really suffering these days. There's a lot of corporate triumph and a lot of personal despair as they wonder what are they working for.","One of the things I learned from working on the Olympics was, the world does not need another big multimedia show.","My work is more about trying to ask good questions and not trying to come up with big shows. Every fashion company is doing that, every car company is doing that.","My secret dream is to write an epic poem. That's probably the most pretentious thing I've said.","My job is to make images and leave the decision-making and conclusion-drawing to other people.","If there are bases on the moon, that would be the end of the moon as we know it.","I think women are excellent social critics.","I think artists who are attracted to working on the Net will adjust their work to the capabilities of a very small screen.","I think a lot of people in Washington are extremely suspicious of NASA.","I just sort of wish people would dance differently. It reminds me of teenage sex.","I have written a few children's books. The first book that I wrote was for children. It was called 'The Package', and it was a mystery story in pictures. It had no words.","I don't take compliments so well. I always hang my head and shuffle and kind of try to immediately forget.","I've been trying to avoid goal-oriented behavior.","I'm not usually where I think I am. It's kind of spooky.","I'm an average enough person to point to the things I've gotten to see that are awe-inspiring.","Besides all those whaling details, Moby Dick is about someone who's looking for something so huge, something they've wanted all their life, yet they know when they find it, it will kill them.","As an artist I'd choose the thing that's beautiful more than the one that's true.","As a New Yorker, I'm someone who lives on an island and looks across to America.","A lot of words in English confuse the idea of life and electricity, like the word livewire.","A lot of artists who have a certain style are expected to more or less keep doing their style. It's so easy to get into that rut of production."],"Laurie Colwin":["The table is a meeting place, a gathering ground, the source of sustenance and nourishment, festivity, safety, and satisfaction. A person cooking is a person giving: Even the simplest food is a gift.","We know that without food we would die. Without fellowship, life is not worth living.","We need time to defuse, to contemplate. Just as in sleep our brains relax and give us dreams, so at some time in the day we need to disconnect, reconnect, and look around us.","No one who cooks, cooks alone. Even at her most solitary, a cook in the kitchen is surrounded by generations of cooks past, the advice and menus of cooks present, and the wisdom of cookbook writers.","One of the delights of life is eating with friends; second to that is talking about eating. And, for an unsurpassed double whammy, there is talking about eating while you are eating with friends.","The sharing of food is the basis of social life.","Provision as much pure and organic food as you can, and let the rest go by.","Cooking is like love. You don't have to be particularly beautiful or very glamorous, or even very exciting to fall in love. You just have to be interested in it. It's the same thing with food.","I myself am not particularly interested in restaurant cooking. I don't really want to learn how to make a napoleon. I'd much rather learn how to make a very good lemon cake, which you can make in your own home. I like plain, old-fashioned home food.","The fact is that modern life has deprived us of life's one great luxury: time.","I come from a coffee-loving family, and you can always tell when my sister and I have been around, because both of us collect all the dead coffee from everyone's morning cup, pour it over ice, and drink it. This is a disgusting habit.","My idea of a good time abroad is to visit someone's house and hang out, poking into their cupboards if they will let me.","It is not just the Great Works of mankind that make a culture. It is the daily things, like what people eat and how they serve it.","Cooking is like anything else: some people have an inborn talent for it. Some become expert by practicing, and some learn from books.","The best way to feel at ease in the kitchen is to learn at someone's knee.","Not everyone can write a book or paint a picture or write a symphony, but almost anyone can fall in love. There is something almost miraculous in that.","I love to eat out, but even more, I love to eat in.","Certainly, cooking for oneself reveals man at his weirdest.","When it comes to cakes and puddings, savouries, bread and tea cakes, the English cannot be surpassed.","Somehow or other, I always end up in a kitchen feeding a crowd.","Unlike some people who love to go out, I love to stay home.","As everyone knows, there is only one way to fry chicken correctly. Unfortunately, most people think their method is best, but most people are wrong. Mine is the only right way, and on this subject I feel almost evangelical.","I am not a fancy cook or an ambitious cook. I am a plain old cook.","There is nothing like roast chicken. It is helpful and agreeable, the perfect dish no matter what the circumstances. Elegant or homey, a dish for a dinner party or a family supper, it will not let you down.","The thing about homebodies is that they can usually be found at home. I usually am, and I like to feed people.","It is my opinion that Norman Rockwell and his ilk have done more to make already anxious people feel guilty than anyone else.","When I was alone, I lived on eggplant, the stove top cook's strongest ally. I fried it and stewed it, and ate it crisp and sludgy, hot and cold. It was cheap and filling and was delicious in all manner of strange combinations. If any was left over, I ate it cold the next day on bread."],"Laurie Garrett":["At no time in history have we succeeded in making, in a timely fashion, a specific vaccine for more than 260 million people.","There is no governing structure for a pandemic, and little more than vague political pressure to ensure limited access to life-sparing tools and medicines for more than half the world population.","Without equity, pandemic battles will fail. Viruses will simply recirculate, and perhaps undergo mutations or changes that render vaccines useless, passing through the unprotected populations of the planet.","'Contagion' should serve as a wake-up call not only about the germs, but perhaps more importantly about the frailty of governance, nationally and worldwide.","Most Americans think that public health is services for poor people, and since most Americans hate poor people and want all poor people's services destroyed, they hate public health.","What public health really is is a trust. That's why I used the term 'Betrayal of Trust' as the title of my book. It's a trust between the government and the people."],"Laurie Graham":["Times may have changed, but there are some things that are always with us - loneliness is one of them.","None of us wants to be reminded that dementia is random, relentless, and frighteningly common.","As one ages, eventually, no matter what regime you've followed, no matter how fiercely you've fought the fight, good health becomes harder to maintain. It may disappear overnight or simply dwindle, but with every year that passes, the odds shorten.","I've been lucky enough to travel widely. When you're based in Europe, it's very easy to go to Madrid or Budapest for the weekend. I also lived in Italy for ten years and now live in Ireland.","Sorry, I don't do castles. I hate those winding turret stairs.","I almost always use first person voice in my novels. It has its limitations, but it gives a sense of immediacy that's hard to create with an anonymous, all-seeing narrator.","I've never minded solitude. For a writer, it's a natural condition. But caring for a dementia sufferer leads to a peculiar kind of loneliness.","Sundown is often the worst time of day for people with dementia. They can become restless and difficult.","The terror dementia sufferers must feel is unimaginable, but the techniques they use to hide their difficulties - the ducking and diving and keeping the world laughing - are perfectly understandable.","I have but one rule at my table. You may leave your cabbage, but you'll sit still and behave until I've eaten mine.","In the Seventies, my children played in the street, read politically incorrect stories, ate home-cooked food and occasional junk and, yes, were sometimes smacked.","With Alzheimer's, recent memory is affected first. At the start, you count the memory loss in days, then hours - then in minutes. But there's also an insidious backward creep of deterioration.","Dementia is quite unlike cancer or heart disease or any of those other conditions where you bargain with God for a cure or even just a bit more time.","Characters develop as the book progresses, but any that start to bore me end up in the wastepaper basket. In real life, we may have to put up with tedious people, but not in novels.","As well as writing novels and doing short-order journalism, I am also the full-time carer of my husband, who has Alzheimer's. Each day feels like a race that must be run.","The wheels of publishing never slow down.","Not so very long ago, certainly well into the Thirties, a lady companion was a normal feature of life for widows or lone spinsters.","The word 'carer' makes me think of someone with a nylon overall and a long list of 'clients' to wash before she finishes her shift. A companion was something unique. A kind of live-in friend.","My research process doesn't vary much. I do a little reading to establish a timeline and decide how I'm going to approach the story.","I have a magpie mind, by which I mean I see and hear little things - photos, fragments of conversation - and store them away for future use.","My preferred style is to write in first person, so I always have to play around with possible narrator voices until I find something that works.","My early novels were very understated and English. Fourteen years ago, I met and married my American husband, and as I learned more about his background and culture, I became interested in using American voices.","I love working fictional characters into a piece of history. It plays to my strengths, which are characterization and dialogue, and assists me in my admitted weakness, plot.","Personally, my interest in social history ends around 1959, by which time I was an adolescent. I've always attributed this to my particular sensibilities. I like formality and elegance, and I'm fundamentally conservative.","I'm married to an American, and although we live in Europe, I think of myself as an honorary American.","I speak pretty fluent American, though I do so with a strong British accent, and I love America: The scale and the variety of it are astonishing to someone not born there, and I'm convinced that its energy and generosity have somehow rubbed off on me and affected my writing. For the better.","Even professional, paid carers aren't always models of saintly behaviour - and they know they can knock off at the end of their shift to go home, take an uninterrupted shower, and have a normal conversation with someone.","I hate to think I ever make my husband frightened or unhappy, but I suspect I do.","My parents never told me I was beautiful, and for one very good reason. I wasn't. When your child is a tubby, bespectacled little oddity, as I was, it's important not to give them false expectations.","The thing about praising beauty is that good looks are an unforgiving task- master, a Forth Bridge of a maintenance job. The passing years present their accounts. Younger models become available.","I'm thankful my parents obliged me to live with the unvarnished truth: I might not have been a looker, but I was a better speller than the prettiest girl in my class, and I was funnier, too.","Childhood doesn't have to be perfect, and children don't have to be beautiful. From a bit of grit may grow a pearl, and if pearl production doesn't materialise, the outcome will still be preferable to the shallowness of vanity.","In grief, after even the happiest of relationships, we go over things again and again.","I think my mother was baffled by me. We were polar opposites. She was shy and retiring. I was over-fond of the limelight. Many times in my life, I was conscious of embarrassing her with my carrying on.","My mother was a fastidious and orderly homemaker. I was the messy but creative type. I picture her following behind me through life with a damp rag and an air of exasperation.","I know my parents loved me - they certainly did everything they could for me - but displays of affection were kept on a distinctly low flame.","Far more than dreading ending up in a care home myself, I dread having to put my husband in one.","Caring burns a lot of fuel - psychological and physical, too, if any lifting is involved. The energy tank is soon emptied, and the toll caring takes is well documented. It's called carer burn-out.","Once, every woman owned a small mirrored compact, and it was considered normal - sophisticated even - to flip it open to discreetly check for things like nose-glow or lipstick smudge.","People invade your space and offend your sensibilities because, to be plain, they couldn't care less about you.","It was the Victorians who covered the piano legs and drew a heavy curtain over what a lady got up to in her boudoir.","I've always jealously guarded my feminine mystique. I've been married twice, and neither of my husbands has ever seen me put my face on.","My husband is leaving me. No dramas, no slammed doors - well, OK, a few slammed doors - and no suitcase in the hall, but there is another woman involved. Her name is Dementia.","When my children were young, one of the treats promised by their grandparents was a ride in Grandad's car.","I'd like to see my grandchildren climb trees, not stand under them. I'd like to see them learn to make bread and brown it over a fire using my toasting fork.","Being eye candy always was a short-term career, and here's the reason. The world finds young women more attractive than old women because youthfulness signals fertility.","I'm married to an American, so I guess that has changed my perspective on the subjects I can write about.","I was fascinated by the culture clash between England and America in the 1950s. My first memories are of being a girl in those post-war years when things were really pretty grim. It wasn't like that in America, which was real boom time.","I have an idea for a story, and if the idea is going to work, then one of the characters steps forward, and I hear her voice telling the story. This is what has happened with all the books I've written in the first person.","There is something very easy about women's friendships that you don't see as often with men. We all know examples of this, when women will just call each other up or drop a line, not with anything specific to say.","My go-to author for knowing it all is Evelyn Waugh. 'A Handful of Dust' is as perfect as a book can get.","My husband is stricken with dementia, and it's a trick of his condition that events and people from his past are more real to him than what happened five minutes ago."],"Laurie Halse Anderson":["We have to acknowledge that adolescence is that time of transition where we begin to introduce to children that life isn't pretty, that there are difficult things, there are hard situations, it's not fair. Bad things happen to good people.","It's bad timing, but a lot of kids become teenagers just as their parents are hitting their mid-life crisis. So everybody's miserable and confused and seeking that new sense of identity.","We've fallen down on our responsibility to our children by somehow creating this world where they're surrounded by images of sexuality; and yet, we as adults struggle to talk to kids honestly about sex, the rules of dignity and consent.","Sometimes things just fall out of your head on the paper, and if you're smart, you learn not to touch them.","I wish America would stop judging and criticizing teens and instead, try to understand the battles they have to fight every day.","This is my one beef with Hollywood: It's great for movie sales, but they've created this fiction for us that, when you have a hard thing in your life, it's going to get fixed, and then your life will be awesome! Forever!","We're good at taking care of little kids, and spend a lot of energy teaching them things like how to read. But when kids get as tall as their parents and can look them in the eyes, we tend to drop the ball - at a time they most need a loving consistent community of adults, be it parents, aunts, uncles, or others.","I've dealt with depression my entire life, on and off, which makes me the perfect author for teenage readers.","I reach for funny books all the time to help me get through life.","Kids are mostly very resilient.","Some adults would rather pretend that bad things don't exist than to talk about them.","Each reader has to find her or his own message within a book.","I don't reread my books after they're published, because it's agony.","I think maybe I might have to do what some other authors do, which is do a variation on my name, just to send readers the message that, 'Yep, this is me, but this is a different part of me. So brace yourself.'","Sometimes when I find myself very irritated about a topic, I know it's my next book.","I think how veterans are treated in our country is an abomination. We don't have the draft any more, which is why so many soldiers come from working-class - rather than middle- or high-income families. Those wealthier families aren't affected, so they're not agitating for change.","I am super proud of being an American, but we fail our veterans every day.","That can be the most painstaking aspect of being a teen, figuring out what the world really looks like. If you find someone in a book, you know you're not alone and that's what's so comforting about books.","The feedback I get is that my books are honest. I don't sugar-coat anything. Life is really hard.","I'm finally watching 'Mad Men.' As a child of the '60s, I can't believe how old everything looks! I am the age of baby Eugene.","You know how sometimes you hear a chord played on an organ and you can feel it vibrating in your bones? Sometimes when I'm writing, I can feel my bones vibrating because I'll have a thought or I'll have a character's voice in my head, and that's when I know I'm on the right track.","If I can write a book that will help the world make a little more sense to a teen, then that's why I was put on the planet.","I'm a big 'Star Trek' fan.","I've written in every imaginable location; a repurposed closet, the kitchen table, the bleachers while my kids had basketball practice, the front seat of the car when they were at soccer. In airports. On trains. In the break room when I was supposed to be wolfing down dinner. In the back of classrooms when I was supposed to be paying attention."],"Laurie Helgoe":["One of the best places for a shy person to meet people is in a coffee shop. If you are a reader, bring a book and read it there - that gives a guy something to ask you about. Same goes for sketching, writing, or any hobby you can take with you.","When someone speaks to an introvert, her brain responds with a high level of activity. It is as if several lights start flashing on a control panel.","America is a noisy culture, unlike, say, Finland, which values silence. Individualism, dominant in the U.S. and Germany, promotes the direct, fast-paced style of communication associated with extraversion. Collectivistic societies, such as those in East Asia, value privacy and restraint, qualities more characteristic of introverts.","Introverts are more effective leaders of proactive employees. When you have a creative, energetic work force, an introvert is going to draw out that energy better.","When an introvert is quiet, don't assume he is depressed, snobbish or socially deficient.","Often confused with shyness, introversion does not imply social reticence or discomfort. Rather than being averse to social engagement, introverts become overwhelmed by too much of it, which explains why the introvert is ready to leave a party after an hour and the extravert gains steam as the night goes on.","If you ask an introvert a question, wait until she thinks about it. Introverts think before speaking, not through speaking. If you want to get to the good stuff, you need to slow down.","Introverts like being introverts. We are drawn to ideas, we are passionate observers, and for us, solitude is rich and generative.","The ability to reflect is associated with critical thinking and reasoning ability. And the capacity to be alone is one of the highest levels of development. It's important to know how to self-soothe and be confident of other people's love even when they're not there in front of you.","Extraverts are comfortable thinking as they speak. Introverts prefer slow-paced interactions that allow room for thought. Brainstorming does not work for them. Email does.","Introverts prefer introversion; we tend to gain energy by reflecting and expend energy when interacting. Extroverts have the opposite preference; they tend to gain energy by interacting and expend energy while reflecting.","A shy kid might look longingly at other kids playing in the schoolyard, afraid and unsure about how to approach them, but an introvert is perfectly content on her own.","I am very troubled by the tendency to define introverts by what they lack. Introversion is a preference, not a fallback plan.","I loved the study of psychology. I didn't love seeing patient after patient. I was perpetually overstimulated, busy decoding everything I took in.","I've come to see the mosh pit as an apt description of American society - and of my childhood home. I was number nine of ten creative, mostly loud kids competing for airspace.","There's a lot to love about America - freedom, the melting pot of diversity, individualism - all attractive concepts, especially to an introvert. In fact, the introverts were probably the first to feel crowded in England and to daydream about all the space they would find in the New World. Peace! Quiet!","Introversion, when embraced, is a wellspring of riches. It took me years to acknowledge this simple reality, to claim my home, and to value all it offers.","Breaking up is the hardest thing we do. It's the most important thing we do, in a way. You've got to embrace rejection, or you'll maintain a very limited life. It'll be very nice and neat - and very, very small."],"Laurie Hernandez":["I want to make sure I always show off my smile and have a positive attitude the whole time, whether it's during a performance, practice, or doing an interview.","I want to be a role model. I want to be able to know that I inspired girls to work hard and go for their dreams and to never give up.","When I was a little kid, I looked up to other people, so I hope that I can inspire little kids.","My greatest inspiration is my coach, Maggie Haney.","I feel I could be a role model to other Hispanic gymnasts interested in the sport, but I also want them to understand the importance of being focused, determined, and not giving up, despite all the struggles.","The first meal that I learned to make was scrambled eggs.","Through my life, I do want to inspire others.","We're all different, so even though someone is getting a skill before you, it doesn't mean that you're not good enough; it just means you have to wait a little bit, and the skill will come when it comes.","My mother was in the Army Reserve for six years. She taught me the importance of following rules, finishing what I start, never giving up, leadership skills, teamwork, staying positive, motivated and how to pack the military way when I'm traveling!","I hope I can help inspire people to go for their dreams.","Of course I'm very sassy.","Growing up, there wasn't an exact Hispanic role model that I had. I didn't realize how big a difference I was making, going to the Olympics and being Hispanic, until I would be in an autograph session, and parents would come up to me and say, 'You know, our family is so proud of you, you're really doing Hispanics proud.'","The thing that makes me feel the most confident is definitely my smile. I like that my smile and my facial expressions really show what I'm feeling, and my smile is the best way to show that I'm happy.","Having the opportunity to go to the U.S. Olympics was great because I was the first Latina in over 30 years to compete in gymnastics at the Olympics.","My family has always been very close. Ever since I was a kid, everybody was always together, including my grandma. In the mornings, my mom would work, and my grandma would help me get ready and would walk me to school. We were all so close to her.","When you have family with you, it gives you extra energy.","No matter what race or color you are, you can aspire to do something great.","I don't think that being Hispanic, being black, being white - I don't think that limits you to anything. I think everyone should just go for what they want.","Now that I'm doing all these big competitions, I've learned to control my nerves and control my mindset, and I think that's where the maturity comes in.","I definitely take it as a really big responsibility on my shoulders to make sure I'm motivating my generation and the people around me and, hopefully, inspire people to try something new.","If you want to train hard enough to go to the Olympics, then you're going to go out, and you're going to do it. It doesn't matter what skin color or who you are.","The big cheat meal will be a cookies and cream milkshake.","Basically, I was a little bit nervous before competing beam at the Olympics, and I had this nervous thing to just talk to myself, like 'You can do it, you can do it.' And right before I hopped up there, I said, 'I got this.'","It's kind of like I won a gold medal with my family.","I hope the Final Five has shown that everyone is capable of success if they work hard.","I am extremely close to my grandma. Growing up, she would always do my hair; she was always the one who would make me chocolate milk or rice when I came home.","Honestly, I don't really know the rules of tango!","Everyone keeps asking me when I have time to rest. I'll tell you when: I get all my sleep on planes. If the flight is five hours, my nap is five hours! I'll sleep through the whole flight.","I like history because you can't really progress without knowing what comes before you, so I think it's super fascinating.","I love performing for the crowd. Maybe that's what it is. I'm a crowd pleaser.","When I'm not training, I'm typically doing anything self-care, so, like, bath bombs and face masks, or, like, having a movie night with my family, if that's possible.","I love my height because when I'm doing gymnastics, it really benefits the sport - and also, I think being short is kind of cute.","I started a gymnastics class at five years old, but it became serious at seven.","Don't let people tell you that you can't do something.","When you're a little girl, and you're watching the Olympics, and you see this very diverse group of gymnasts out there, and - I think this team, the Final 5, will inspire so many little girls to go out there and do what they love.","I think I still like science and art better, but geometry is a big improvement over algebra.","I got a piece of a dead person's ligament in my body.","Secretly, I'm a 5-year-old.","I've been to Tokyo-slash-Japan - we actually went to Yokohama in 2015 and 2013 for international competitions. I think that it would be really nice to go back and do a little Olympic thing there.","I'm confident. I'm a crowd pleaser.","I think people are people. If you want something, go get it. I don't think it matters what race you are.","People have seen me at my best, but I don't think most of them know everything that it took to get me to where I am today.","If you think too far ahead, then it'll just stress you out.","I think it's amazing that I can go out there and be myself, and the fact that I'm carrying Puerto Rico on my back a little bit is such an honor.","My earliest memory was watching gymnastics on live TV and wanting to do what the 'big girls' did.","I am second-generation American, and my grandparents are from Puerto Rico.","A goal of making it to the Olympic Games has motivated me to work very hard in my sport.","I would love to be an actress!","My whole life revolved around gymnastics because I loved it so much. I home-schooled because of it; I changed my eating habits.","Two people who really inspire me are my parents, Wanda and Anthony, just because they really made sure to keep up Hispanic culture in my family.","Life has been a really big whirlwind, but it's been a lot of fun. I travel so much, and I'm constantly doing things that I love, but it's just me.","As an athlete, the most important thing is the protein that you eat and the things that you put into your body. Without that, it's very hard to function throughout the day.","I listen to a lot of music. One of my favorite songs is 'Final Song' by M. It's something that I listen to before a lot of competitions.","I love listening to music in general before I compete. It's something that calms me down, and meditating and breathing before I get up there to calm all my nerves.","When I was a little kid, I don't remember looking up and seeing so many Hispanic athletes out there.","Sometimes you just don't know what to say.","People call me the human emoji because I think people recognize that if I'm ever thinking something or feeling a certain emotion, it goes straight to my face. So if I'm happy, you'll know I'm happy, and if I'm mad, you'll know I'm mad just by looking at me.","I don't see it as pressure at all. I see it as such an honor to just in some sort of way represent Puerto Rico and Hispanics and all the girls out there.","Being able to do something that I love and be at such a high level of gymnastics is just amazing.","My emotions kind of shine through my face, so whatever I'm thinking is what I'm portraying as well.","It's weird to hear anyone call me a role model.","The Olympics was really, really stressful because I had never done anything like it. At the same time, I was understanding something like that could never really happen again. I embraced it and took in everything.","I knew when I started gymnastics, I wanted to have a lot of fun and eventually go to the Olympics. On the moments where I felt really down, I just remembered, 'You're almost there. Just keep going. Keep working hard.'","Meeting kids who feel inspired by my story, it means so much to me.","My first week at 'DWTS' was amazing! I definitely fangirled when I walked into the ballroom because I looked at all the judges and where they were sitting, and I was like, 'Wow, that's the official judges' table!'","As far as cartoons go, I watched a lot of 'Ed, Edd, n Eddy' when I was a kid.","Dancing is so much fun.","Even though I'm a gymnast, I've always loved dancing.","People have always asked me why my favorite event was floor, and my answer was always, 'Because I love to dance!'","Dancing is different than gymnastics, but it's a good different, and it's something that I've always wanted to try.","It's really hard to be all serious in the tango and not break into laughter.","Coming into 'Dancing With the Stars,' I thought it would be a lot easier.","If I could go anywhere, I'd love to visit Greece someday because it looks so beautiful, and I'd also love to go to Mexico.","I think a big part of what has helped me move forward with the sport is my family. We're all so close together, and the support system has been amazing.","I'm glad to be partnered with Orgullosa because I feel that now that I'm able to win a gold medal at the Olympics, win a silver medal, I feel little girls will be able to look up to me, and Hispanics will kind of rise a little more.","Homeschooling is great because it's extremely lenient, and so if there's a day I come home from practice and mentally, I'm just exhausted, I can actually just save the test for the next day if I really have to.","Every year, my mom makes sure I have my checkups and everything, which is probably a really good idea. She's great with all that health stuff.","Being able to wear contacts, you don't have to worry about your glasses falling off or how you look during your beam routine. As soon as they're in, literally two minutes later, you forget that they're on."],"Laurie Holden":["It's a fun thing to do: Go to a shooting range with a buddy, knock off a few rounds, release stress.","It's a little daunting to know you're going to take off your clothes and 16 million people are going to see it. It's not a normal day at the office.","I don't want my tombstone to say actress. I want it to say human being.","Well, people fall in love with the wrong guy all the time, it doesn't make them bad people.","Driving through much of the southern part of the U.S. reminds me of where I grew up in Canada. The trees, homes, sense of community... I love the South.","I am a tomboy and I love being with the boys and shooting guns and stuff.","The beauty of 'The Walking Dead' and the beauty of being on a television show for a while, is that, it's your backstory, it's part of what you are, it's what you carry with you every day.","I'm not interested in playing the victim. I like stories about survivors.","I feel defensive about my character because I really love Andrea, and we share the same heart.","I love my 'Walking Dead' family. This is the best job I ever had.","I love ghost stories but I can't really watch them, especially not by myself because then I can't sleep.","I've had a quite a few nightmares about being chased by walkers.","I'm just attracted to good material and great characters and that can come in any form, whether it's television or film or a theatre piece.","I think women are amazing and women's friendships are like a sisterhood and we should see more of it in television and film.","I'm not a runner. I do not like running. I love to swim. I love to surf. I do not like to run.","It's a really dark, emotionally wrenching world that we've created on 'The Walking Dead.'","I really, really, really want to do a silly romantic comedy where I can just have a crush on the guy, trip over myself, and laugh and be goofy. I just feel like all I do is cry, sob, and fight zombies and the bad guys.","I think there's a collective consciousness around the world that there are things beyond our control that have the power to annihilate us, as a species, and it's all rather frightening.","When forced to survive in an apocalyptic world, there are some characters that embrace their higher selves with some emerging as natural born leaders, and others succumb to their more base and primal selves and basically transform into savages. It's really a fascinating character study in the exploration of the human psyche.","I've never been a fan of sociopaths who have no conscience. That scares me because they're capable of anything.","I'm a bit of a scaredy cat. Personally, I don't like to be kept up at night."],"Laurie Lee":["It was a world that I wanted to record because it was such a miracle visitation to me.","We were living in the Slad Road when my father left us. I was about three.","I wanted to communicate what I had seen, so that others could see it.","That last winter was a tragic story and I got no personal honour out of it but I was a witness to it.","But our waking life, and our growing years, were for the most part spent in the kitchen, and until we married, or ran away, it was the common room we shared.","What she did was to open our eyes to details of country life such as teaching us names of wild flowers and getting us to draw and paint and learn poetry.","I don't know what idiocies drove me in those days, but they were naive, innocent idiocies in many ways.","I expected to be shot at any moment and if they had done I would have understood, that they couldn't take risks with someone foolhardy or so unpredictable.","I have been sitting watching that ever since I came back, the continuous variations of light and shadow."],"Laurie Metcalf":["I work just as hard and have just as much fun whether in a 50-seat house or in a 1000-seat house. It's a luxury to be in a tiny space every once in a while and a rush to be on a giant stage every once in a while.","I'm hideously shy as myself, but on stage I can run around naked and bite the heads off fish.","Onstage I'm the one in control - I'm not at the mercy of how an editor chooses to put the scene together later. I can do things onstage that I would never do in real life. It's very freeing.","Every part I get, I just think I'm so lucky. They're so hard to get, you know.","I'm happy whenever I'm in a rehearsal room. I've always gotten all my energy and creativity in there.","I've loved every minute of every hour I've spent doing theatre.","I like to play a wide range of characters. The more they're unlike me, the better I like it.","I almost never give interviews. It's not because I want to play hard to get. It's just that I never seem to have anything interesting to say.","I was an office secretary for a long time. A good secretary.","Theater opened up a whole new world for me. It was a freedom I'd never known before.","When I go to see something I'm in, or my friends are in, it's like a home movie. When I just go to the movies and don't know anyone in it, then it's a real movie.","I was horribly shy all through grade school and high school. But somehow I got up the nerve to audition for one play in high school - 'Auntie Mame.' I got a small part as the fiancee who comes on in the end. I got laughs. I wasn't shy at all doing the part. I can do anything on stage and write it off as a character.","I was too practical to major in theater. Acting - what was I going to do with acting? There was no future in it.","You know, if a TV show dropped into my lap out of the blue, I would have a hard time turning it down because there just isn't the money in theater that there is on TV.","I've been directed by other actors, and being an actor doesn't make you a good director.","One of the hardest things about directing is just to be patient and remind yourself that you've been in Week 1 of a rehearsal process yourself, and you know what it feels like.","When one thing ends, you put it away and start from scratch on the next thing.","Really, I'll go anywhere at any time to continue working in theater - it's a passion that I'm thankful I still have. It keeps me creative and on my toes and meeting great people. I can't imagine a better way of working than on a play.","I don't like working in front of a camera.","My profession is about as far away from growing up in southern Illinois as you can get.","I can't even call it work. I'm a creative-a-holic. I love the tearing into new material.","I'm not trying to blow out a camera lens or make the audience's hair go straight back from my sheer volume, sheer energy level.","No matter how many times you've done it, the early stages of getting a show up on its feet is very hit and miss. There seem to be thousands of options on every page to discover.","I don't know if ISU helped me become what I am, but I know that if I hadn't gone there, I wouldn't be what I am today.","I wasn't turning down film roles, let's put it that way. I was never really on that radar.","I gravitated back to theatre again, and when I heard about this little independent movie called 'Lady Bird,' I thought, 'This will be a project where I can dip my toe back into the water.'","I had accidentally gotten a laugh on a line in a play I was in during high school. I got hooked, but I had no idea I would ever be able to support myself by acting. I knew no one in the business. I was from the Midwest. No one within a radius of a thousand miles was doing anything like that.","A dream job is to walk right past hair and makeup.","I watch the Oscars in my pajamas like everybody else.","I was always a secretary in the early days, before we decided we were brave enough to join Equity and see if this thing has any legs.","I like contemporary, bare-boned writing. I don't like having the language that I barely understand get in the way of me interpreting it over to an audience. It's this barrier that I don't want to have to attack.","I am a kind of competitive person. I am competitive with myself. I won't let anything go until I am satisfied with how it is.","'Three Tall Women' is kind of fascinating. I had never seen it itself, and I imagine the audience will find it very intriguing to watch the reveal of who these people are and how they interact in the second act.","I don't like the camera. I get very self-conscious with it and then spend way too much time not looking self-conscious instead of being free, as I do on stage, to do my work.","That was the beauty of 'Roseanne' and Roseanne herself. It could go dark; it could do issues.","I'm incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to bring Mae to work with me as I take on the guest role of 'Mary McGowan.'","I'm so thrilled to be here on the set of 'Supergirl!'","I watch episodes of 'Rosanne' now where I don't even know what the ending's going to be.","I used to drive myself crazy by thinking, three days later, 'Ugh, why didn't I play it like that? Ugh, now that line makes sense to me.'","I like to let the work speak rather than to have to talk about it.","I want to be thinking as quickly as I need to as soon as I hit the stage. I want to have a vocal warm-up.","I tend to root for characters who have a lot of negative qualities, but what's driving them forward is their passion. They're on a mission, and maybe their approach is misguided, but you can't fault them for giving 150%.","When I get a beautifully written piece of material, I immediately start imagining how I would interpret it. I love just daydreaming about it for months, breaking it down, seeing where I can spin something. How I can turn this into the most fun ride for the audience that I can make it? That's my job."],"Laurie Notaro":["If you really believe in what you're doing, work hard, take nothing personally and if something blocks one route, find another. Never give up.","I've had to write a column an hour after I've come back from a funeral. A deadline is a deadline, I mean, that was just what my job was.","I majored in journalism at Arizona State University, where I began writing the columns I write now, but I cannot, in good conscience, refer to myself as a writer. I'm a columnist, maybe a journalist, I guess I'm an author, but writer... no. That's not up to me to call myself, that's rather lofty. It's for the reader to decide.","I've never really considered doing stand up, but I have done readings/spoken word things fairly often in which I'll just tell a bunch of stories and run off at the mouth. I'm a big tangent person.","I'm nicer on tax day than I am when I'm on deadline."],"Laurie R. King":["Whenever I go to England, I'm on pilgrimage. I walk the countryside around Eastbourne because that's where Sherlock Holmes retired.","The period after the First World War was an extremely different time, so that Sherlock Holmes would have been a different person following 1918 than he was during the Victorian era.","Blogs are the main exception I make in my aversion to complex machinery.","The last dog I had was an Irish wolfhound - now that is a dog. Rather spoils a person for a lesser canine, that is, anything under a hundredweight.","I slept in the bedroom used by Sabine Baring-Gould's wife when I was researching 'The Moor,' and later the Jamaica Inn on Bodmin Moor.","In silent films, quite complex plots are built around action, setting, and the actors' gestures and facial expressions, with a very few storyboards to nail down specific plot points.","I have been very interested in the number of kids who have read the Sherlock Holmes books after reading the Mary Russell books. That's great. That's more or less how I rediscovered the Holmes books."],"Laurie Simmons":["When I was in art school, there was a stigma attached to coming from comfortable suburbia. If you were from Great Neck, Long Island, you couldn't be a 'real artist', so I found crafty ways of implying that I was from New York.","We don't have real hours and we don't have a boss, so artists create rules for themselves that they then break. It's transgressive in such a personal way.","I'm innately conservative, and painting is an ideal place to exercise a progressive conservatism. I operate well within limits.","My favourite thing is to discover what someone does well and say, 'Do that for me.'"],"Laurieann Gibson":["She's like a Barbie, then she wants to be a superhero, or coming out of a spaceship and everything's pink. She makes a certain move that's ghetto hood mixed with a little robot so its like I'm evolving Nicki Minaj and developing her style. She's fearless, and I love her.","I think dance is amazing because what people don't realize is like when you dance your spirit and your soul get ignited. You're not only releasing endorphins, but also your spirit is awakening. It makes you feel good and happy.","A choreographer deals with the movement that you create, and with a creative director it's about the story, the stage, the lighting, the costuming, executing someone's idea, choosing how far to go or how little to go, and blending it so that you feel it, you're emotionally effected.","I enjoy getting an artist at the beginning stages, and then I'm able to pull out something that is so pure and actually create their individual style. From how they pick up the microphone, to how to look on the stage, to their dance steps, to their talk, their opinions, to what they wear, so it really gets to be developed from the beginning.","I realized that, for me, great records always moved me with the lyrics and the melodies. And so I said, 'I think I can do it now,' 'cause I found a team of people who understand I didn't want a record that was 'drop it, pop it, shake it' just 'cause I can dance.","If you love dance and you have the gift of teaching, teaching is super amazing and important because my teachers planted that seed in me. As a teacher you understand the difference or the definition of a Baryshnikov or a Gregory Hines, so teaching is really important and very necessary.","Artist development is something that I've been passionate about from my days at Uptown and Motown Records.","You are absolutely enough the way you are.","I think it's absolutely possible for any woman to use the moves I do with Lady Gaga. Just put on her 'Born This Way' video or turn on one of her songs, spend 20 minutes and get a routine down just by watching our choreography. You'll start to see a difference in your abs, legs and butt. Anyone can get great results from this.","I like to always remind my dancers about ways to avoid injury. One of the basic ways to avoid injury is to always make sure to stretch and warm up your body. This will loosen up your muscles, which will help to avoid common strain injuries such as shin splints and ankle strains.","It's all about salsa with grain chips, tofu, turkey slices, hummus, and coconut water.","The only thing that I have is the truth, so the only thing I fear is a lie.","Recently, Lady Gaga was motivated to take the helm of the creative direction of her career and as such I decided to step away. I am extremely proud of her, and in stepping away I wish her all the best.","'Born This Way' is shaping up to be creative ecstasy.","When I began to choreograph and find my way pulling other artists' dreams out and changing music in a visual way, there was still a part of me that had something more to say. There was still a desire to rock a stage and ultimately perform the eight count of my dream, but there was a lot of insecurity there.","I've created, directed and choreographed for Lady Gaga since the beginning, so 'Born This Way,' this was musically such an amazing evolution and such a brilliant record. So when she played it for me, it took me a while to find out the visual interpretation that I could give back to her.","Choreography is amazing. I'm still a dancer, yet I transitioned into choreography then as a Creative Director. All of these creative elements are brought out of being a dancer. Directing is something that comes out of understanding movement and choreography. Directing movement is directing a dance piece.","I think reality TV for dancers has changed for the better. There are more opportunities and the platforms that we are being given are better. We have more job security and TV is allowing different levels of dance to come through to the forefront. People can now take their abilities and turn them into brands and make these top dollars.","I was born in Toronto and studied with the National Ballet of Canada. I went to school to study dance, slept on the floor, ate nothing, waitressed - and then there was a Mary J. Blige audition.","I was obsessed with Chubby Checker and old dances, like the twist.","What people are feeling is the similarity in what I do and how I'm capable of breaking a new artist into a competitive field. People can't wrap their head around the fact that Gaga did not do that on her own. She didn't. There was a Laurieann Gibson.","With Lady Gaga I really stretched myself as a creative director, and because I was with this artist from before she got signed I was able to really take control of the opportunity and execute as a creative director.","People were being so mean as a result of my ability - a gift, really. So I think that's what makes me fight harder to provide an option to aspiring kids or artists. I wouldn't want anyone to go through what I went through... to see a little girl or a little dancer experience such unnecessary rejection.","Back in the early days like for the Temptations, Supremes and Four Tops, artist development was alive in record companies. Every artist had a moment to develop the record visually. When the web took over and camera phones, it stripped the artists of the power to figure it out. So there's a need to bridge that gap and that's my job.","'Saturday Night Fever,' Paula Abdul, 'Fame,' Debbie Allen... all affected me and the generation before me.","'The Dance Scene' is basically the most amazing dance show in the world, and it follows me as a creative director. You see how I maintain that creativity.","I wanted to be a star - with a purpose.","I am trained, and I did do 'The Nutcracker' in its right form, but at the time, they told me I was black and I'd never be in 'Swan Lake.' I went through all those prejudices in the ballet community, and I still emerged wonderfully trained and found my way to Alvin Ailey where there were familiar faces.","I'm born originally in Toronto, and I have what I call my 'Fame' story. I took a Greyhound bus and went to Alvin Ailey and received Dunham, Horton, Graham technique there, but I could never take my eyes off of Balanchine doing 'Nutcracker'; to me he's the best who ever did it.","Everyone has the notion that hip-hop is messy and loose, but there's also another level to it.","I love working with Alicia Keys, because it's not just the ability to do the dance to me; I think it's the ability to interpret it that excites me the most.","I dance but I also work out. I run, do strength training... you name it. I've got to!","I'm an emotional eater. If something's worth celebrating, we're going to grab pizza. If it's going bad, girl, pass me the chocolate. Gotta keep it in check!","'Boom' is my heart. The 'kack' is my soul. Apparently when I choreographed I didn't realize that I said 'boom-kack' 'boom-kack.' I had no idea I was doing it and then I realized that it's every time I felt like the fight in my soul - the boom and the kack - was like my heart. It was like the love of it - my heart and soul.","'The Dance Scene' is just a real look at what it takes. You see the award shows. You see the videos and you never realize what goes on behind the scenes. The reality and the preparation. The motivation I have to give each dancer on that set.","I think that there was a fad where everyone said, 'I want you to create a signature step for my artist.' The thing is, for me, music creates the step. The artist commands the step, you know?","I was very disenchanted in the industry for a long time before I met GaGa. Everyone wanted a 'Single Ladies' for their artist, or a Puffy move.","For me, a dancer is part of an artist's entertainment - 'backup dancer' isn't even in my vocabulary.","I want to be able to say, 'you think you're odd, I'm even odder and I made it - you can too!' I want to direct, do more with 'The Dance Scene,' sign artists and just provide opportunities. I'm just getting started and having the time of my life!","I believe it's extremely important to include some other type of fitness activity in your training, so cross training will help you to avoid injury when you are dancing.","I personally love to run outdoor fitness trails. I love the meditative value I get when out alone, challenging myself to run faster and higher."],"Lauryn Hill":["That strong mother doesn't tell her cub, Son, stay weak so the wolves can get you. She says, Toughen up, this is reality we are living in.","Be honest, brutally honest. That is what's going to maintain relationships.","We can't plan life. All we can do is be available for it.","Everything we do should be a result of our gratitude for what God has done for us.","I had to confront my fears and master my every demonic thought about inferiority, insecurity, or the fear of being black, young, and gifted in this Western culture.","I need to be surrounded by people as passionate and as dedicated as I am.","Reality is easy. It's deception that's the hard work.","The less I have, the freer I am to do whatever I want to do.","When you're young and everything dramatic is exciting, you start to believe that hype that, in order to be an artist, you have to suffer. I've graduated from that school.","What was freely given to me, I freely give.","When I have a creative insight, there is a high. I think back in the day, I made music as much as I did because it made me feel so good. I think you could argue that there is a creative addiction - but, you know, the healthy kind.","We don't want people to have expectations of us, but then we have expectations of everybody else.","Let optimists rule the world.","This life is a process of learning.","You don't know how much artists go through to make it look so easy. It's all in the practice.","We call ourselves creators and we just copy.","Nobody's going to force me to do something against my will. What do I owe anybody that I should submit my will to them?","I think what people are attracted to about me, if anything, is my passion. People got exposed to my passion through music and song first.","I tried to manipulate and control people, and I harbored resentment. I wanted to be forgiven, but I wouldn't forgive others.","I'm trying to open up my range and really sing more. With The Fugees initially, and even with 'Miseducation,' it was very hip-hop - always a singing over beats. I don't think people have really heard me sing out. So if I do record again, perhaps it will have an expanded context. Where people can hear a bit more.","Being young and female in America, you watch a lot of T.V., and you grow up on false images of what love truly is. We think the man with the best rap will protect and save us, about it's not usually that way. Then you learn love is something deeper and purer in form.","With The Fugees initially, and even with 'Miseducation', it was very hip-hop - always a singing over beats. I don't think people have really heard me sing out. So if I do record again, perhaps it will have an expanded context. Where people can hear a bit more.","People need to understand that the Lauryn Hill they were exposed to in the beginning was all that was allowed in that arena at the time. I had to step away for the sake of the machine. I was being way too compromised. I felt uncomfortable having to smile in someone's face when I really didn't like them or know them well enough to like.","I do support artists standing by their beliefs and walking with integrity. We have to find a better way to commercially exploit music while giving artists their proper respect. This cannot be done while taking their contributions for granted or trying to control the scope of their growth and power through threats and fear tactics.","I believe God will make a way.","To those supporters who were told that I abandoned them, that is untrue. I abandoned greed, corruption, and compromise, never you, and never the artistic gifts and abilities that sustained me.","I never did anything I'm really ashamed of.","I wouldn't even hold my kids sometimes because I didn't want them to spit up on me when I was dressed for an awards show.","From the first time someone says, Who do you think you are? we learn how to repress.","I don't know anybody that's not emotionally unstable or schizophrenic.","Hip-Hop isn't just music, it is also a spiritual movement of the blacks! You can't just call Hip-Hop a trend!","Over-commercialization and its resulting restrictions and limitations can be very damaging and distorting to the inherent nature of the individual. I did not deliberately abandon my fans, nor did I deliberately abandon any responsibilities.","As musicians and artists, it's important we have an environment - and I guess when I say environment, I really mean the industry, that really nurtures these gifts. Oftentimes, the machine can overlook the need to take care of the people who produce the sounds that have a lot to do with the health and well-being of society.","I don't need anybody to market or promote me. If people don't want to hear this music, then it's not for them. You cannot please everybody.","I got into direct confrontation with everybody I love.","Real religion is no religion at all.","The danger I faced was not accepted as reasonable grounds for deferring my tax payments, as authorities, who despite being told all of this, still chose to pursue action against me, as opposed to finding an alternative solution.","Since those who believe they need a hero/celebrity outnumber the actual heroes/celebrities, people feel safe and comfortably justified in numbers, committing egregious crimes in the name of the greater social ego. Ironically diminishing their own true hero-celebrity nature in the process.","When I was working, and when I was making substantial amounts of money, I always filed and paid my taxes. This only stopped, when it was necessary to withdraw from society, in order to guarantee the safety and well-being of myself and my family.","I have a couple of all-time favorites: Donny Hathaway and Roberta Flack, Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell.","We have to make sure the music and the message and the words and all the elements come through in our songs and every time we appear in public."],"Laverne Cox":["Everyone is insecure. I think, really, it comes from, like, a desire to want to be in control of how you're represented.","I just have to be myself. I'm not perfect, and I'm going to make mistakes; I might say the wrong thing. I have to be responsible to my community, and I feel like I am, but then I have to not be so hard on myself.","I was really creative. I started to dance very young. I loved to dance. I begged my mother to put me into dance classes, and finally, in third grade, she did. Tap and jazz, but not ballet.","When people find out you're an actress, they Google you.","I never knew my father. He was never married to my mother; he was never a part of my life. It was just my mom, my brother and me.","My mother was a teacher. She was grooming my brother and me to be successful, accomplished people.","I wanted to be famous; I wanted to perform. Those things I really, really wanted more than anything else.","I don't have children, and I don't want children.","What took time for my mom was getting the pronouns right and calling me by a different name. Laverne was my middle name before I transitioned.","I was an actress long before I was a reality TV person."],"Lavrenti Lopes":["As a child I wanted to be everything from a doctor, lawyer, flight attendant to an IT pro- fessional and could never make up my mind. I figured as an actor I'd get to play all these professions.","Prejudices and preferences exist and will continue to. When you learn how to market yourself, you become less of a victim.","I think I was 8 or 9 when I did my first play. It was at a community level, but that's when I knew that this is what I loved doing.","Mumbai is home, so there's no comparison. But then again, New York's a lot like Mumbai, which is why I choose to live there. It's fast, crowded (in a good way), the people are friendly and it's full of color and race, like Mumbai. Unfortunately, the traffic's also just as bad.","I come from an everyday middle class family in India. The film industry reached us only through our television sets and cinema halls.","I admire Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman for their sheer dedication to their craft.","The roles for South Asians may have increased by a decent number but there has been a negligible change in the quality of these roles. We still have to fight stereotypes. Fortunately, I've had the priviledge of working with people who look beyond the color of your skin."],"Lawrence Bender":["I had one of those light bulb 'a ha' moments while screening 'Good Will Hunting' in Camp David in 1998 - Madeleine Albright and the Clintons were there, and I just became really inspired by all of these amazing people. I left the screening asking myself what I could do.","It's been ingrained in me, from my parents and others, this idea of making a difference in the world.","I am not married yet, but I think ultimately in a good marriage it is the relationship which is the most important thing. It is not a matter of who is right and who is wrong; it is a one plus one equals more than two.","Film is a very collaborative medium. If you're smart enough, you learn how to maintain your vision while drawing resourcefully from all the people around you.","Sure, 'An Inconvenient Truth' was my first documentary. What a wonderful experience. I saw Al Gore doing his slideshow presentation, and had this nutty idea that we had to make a movie out of it.","Being with Al Gore on the red carpet in Cannes was exciting - he's like a rock star unto himself!","I was with - he wasn't the president then, but - Barack Obama, when he was running, in Washington, during Black Congressional Caucus Weekend, and did a panel about global warming with him. It was almost as if I switched careers for a while, and became a political activist.","If you go back and look at President Reagan's speeches, they bring you to tears almost.","You know, people have actually changed the way they think about nuclear weapons now, post-Cold War, post-9/11. The threat of nuclear weapons is not so much Russia attacking the United States, China. It's not a state-to-state - it's obviously terrorism; it's proliferation.","There are definitely strictly independent movies. 'Gummo' is one. Another is one I made, 'Fresh,' a $3 million movie which Boaz Yakin directed.","What I would say to filmmakers, if I may be so bold or so arrogant, is to draw inspiration from other filmmakers, but go to the place in your own gut where everything is nothing. That's a very Zen thing to say, but that place of nothing is where real creativity comes out of.","Being scared is really a good thing. It's being scared of being scared that's bad. Being scared of walking through your fear, going to a place of true creativity - that's what an artist is, that's what he does. If you do that, then being inspired by your contemporaries or people from the past is really great.","In 1998, I was screening 'Good Will Hunting' at Camp David. And I was saying, 'Nice to meet you, Mr. President. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Clinton.' Madeleine Albright, Sandy Berger, Senator Daschle. It was an extraordinary day.","Honestly, when I had the idea to make 'An Inconvenient Truth,' and I was going out and raising the money, and I said, 'I want to make a movie about Al Gore's slide show, will you give me a million dollars?' People thought I was insane, looked at me cross-eyed.","The average ordinary citizen can do a lot of different things when it comes to the climate crisis.","To be sure, governments will remain critical to any comprehensive effort to save our planet.","Making movies is my profession. I like doing it a lot.","After 'An Inconvenient Truth' came out, a lot of people came to me with their causes, and there are a lot - water, poverty, and so many, many more."],"Lawrence Block":["I can't persuade myself that one of the problems facing the planet today might be a shortage of books by me.","I've always essentially been a New Yorker.","New York is an ugly city, a dirty city... But there is one thing about it. Once you have lived in New York and it has become your home, no place else is good enough.","I really don't write much anymore, and I'm not uncomfortable with that. I've tried writing and the sentences come out fine, but I write a few pages and I don't want to go on.","When you get older, keeping the private stuff private seems less important.","To say I drank my way into marriage isn't much of an exaggeration, and it's none at all to say I drank my way out of it.","I never know what I'm going to write next, and when I think I do I usually turn out to be mistaken.","I don't plan an awful lot in life just as I don't plan an awful lot in my fiction.","Why on earth should I care whether people read me with their eyes or their ears?","Asking me why I did or didn't do anything is generally pointless. How do I know? And asking me what I'll do in the future is even less rewarding."],"Lawrence Blume":["As soon as I had the camera in my hand for the first time, I just fell in love.","I grew up addicted to 'Star Trek' and 'Mission: Impossible.' Now I switch between 'South Park' and 'C-Span.'","Having a few companies controlling everything we read, see or hear is destroying our culture.","Over the years, many producers have come and gone, and screenplays were written and abandoned. It's the Hollywood process. It's hard to get things done.","Everybody eventually discovers that they are an individual with the power to affect their own lives and make it better or not."],"Lawrence Clark Powell":["Write to be understood, speak to be heard, read to grow.","We are the children of a technological age. We have found streamlined ways of doing much of our routine work. Printing is no longer the only way of reproducing books. Reading them, however, has not changed.","What makes a book great, a so-called classic, it its quality of always being modern, of its author, though he be long dead, continuing to speak to each new generation.","Books themselves need no defense. Their spokesmen come and go, their readers live and die, they remain constant.","Unless their use by readers bring them to life, books are indeed dead things.","No university in the world has ever risen to greatness without a correspondingly great library... When this is no longer true, then will our civilization have come to an end.","To achieve lasting literature, fictional or factual, a writer needs perceptive vision, absorptive capacity, and creative strength."],"Lawrence Durrell":["Music was invented to confirm human loneliness.","Travel can be one of the most rewarding forms of introspection.","Our inventions mirror our secret wishes.","It is not love that is blind, but jealousy.","We are the children of our landscape; it dictates behavior and even thought in the measure to which we are responsive to it.","The richest love is that which submits to the arbitration of time.","There are only three things to be done with a woman. You can love her, suffer for her, or turn her into literature.","A woman's best love letters are always written to the man she is betraying.","Like all young men I set out to be a genius, but mercifully laughter intervened.","A city becomes a world when one loves one of its inhabitants.","Music is only love looking for words.","I imagine, therefore I belong and am free.","Everyone loathes his own country and countrymen if he is any sort of artist.","History is an endless repetition of the wrong way of living.","I had become, with the approach of night, once more aware of loneliness and time - those two companions without whom no journey can yield us anything.","Journeys, like artists, are born and not made. A thousand differing circumstances contribute to them, few of them willed or determined by the will-whatever we may think.","It takes a lot of energy and a lot of neurosis to write a novel. If you were really sensible, you'd do something else.","Old age is an insult. It's like being smacked.","The appalling thing is the degree of charity women are capable of. You see it all the time... love lavished on absolute fools. Love's a charity ward, you know.","I'm trying to die correctly, but it's very difficult, you know.","No one can go on being a rebel too long without turning into an autocrat.","For us artists there waits the joyous compromise through art with all that wounded or defeated us in daily life; in this way, not to evade destiny, as the ordinary people try to do, but to fulfil it in its true potential - the imagination.","Truth disappears with the telling of it.","Guilt always hurries towards its complement, punishment; only there does its satisfaction lie.","Perhaps our only sickness is to desire a truth which we cannot bear rather than to rest content with the fictions we manufacture out of each other."],"Lawrence Eagleburger":["One nuclear war is going to be the last nuclear - the last war, frankly, if it really gets out of hand. And I just don't think we ought to be prepared to accept that sort of thing.","What is more important is that Foreign Service Officers understand business, about the needs of U.S. business and how to help U.S. companies make the right connections abroad.","What I can't quite see at this stage is that the evidence, even to the president, seems to be that clear. And if it is that clear, I can't understand why we are not capable of convincing our closest allies that given that evidence, they ought to join us in this effort.","We must advertise to U.S. business that we are there, that our attitude has changed, and that we care. When we are asked to help, we have to perform and provide the right advice.","We have to spend a lot more time training people to be good advocates of U.S. business.","There is a natural partnership between State and Commerce, and the American business community to work together to educate the United States about marketing overseas.","The whole nuclear thing is a terrible mess and it's hard for me to understand why it is that we, the United States, seem to be the only ones that are really particularly concerned about it and prepared to do something.","The question really is how do we get Embassy Officers into the minds of the American business community. That is a much more difficult task than understanding a statistical matrix.","The question is not really about a shift to the economic cone where officers are writing about the balance of payments and the need for economic stabilization.","The point is, once they have a missile that can hit the United States, we are now back in the kind of game we used to worry about with the Soviet Union, only the Soviet Union was more mature about this whole thing than I think the North Koreans will be.","That said, there is a tendency to help the large industrial conglomerate more quickly than the small company you have never heard of. That is something in the culture we are trying to change.","Some day, somebody is going to have to start talking about what happens to us all a decade from now if we let these North Koreans and the Iranians go forward with their nuclear weapons program.","Small- and medium-sized companies do not know what we have to offer and that needs to be changed. We must react just as strenuously on their behalf as we do for larger companies.","Now there is a cultural change under way in the Foreign Service.","My point here is I think international pressures of our acting unilaterally again are going to be such that the administration will say, well, we just can't take this on now.","In the best of all worlds everyone in the Embassy is doing something to assist U.S. exports.","In a time of constrained resources we will have to shift emphasis. but not necessarily from the traditional Political Officer to the traditional Economic Officer.","I think what he's - what he believes, and he may be correct, I don't know, that we have some intelligence information that leads us to know some things about what's going on in Iraq that we haven't revealed to others.","Any Ambassador or Foreign Service Officer who has his or her head screwed on right knows that the U.S. position in the world is far more dependent on our ability to compete in world markets.","And beyond that, the next issue is how do we guarantee one of these weapons, not necessarily this missile, but nuclear weapons ends up in the hands of Al Qaeda or some other terrorist group.","The fact of the matter is that if we were going to do anything about Gaddafi, it should have been at the beginning. And by fooling around like this as long as we have, we have wasted an opportunity that would have gotten rid of him.","My father was somewhat to the right of Genghis Khan.","There are sometimes problems for which there is no immediate solution, and there are sometimes problems for which there is no solution.","I believe that sooner or later we're going to have to deal with Saddam Hussein, because of his general reputation, because of what I'm convinced he's done with regard to terrorism and the support thereof. But I'm not at all sure I believe that it has to be right now.","My own view of this, by the way, is, if the war on terrorism is successful over time, in its own way it's going to box Saddam in in a way that's going to make it much more difficult for him to maintain his power, and that he's going to become increasingly isolated. I think that's going to take time.","There are a lot of other terrorist targets we ought to be focusing on. Well, there is Syria, for example, which is pumping through - because of Iran, is pumping weapons on into Hezbollah and so forth - which is then producing a lot of agony in Palestine and in Israel. We ought to be doing a bit to try to stop that.","There's Hezbollah, there's Hamas, there is a whole range of terrorist targets out there related to Palestine and to Israel that we ought to be trying to deal with. And there's a great deal of targets in the Philippines, Indonesia. You name it, there are a number of places where there are targets that we ought to be trying to deal with.","The consequence of a world full of nuclear powers to me is so incomprehensible in terms of the dangers that that implies.","If we had made it clear from the very beginning that we were not going to tolerate another nuclear power on the face of the earth, and had done it in Korea, where we could have accomplished it militarily, if necessary, I would put a stop to it and would have put a stop to it there."],"Lawrence Ferlinghetti":["Southern California, where the American Dream came too true.","We have to raise the consciousness; the only way poets can change the world is to raise the consciousness of the general populace.","I think if there's a great depression there might be some hope.","Freedom of speech is always under attack by Fascist mentality, which exists in all parts of the world, unfortunately.","Constantly risking absurdity and death whenever he performs above the heads of his audience, the poet, like an acrobat, climbs on rhyme to a high wire of his own making.","It's much easier to consume the visual image than to read something.","I am waiting for them to prove that God is really American.","Don't patronize the chain bookstores. Every time I see some author scheduled to read and sign his books at a chain bookstore, I feel like telling him he's stabbing the independent bookstores in the back.","They were looking for a stable, but we didn't have one.

Only the ignorant and narrow-minded gossip, for they speak of persons instead of things.","Nobody needs a smile so much as the one who has none to give. So get used to smiling heart-warming smiles, and you will spread sunshine in a sometimes dreary world.","Do not take yourself too seriously. You have to learn not to be dismayed at making mistakes. No human being can avoid failures.","Strength of character means the ability to overcome resentment against others, to hide hurt feelings, and to forgive quickly.","The practice of patience toward one another, the overlooking of one another's defects, and the bearing of one another's burdens is the most elementary condition of all human and social activity in the family, in the professions, and in society.","A sarcastic person has a superiority complex that can be cured only by the honesty of humility.","Try to make at least one person happy every day. If you cannot do a kind deed, speak a kind word. If you cannot speak a kind word, think a kind thought. Count up, if you can, the treasure of happiness that you would dispense in a week, in a year, in a lifetime!","Kind words are a creative force, a power that concurs in the building up of all that is good, and energy that showers blessings upon the world.","A gentleman has his eyes on all those present; he is tender toward the bashful, gentle toward the distant, and merciful toward the absent.","Cheerfulness is a very great help in fostering the virtue of charity. Cheerfulness itself is a virtue.","You are just as capable of making a mistake as anyone else. By insisting too eagerly upon a small right, you may turn it into a wrong against yourself and also against your neighbor.","Have you noticed in your past experience that your kind interpretations were almost always truer than you harsh one?","If, when you charged a person with his faults, you credited him with his virtues too, you would probably like everybody.","Only a kind person is able to judge another justly and to make allowances for his weaknesses. A kind eye, while recognizing defects, sees beyond them."],"Lawrence Gilliard, Jr.":["I went to Juilliard as a clarinet major, and somewhere between the beginning and the end, I stopped playing it. I asked myself who was I reaching... I just fell out of love with it.","Although I was born in New York, I moved to Baltimore when I was young. And I like to say New York birthed me, but Baltimore raised me. A big part of my heart was always in Baltimore.","Once I got the job on 'Walking Dead,' I started thinking about how I always wanted to get back to the East Coast. My mom lives in Baltimore, and I have a lot of family in Baltimore and New York.","The plan was to go Juilliard, graduate, and then go across the street and play in the New York Philharmonic - that was the plan, anyway.","What the School for the Arts taught me was a great work ethic. They showed me - not just taught me - that if you work hard, you can see the effects. They gave me that lesson, and I have used it at every stage of my life. And I am still using it now in my new role on 'The Walking Dead.'"],"Lawrence Halprin":["Because the quality of living with nature and allowing it to manifest itself is different than the quality of living in a city, especially a dense city.","Let me just say something that I forgot, I also hoped and this was very true in the beginning - that this would also be a place that people would be able to walk in to the fountain and use it in a nice way of reading and examining the quotations on the blocks.","And I think one of the tasks that I always feel is how to get that vision out of them. Not exactly what they want, but what they want to accomplish for themselves or their community or their family.","And you finally get to a consensus, where you get a sense of what really ought to be done, and then they give it to me and then I draw it. I mean draw it in the sense, the philosophical sense.","Because one of the benefits of getting older, I guess-there are very few benefits, really - most of them are a pain in the butt. People depend on me more; they believe in me more, they think I'm good.","Because over and over again, the times that I've done really good things is because I've had a wonderful client of some kind, and a lot of it depended on me to induce them to be creative.","I always say to young people when they ask me how I work, I always say to them, the only time you've ever going to do something good is if you have a good client. And by good I mean all kinds of things.","I suppose and I hope that the young guys who are out there losing their lives at least feel the same way I did. I shouldn't think about this very much because I'm almost weeping when I think about it.","Of all the Jedis I saw in the film, Yoda's the only one I like.","One is, that they will feel about you that you're going to make something wonderful for them. And they help you by expressing themselves. Not telling you how to do it, but encouraging you and accepting your vision and working with you on that kind of a level.","One of the things I thought a lot about was how can we get the views, for instance, the main plaza, you look up to Telegraph Hill from there and therefore it would be a disaster to close that view off.","The war, as I felt it and a lot of my compatriots felt it, was a creative act.","The whole memorial is for different senses... seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling. I probably would have come up with something different if I had not lived through it.","Then I sit down, work at it, because now I have a convincing feeling about what that place wants to be, you see?

Me and my talent comes in taking that consensus and then making something wonderful out of it - a work of art."],"Lawrence Hargrave":["The most ordinary conditions for observing sailing birds are then the wind and sea are both aft.","The closer the bird is to the surface of the water, the firmer and more inelastic is the uplift of the rising air. The bird appears to almost feel the surface with the tip of its weather wing.","If you direct your attention to the position of a bird with regard to the wave surface, it will speedily be noticed to be nearly always on the rising side or face of the wave and moving apparently at right angles to the wave's course, but really diagonal to it.","And from a poise at this station the plane may swoop down, at great disadvantage if close to the back of the wave, at various slopes and directions till it cuts into the air that is being raised by the face of the following wave, which again enables it to resume its velocity.","As to the effect of the wave on the air, we will suppose the water to be quite flat and the air motionless, a heavy undulation comes on the scene, it has to pass, so it pushes the air up with its face, letting it fall again as its back glides onwards.","Bent metal is worse than bent wood and weight for weight is more flexible.","Common sense steps in here and says: Separate the parts you want to be mobile from the parts you want to be inert. You have seen the result, and I know many have the skill to apply it.","It becomes a giant's task to compute the result when the effect of cross seas, wind at all angles and ever varying force, arched surfaces, head resistance, ratio of weight to area, and the intelligence of the guiding power crop up.","The plane is simply abstracting the power stored in the wave by a distant gale, and using it to counteract gravity. And if the work be continued long enough, or a multitude of planes be continually drawing on the reservoir of power, the wave must inevitably be flattened.","The wings are moved several times by hand to charge the crank chamber with mixture, which flows on through the external pipe and inlet valve to the compression space and cylinder.","To remove this obstacle I repeat or refer to such knowledge as has come under my notice, my own previously expressed views, and also describe and exhibit my last experiments and explain their novelty and utility.","Used as kites, these rigid stable aeroplanes are superior to the very best cellular kites I can make; they are lighter, pull harder per square foot, attain a greater angle of elevation, and have fewer parts."],"Lawrence Jackson":["It's all about work when you reach up, tap in and step on that field. You don't mess around when you go through that gate.","Many sports, not just football, have kind of the macho meathead mentality where innovation is almost frowned upon.","I'm signing on to be an athlete, and it's almost like Karl Marx's theory on capitalism. I am both the worker and the product. I'm choosing to be a part of this system, thus I'm choosing to be part of the conditions that are set in this system.","Lenny Kravitz is one of my favorite musical artists.","I studied philosophy and ended on sociology. For some reason, all the advanced courses in philosophy were offered 4:30 to 6:30, so I could never go because of football, so I had to switch.","The proper care and rearing of a child is integral to their development. It breaks my heart to know that some children's futures are being destroyed within their own homes."],"Lawrence Kasdan":["Being a writer is like having homework every night for the rest of your life.","With Westerns you have the landscape is important, and it's empty, and only you populate it. When you populate it, you can tell any kind story that Shakespeare told, you can tell in a Western.","Almost every other Western in the last ten years has failed, since Dances with Wolves.","I want everything I do to have humor in it, because it seems to me that all of life has that.","But, I think that the reason I responded to this book, sort of paradoxically, is that it starts out like The Big Chill, sort of. Four friends, who are not quite happy with their life, and every year they get together for a week and look for some comfort from each other.","You know, Stephen says, in the movies no one ever goes to the bathroom. They shave, they brush their teeth. He goes right at this sort of funny taboo we have about the bathroom, and he turned it into this nightmare, you know, your worst fear of what's in there.","What you hope for, like Unforgiven did a lot to give you a chance to do it again sometime.","The movies that made me want to make movies were action movies, and thrillers, and Kurosawa films, you know, where you have an opportunity every day to shoot it in an unusual way. I was looking for something like that.","The kind of pace that you want to use in a Western - just to acknowledge the land in the distance that everyone has to travel, and the way things develop sort of slowly - it's almost the antithetical of what's currently going on in the movies, you know.","The great thing about Stephen is that he sees the movie as a separate thing, I think. He wants it to capture the essence of the book, and if he feels that's been done, then he's not too particular about the details. I think that's why he's happy.","That was certainly true the first time, when I did Body Heat, the first movie that I directed. I was looking for a vessel to tell a certain kind of story, and I was a huge fan of Film Noir, and what I liked about it was that it was so extreme in style.","It's hard enough to get any movie made, and when you take on these tough genres - and I've done it a couple times - it just makes the whole struggle more.","I tell you, I feel like a real novice as far as horror goes.","I really liked Carrie a lot. That was one of Brian De Palma's best movies.","I mean, the trouble with some of the kind of relationship movies I've done, is there's only so many ways you can shoot a conversation. I was really tired of talking heads.","I mean, I really liked those guys and the experience of doing Raiders was really good for me, but I did not really want to be involved - I only did Jedi, as I really owed George a favor.","I loved Alien, and I loved Carrie, and I loved The Exorcist - those were big movies for me. They were just brilliantly done, and unusual, and they all took horror to some new place.","I haven't seen Clones, which has been during this period when I haven't seen much of anything, but I did see Phantom Menace, and see my feelings about it - see, first of all, I think that when you make a lot of movies, your attitude about the movies changes.","I didn't really want to do another sequel. I go to those movies, and I just sort of enjoy them like a viewer.","But, George and Steven asked me to write the Indiana Jones sequels, and I didn't want to.","Any story that Billy Wilder told, you can tell in a Western.","And you know, when you take on something like this, you read a book like this, you know that it's going to be an adventure.

That goes for economics, too.","Now you know my credo: Free-market capitalism is the best path to prosperity. And let me add to that from our Founding Fathers: Our Creator endowed us with the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In other words, freedom.","If the U.S. wants to destroy ISIS, it can destroy ISIS. We won't end terrorism around the world. But we can destroy ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Prominent generals are telling us that. Prominent national-security strategists are telling us that. So let's do it.","The eligibility for food stamps has widened and widened; welfare has been widened - unemployment insurance and disability insurance. These are all incentives not to work.","Obama and Clinton wrongly believe that the corporate income tax is a tax on the rich. The reality is that rich corporations don't pay taxes - workers do.","The biggest flaw in the Trump economic plan is the tilt toward protectionism. I have parted company with him on this. The question here is whether his campaign bark will turn out to be bigger than his government-policy bite.","It is freedom that makes this the greatest country in the world. And it is freedom that so frequently keeps me on the optimistic side of life.","The E.U.'s tax and regulatory policies, climate-change and welfare spending, and free immigration even in wartime are gradually ruining Europe. That's why I believe Brexit is good for British freedom, political autonomy, and the survival of democratic capitalism.","When the now-infamous Donald Trump-Billy Bush audio feed was released, my confidence in Trump all but evaporated.","Arthur Laffer has taught us, 'If you tax something, you get less of it.' That's why firms are moving offshore in droves. It's not about being unpatriotic. It's that it doesn't pay, after-tax, to invest in the United States.","In the 1980s and 1990s, radical change in economic policies fostered by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher put the brakes on government planning and ushered in a new free-market supply-side era and a two-decade boom. That model has been abandoned in the new century. This must be reversed.","Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders want to raise taxes on the rich, saying it will solve inequality. It won't. All that will do is significantly reduce incentives to work, save, and invest. But I say inequality is not the problem. The problem is a lack of growth.","Wars breed unfairness, just as they breed collateral damage.","JFK and Reagan's growth model included tax cuts and a steady dollar. Trump has taken a gigantic step toward restoring prosperity with his tax-cut-centered fiscal policy.","New WikiLeaks-provided e-mails from Clinton aide Doug Band reveal the true nature of the Clinton cash operation: No matter what the stated humanitarian goals of the Clinton Foundation, every fiber and sinew of the organization is wrapped in self-dealing, self-enrichment, fraud, and corruption.","I am a Reagan Republican: I believe in Free Market Capitalism; I believe in economic growth.","I never had any friends beyond a certain superficial level. We hate to admit weaknesses. We were raised to want to get ahead, to be good and clever and successful. You're just ashamed to open up.","True enough, the Fed needs radical reforms. In particular, it needs to replace its failed forecasting models and be rid of the academics who overwhelm the Fed system.","Corporate share prices should not be driven by political tax games. Profits, not Washington shenanigans, should be the mother's milk of stocks. And this shouldn't be a partisan political issue.","Facebook is a private company and, therefore, is entitled to whatever political biases it holds.","I have been accused of allegedly giving up my free-market principles in supporting some of Donald Trump's proposed policies.","JFK inherited three recessions from the Dwight D. Eisenhower years. And he wound up slashing tax rates across the board, for upper, middle and lower incomes as well as corporate investment. That's Kennedy the Democrat.","Hillary is not an agent of change. Nor does she have any idea how to restore rapid economic growth. Instead, she is a prisoner of the Left. Tax the rich, inequality, redistribution.","On economic policy, Pence has held to the key building block of growth. He is a budget hawk who voted against President George W. Bush's fiscally bloated No Child Left Behind education bill and hyper-expensive Medicare prescription-drug bill. He said he would not support new middle-class entitlements. He was consistent.","After World War II, we awoke to find our wartime ally, Stalin, had emerged as a greater enemy than Germany or Japan. Stalin's empire stretched from the Elbe to the Pacific.","Enforcing trade deals is spot on. Acting in the interest of American workers is correct.

Yes, there should be foolproof ID cards, with biometrics, for Social Security and employment purposes.","We were endowed by our Creator with the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were not endowed by the Federal Government. We were not endowed by entitlements. We were not endowed by pork barrel spending; we were not endowed by budgetary earmarks.","My crash and burn over drugs and alcohol is very well known; I've never, ever hidden that story. If there are people who would not vote for me because of that history, I understand.","For Clinton, I don't see redemption. She is a corrupt political operative of the worst kind.","A long time ago, I watched President Reagan repeat a few simple points about the benefits for everyone of lower taxes, light regulations, and limited government. Successful policies are sold by repetition, not unrelated tangents.","Middle-income wage earners have essentially had no pay increases since 2000.","According to Breitbart, data from the Federal Election Commission show that Facebook staff gave $114,000 to Hillary Clinton. The next-closest recipient of political money was former Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio. He only got $16,604.","Trump has the opportunity to be the president who, like Harry Truman, redirected U.S. foreign policy for a generation.","I believe China is a major trade violator. The Chinese break all the rules. They counterfeit our goods, steal our international property rights, and hack the computers of our industries and government. Something must be done about it.","After 25 quarters of so-called recovery under Obama, it has increased a total of only 14.3 percent. Compare this to earlier periods. After the JFK tax cuts of the early 1960s, the economy grew in total by roughly 40 percent. After the Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s, the economy grew by a total of 34 percent.","From 1950 to 2000, the U.S. economy grew at an average rate of 3.5 percent. That generated a massive gain in real GDP per person from $16,000 to over $50,000. A huge win for the middle class.","Research has shown that middle-income wage earners would benefit most from a large reduction in corporate tax rates. The corporate tax is not a rich-man's tax. Corporations don't even pay it. They just pass the tax on in terms of lower wages and benefits, higher consumer prices, and less stockholder value.","I am continuing to explore a run in the Senate from Connecticut, absolutely exploring it. In fact, I would say exploring it intensely.","Nobody, in my lifetime, in either party, has reached out with a message of hope, growth and opportunity to minorities better than Jack Kemp.","I am not a politician; I've never run for anything in my life. I'm an economist. I'm a broadcaster. I've been an adviser. I worked for Ronald Reagan.","We got our freedom and our liberty from the Creator, from God.

I cannot fathom her plans for increased regulatory burdens, which include more government-run healthcare and a halt to the fossil-fuel energy boom.","I don't want to be partisan here. But please, tell me how you get out of a business recession by raising business taxes and regulations?","As a free-market guy, I love competition. That includes political competition.","The E.U. needs Britain more than Britain needs the E.U. The London Stock Exchange is one of the most powerful financial centers in the world.

It's a simple formula that has worked for Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn and all the greatest investment gurus over the years. Ready? Buy low, sell high.","It turns out that Donald Trump has been very good at buying low and selling high, and it helps account for his amazing business success.","Under Bill Clinton's HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo, Community Reinvestment Act regulators gave banks higher ratings for home loans made in 'credit-deprived' areas. Banks were effectively rewarded for throwing out sound underwriting standards and writing loans to those who were at high risk of defaulting.","When George W. Bush tried to roll back taxpayer exposure to a housing crash via Fannie and Freddie, guess what two senators joined a filibuster of the Bush initiative? Yep... those saviors of the working class, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. They went to bat for the housing industry and voted to allow taxpayer exposure to escalate.","New tech explosions create winners and losers, but overall are remarkably positive for the country, middle-class folks, the economy, jobs, and wages.","When businesses don't spend and invest, they don't hire and cannot offer better-paying jobs. Business investment and wages are two sides of the same mirror. If a company purchases five trucks rather than 10, there are five fewer trucking jobs.","Obamacare rules and mandates are job-killers.","Many people do not understand that business investment is a critical prosperity-booster, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and stronger family income. Put another way, rising tax and regulatory burdens that penalize investors and businesses also punish middle-income wage earners.","Kennedy had already, in 1962, lowered investment taxes on business. And after his tragic assassination, his broader tax proposals were passed into law in early 1964. And they worked. The U.S. economy grew by roughly 5 percent yearly for nearly eight years.","Hillary Clinton would raise taxes on so-called rich people, corporations, capital gains, financial transactions, and inheritance. Has there ever been an example where America has taxed its way into prosperity? Never. Trump has an economic-recovery-and-prosperity plan. Clinton has an austerity-recession plan.","Let's bring in Donald Trump. He wants to lower taxes across the board for individuals and large and small businesses, significantly reduce burdensome regulations, and unleash America's energy resources.","Trump's corporate tax reform would restore America's position as the most hospitable investment climate in the world.

This will not yield strong growth, lift jobs and wages, and make America more globally competitive.","Contributing to GOP unity, Pence is a churchgoing evangelical family man.","Trump-Pence is a winner for the GOP.","In Indiana, which has been hard hit by manufacturing losses, job declines, and shrinking wages, Governor Pence combined tax cuts with spending restraint to spur the Hoosier economy.","The economy has barely recovered from the so-called 'Great Recession', with a 2 percent annual rate of growth since mid-2009. Peak worker wages, business investment, and productivity all occurred around the year 2000.","Putting aside the growing threat from Islamic jihadist terrorism, most of America's problems are home grown. So when I say overthrow the establishment to fix the economy, and the brilliant businessman Wilbur Ross says we need radical new approaches to government, we're talking two sides of the same coin.","On immigration, Trump needs an articulate policy that aims to secure the border and keep out illegals while letting in skilled legal workers.","President Obama always gives lip service to lowering the corporate tax rate, but he never specifies a particular rate or an overall plan.","Many liberals argue that big U.S. companies don't really pay the top corporate rate. While this is sometimes true, it's mainly because, during recessions, companies lose money, and get a tax loss carryforward that temporarily reduces their effective rate. But during economic expansions, when profits rise, companies then do pay the top rate.","Corporate tax reform should include not just large C-corps but also smaller business S-corps and LLC pass-throughs. And nearly as important as cutting business tax rates is the need to simplify the inexplicably opaque and complex system.","Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, warned Facebook of the need for consumer protection and an open Internet, and according to 'The Wall Street Journal,' Thune has sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking how the company chooses its trending topics and who is ultimately responsible.","However Donald Trump came upon the foreign policy views he espoused, they were as crucial to his election as his views on trade and the border.","Trump promised an 'America First' foreign policy rooted in the national interest, not in nostalgia.","I'm a person who has a hard time saying no, and it gets me into trouble because I sometimes overreach.","Pat Buchanan attacks me as 'worshipping at the church of GDP.'

Alan Simpson of Wyoming, the co-author of the 1986 Simpson-Mazzoli immigration reform bill, has said the failure of that bill was a function of the lack of an ID card system.","While the Pence-Hutchinson immigration reform idea is not perfect, it does represent a useful discussion point for future action.

For that tiny fraction, the copyright is a crucially important legal device.","Remember the refrain: We always build on the past; the past always tries to stop us. Freedom is about stopping the past, but we have lost that ideal.","If the Internet teaches us anything, it is that great value comes from leaving core resources in a commons, where they're free for people to build upon as they see fit.","So uncritically do we accept the idea of property in culture that we don't even question when the control of that property removes our ability, as a people, to develop our culture democratically.","Before the monopoly should be permitted, there must be reason to believe it will do some good - for society, and not just for monopoly holders.","A free culture has been our past, but it will only be our future if we change the path we are on right now.","If the only way a library can offer an Internet exhibit about the New Deal is to hire a lawyer to clear the rights to every image and sound, then the copyright system is burdening creativity in a way that has never been seen before because there are no formalities.","When government disappears, it's not as if paradise will take its place. When governments are gone, other interests will take their place.","Americans have been selling this view around the world: that progress comes from perfect protection of intellectual property.","Notwithstanding the fact that the most innovative and progressive space we've seen - the Internet - has been the place where intellectual property has been least respected. You know, facts don't get in the way of this ideology.","A time is marked not so much by ideas that are argued about as by ideas that are taken for granted. The character of an era hangs upon what needs no defense.","Power runs with ideas that only the crazy would draw into doubt.","In these times, the hardest task for social or political activists is to find a way to get people to wonder again about what we all believe is true. The challenge is to sow doubt.","All around us are the consequences of the most significant technological, and hence cultural, revolution in generations.","Believing we know what makes prosperity work, ignoring the nature of the actual prosperity all around, we change the rules within which the Internet revolution lives. These changes will end the revolution.","Monopoly controls have been the exception in free societies; they have been the rule in closed societies.","This does not mean that every copyright must prove its value initially. That would be a far too cumbersome system of control. But it does mean that every system or category of copyright or patent should prove its worth.","By the time Apple's Macintosh operating system finally falls into the public domain, there will be no machine that could possibly run it. The term of copyright for software is effectively unlimited.","While the creative works from the 16th century can still be accessed and used by others, the data in some software programs from the 1990s is already inaccessible.","We have a massive system to regulate creativity. A massive system of lawyers regulating creativity as copyright law has expanded in unrecognizable forms, going from a regulation of publishing to a regulation of copying.","A free culture is not a culture without property; it is not a culture in which artists don't get paid.","A culture without property, or in which creators can't get paid, is anarchy, not freedom.","As we've seen, our constitutional system requires limits on copyright as a way to assure that copyright holders do not too heavily influence the development and distribution of our culture.","Copyrights have not expired, and will not expire, so long as Congress is free to be bought to extend them again.","The real harm of term extension comes not from these famous works. The real harm is to the works that are not famous, not commercially exploited, and no longer available as a result.","Now that copyrights can be just about a century long, the inability to know what is protected and what is not protected becomes a huge and obvious burden on the creative process.","The danger in media concentration comes not from the concentration, but instead from the feudalism that this concentration, tied to the change in copyright, produces."],"Lawrence M. Krauss":["When a person's religious beliefs cause him to deny the evidence of science, or for whom public policy morphs into a battle with the devil, shouldn't that be a subject for discussion and debate?","It is, after all, impossible in the modern world to shield everyone from nonsense and stupidity.","Keeping religion immune from criticism is both unwarranted and dangerous.","Education is far less about a set of facts than a way of thinking, than learning how to critically think. And therefore, what I always think should be the basis of education is not answers but questions.","Formal logic is mathematics, and there are philosophers like Wittgenstein that are very mathematical, but what they're really doing is mathematics - it's not talking about things that have affected computer science; it's mathematical logic.","Donald Trump's candidacy has been a source of anxiety for many reasons, but one stands out: the ability of the president to launch nuclear weapons. When it comes to starting a nuclear war, the president has more freedom than he or she does in, say, ordering the use of torture.","There are areas of philosophy that are important, but I think of them as being subsumed by other fields. In the case of descriptive philosophy, you have literature or logic, which, in my view, is really mathematics.","The biggest conceptual change over the last 100 years in the way physicists think about the world is symmetry.","For the record: Quantum mechanics does not deny the existence of objective reality. Nor does it imply that mere thoughts can change external events. Effects still require causes, so if you want to change the universe, you need to act on it.","Organized religion, wielding power over the community, is antithetical to the process of what modern democracy should define as liberty. The sooner we are without it, the better.","Imagining living in a universe without purpose may prepare us to better face reality head on. I cannot see that this is such a bad thing.","The universe has a much greater imagination than we do, which is why the real story of the universe is far more interesting than any of the fairy tales we have invented to describe it.","Richard Nixon, famously, conducted his foreign policy according to the 'madman theory': he tried to convince enemy leaders that he was irrational and volatile in an attempt to intimidate them. But this was a potentially useful approach to foreign policy only because it was an act.","Nothing can create something all the time due to the laws of quantum mechanics, and it's - it's fascinatingly interesting.","No one intuitively understands quantum mechanics because all of our experience involves a world of classical phenomena where, for example, a baseball thrown from pitcher to catcher seems to take just one path, the one described by Newton's laws of motion. Yet at a microscopic level, the universe behaves quite differently.","Aside from communications satellites, space is devoid of industry.","I can't prove that God doesn't exist, but I'd much rather live in a universe without one.","The illusion of purpose and design is perhaps the most pervasive illusion about nature that science has to confront on a daily basis.","By his own admission, Carson's remarkable hand-eye coordination allowed him to soar as a surgeon, and he used that success to build a lucrative reputation as a purveyor of advice for young and old. His book for young people is titled 'You Have a Brain.'","If our species is to survive, our future will probably require outposts beyond our own planet.","Neutrinos alone, among all the known particles, have ethereal properties that are striking and romantic enough both to have inspired a poem by John Updike and to have sent teams of scientists deep underground for 50 years to build huge science-fiction-like contraptions to unravel their mysteries.","A snowflake is another beautifully ordered example of what simple, natural meteorological processes can produce. Stars form by gravity, collapsing into spherically ordered structures that can remain in this form only if they release tremendous heat energy into the environment.","Immediately after the San Bernardino shooting, when it was unclear whether Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik were motivated by a terroristic ideology, the focus of the conversation was on gun laws.","Philosophy used to be a field that had content, but then 'natural philosophy' became physics, and physics has only continued to make inroads. Every time there's a leap in physics, it encroaches on these areas that philosophers have carefully sequestered away to themselves, and so then you have this natural resentment on the part of philosophers.","As a physicist, I've always found cosmology to be a rational elixir; it distances me from ordinary concerns.","The Internet is a clear example of how our lives have changed in ways we couldn't have imagined: a distributed information source, which is invisible to everyone, where you can access anything, and it's distributed throughout the whole world. Basically, communication is instantaneous.","The Bible is full of dubious scientific impossibilities, from Jonah living inside a whale, to the sun standing still in the sky for Joshua.","Teaching and writing, to me, is really just seduction; you go to where people are and you find something that they're interested in and you try and use that to convince them that they should be interested in what you have to say.","By no definition of any modern scientist is intelligent design science, and it's a waste of our students' time to subject them to it.","Religious leaders need to be held accountable for their ideas.","I cannot stress often enough that what science is all about is not proving things to be true but proving them to be false.","Symmetry does mean something different for physicists than for members of the public. It means that an object or a theory does not change when you make some transformation - either rotating or moving it or doing something to the equations.","What we can do is provide the tools, through our educational system, for people to be able to tell sense from nonsense. These tools include the scientific method, skeptical questioning, empirical evidence, verifying sources, etc.","Cabinet members may disagree and even resign in protest, but, ultimately, they must obey the order of the Commander-in-Chief.","If I knew what the next big thing was, I'd be doing it now.","For many, to live in a universe that may have no purpose, and no creator, is unthinkable.","Empty space is a boiling, bubbling brew of virtual particles that pop in and out of existence in a time scale so short that you can't even measure them.","We should provide the meaning of the universe in the meaning of our own lives. So I think science doesn't necessarily have to get in the way of kind of spiritual fulfillment.","To me, what philosophy does best is reflect on knowledge that's generated in other areas.","People are interested in science, but they don't always know they're interested in science, and so I try to find a way to get them interested.","Science is only truly consistent with an atheistic worldview with regards to the claimed miracles of the gods of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.","To the extent that we even understand string theory, it may imply a massive number of possible different universes with different laws of physics in each universe, and there may be no way of distinguishing between them or saying why the laws of physics are the way they are. And if I can predict anything, then I haven't explained anything.","I don't know if science and reason will ultimately help guide humanity to a better and more peaceful future, but I am certain that this belief is part of what keeps the 'Star Trek' fandom going.","A significant fraction of evangelical voters appear more likely to ignore the candidates' specific economic and foreign policy platforms in favor of concerns about gay marriage or abortion.","Whatever the evolutionary basis of religion, the xenophobia it now generates is clearly maladaptive.","One might rationally argue that individual human beings should be free choose what moral behavior they approve of, and which they don't, subject to the constraints of the law.","When it comes to the real operational issues that govern our understanding of physical reality, ontological definitions of classical philosophers are, in my opinion, sterile.","Empirical explorations ultimately change our understanding of which questions are important and fruitful and which are not.","Feynman once said, 'Science is imagination in a straitjacket.' It is ironic that in the case of quantum mechanics, the people without the straitjackets are generally the nuts.","It never ceases to amaze me that every second of every day, more than 6,000 billion neutrinos coming from nuclear reactions inside the sun whiz through my body, almost all of which will travel right through the earth without interruption.","Life has survived for more than three billion years because it is robust, and almost no mutations can easily outwit the defense mechanisms built up through eons of exposure to potential pathogens.","I have always felt that, aside from research that violates universal human mores, when it comes to technological applications, that which can be done will be done.","We need to walk into the future, no matter how unnerving, with open eyes if society is to keep pace with technology.","The rise of a ubiquitous Internet, along with 24-hour news channels has, in some sense, had the opposite effect from what many might have hoped such free and open access to information would have had. It has instead provided free and open access, without the traditional media filters, to a barrage of disinformation.","The root cause of the looming energy problem - and the key to easing environmental, economic and religious tensions while improving public health - is to address the unending, and unequal, growth of the human population. And the one proven way to reduce fertility rates is to empower young women by educating them.","For a physicist or a mathematician, the most symmetrical object you could think about would be a sphere, because it looks identical no matter what you do to it, however you rotate it in any given direction.","Symmetries are the playing field on which the physical world works and which determine the rules of the game. The symmetries of nature determine for us things that remain constant, that can't be changed. Those are the guideposts in physics, the quantities like energy and momentum.","The notion that anyone in the 21st century could take seriously the notion that the sun orbits the Earth, or that the Earth is the center of the universe, is almost unbelievable.","We should teach kids how to question. Now having said that, of course, to be a productive adult, there are certain skills that are required - reading, writing, and, in the old-fashioned days, we used to say arithmetic. Now we say mathematics.","I am in favor of saying, 'Okay, let's get teams of educators and experts in certain disciplines to say, 'What are the basic things that we think are an essential part of an early education for people?'' Put them together and create, as well as possible, a set of goals and tools to learn those things.","One thing I cannot understand - and people are probably going to be upset about this - is why local school boards have control over educational content.","I used to read a lot of science fiction when I was younger.","Scientists don't read theology; they don't read philosophy. It doesn't make any difference to what they're doing - for better or worse, it may not be a value judgment, but it's true.","I was most eager to see how Trump would respond to the climate-change question.","On the question of preserving public lands, Trump replies that our elected officials have spent too long rewarding 'special interests,' by which I assume he doesn't mean petroleum companies and the Bundy family.","On the question of information security, he claims that, in a Trump Administration, the U.S. government will not spy on its own citizens. If true, this would represent a turn away from the strong language that he has used about identifying terrorists on our soil.","When considering real-world issues, particularly those that touch on science and technology, it is harder to speak in platitudes or rely purely on emotion or fear. Substance, or its lack, becomes harder to mimic or mask, which is why I wish we had a true televised presidential debate on these subjects.","It's all too easy to imagine Trump issuing an ultimate, thermonuclear 'You're fired!' to China, Iran, or another nation - and perhaps to the whole human race.","Parents, of course, have concerns and 'say,' but they don't have the right to shield their children from knowledge. That is not a right, any more than they have the right to shield their children from healthcare or medicine.","Either Trump only talks to those who play up to his delusion, or he simply doesn't listen to those who might burst his bubble. Either way, that is a cause for worry.","For all of his bravado, obnoxiousness, hatred, and vitriol, the scariest thing about Trump, to me, is his unique combination of ignorance about the world, convolved with ignorance about himself.","For a man with an impressive educational C.V., Ben Carson makes a lot of intellectual missteps.","Local order in parts of the universe is always possible at the expense of heat and disorder dissipated to the external environment. The human body is one example: we take in energy from our environment to build up complex molecules that help power our bodies, and, in doing so, we release heat to the world around us.","When it comes to the things that people really want in science fiction - like space travel - the simplest things end up causing them not to happen. Humans are 100-pound bags of water, built to live on Earth.","If innovations were predictable, they wouldn't be discoveries.","Donald Trump called for the closing of borders to Muslims; John McCain said, in response to the President's address on the San Bernardino shooting, that 'this is the war of our time.' As that shooting shows, we react to terrorism with far more intensity than we do to an ordinary crime.","These days, gun violence can strike anywhere, from a church hall in Charleston to a movie theatre or a Planned Parenthood office in Colorado. But our response to it depends on whether that violence is understood to be terrorism."],"Lawrence Osborne":["Thailand was never a European colony, so even though the city is very Western on the surface, deep down it's very Asian. It's quite enigmatic, and I like that. I can't get to the bottom of Bangkok, and I never will.","The orchid's association in Chinese culture with such virtues as elegance, good taste, friendship, and fertility goes all the way back to Confucius himself, who was said to have a particular attachment to the flowers.","One of the reasons I like living in Bangkok is that, although it's a megacity, it's very saturated with nature - the vast and brooding skies, the sudden storms and rains, the vegetation and even the animals that abound.","More than 700 years ago, the Song Dynasty artist Zheng Sixiao created perhaps the most beautiful image of orchids ever painted, 'Ink Orchid.' And still famous today is a thousand-year-old poem from the Tang Dynasty called 'Orchid and Orange.'","I still miss qualities of Khmer life that are hard to quantify: the slow, sensual pace, the hovering presence of the past, the vast skies filled with terrifying and beautiful butts. And, of course, the food.","Exams are not very hard. People find them hard because they don't work - it's just a matter of labour. Once you actually start doing it, it's like cracking eggs. You don't need to be smart. As everything is in life, it's about concentration.","The best times to visit the Gobi and Three Camel Lodge are June, and September through October. By the beginning of November, it is ferociously cold, while October can swing surreally between warm days and clear, chilly nights and frosty mornings dusted with snow - perfect.","My favorite whisky bar in the world is in my adopted Bangkok. A refined and secretive Japanese speakeasy among the girly bars of Soi 33, it's called Hailiang.","Muslims do drink, as anyone who has spent a wild weekend with Saudi booze tourists in Bahrain will know. Those Saudi tourists are like teenage girls in Manchester on a Saturday night. But each country and region is different.","My mother sent me and my sisters to Italy every year for language school, so I spent a lot of my teenage years in Florence and Rome. After university I went to Harvard for a year, dropped out, and then went to Paris, where I ended up staying 10 years. It's different from being American: If you're British, you're expected to live at the far corners.","In Bangkok's budding literary scene, Prabda Yoon sits at the centre.","At the end of the 18th century, a young British explorer named George Bogle became one of the first Westerners to penetrate the mysterious and reclusive realm of Druk Yul, or 'Dragon Land.'","I don't know where this thing about me being a travel writer comes from. It's nothing to do with me; I hate travel writing. I don't do it - I do it a little bit, but not much. I don't believe in it. I think it's over. The world is so saturated now that you don't need it.","Asa Briggs was a historian of class history, so he felt obligated to bring in his driver. That's the English class thing that is much weaker now.","My grandfather was an amazing cap-in-hand guy.","I left New York after my mother died and, rather aimlessly, had settled in Istanbul for a change of scene. It was a rather dramatic gesture on my part, since I'd lived in New York for 20 years, but I felt I needed something different - the escalating expense and pressure of New York had begun to weary me.","To me, the contemporary novel suffers from a lack of sense of place - or spirit of place, if you will. It's not important to most writers, I must assume, or they try to research a given background on sabbatical. Not for me. I write about places I've lived long before I ever set pen to paper.","There's a distinct unease about Americans when they are outside the United States. I can't say quite what it is, but they are easily spooked or driven to cynicism - the country is diverse but, paradoxically, extremely insular.","I'll wager there isn't a human being on earth who doesn't believe in luck, however rational they pretend to be in public life. In reality, most of human life is luck - and, of course, its darker, more prevalent opposite. One only has to live long enough to experience both.","I've spent most of my adult life in the United States, and there the celebrity culture has been entrenched for a long time. It has made people almost literally insane, even those who make a great show of repudiating it. Those people, like novelists, who can no longer enjoy this status are condemned to despise it.","One winter, I went to Erfoud to research trilobites and got to know the quarries, the dealers, and the remote mining villages. They are not easy places to visit, and this was a completely unknown corner of the world economy: children slaving away on desert cliffs to furnish wealthy collectors in San Francisco.","I read Gide's 'The Immoralist' over and over as a teenager. I was obsessed with it. It's written with such simplicity and dread, and the desert, the shabby colonial world, is brought right into your consciousness without being over-explained.","I grew up in the small town of Haywards Heath, south of London.","My parents were bookish, very musical, but otherwise uninvolved in the arts or the academic world.","The drinker is a Dionysiac, a dancer who sits still, a mocker. He doesn't need your seriousness or your regard. He just needs a little quiet music and a gentle freedom from priests.","The English are very indulgent to episodes of alcoholic insanity.","Studies in the emerging field of cellular bioenergetics, a branch of biochemistry concerned with how energy flows through living systems, suggest that molecules from orchids might be able to repair decaying mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, in humans.","The Gobi is in many ways like the old American West, filled with abandoned hamlets and buildings, traces of disappeared peoples. Across its oceanic blond grass, horses and the black silhouettes of camels move languidly, as if they are the only inhabitants. Ancient Turkic nomads left enigmatic petroglyphs carved into boulders 2,000 years ago.","Mongolians are epic drinkers and carousers, and in this respect, they are extremely congenial to my own way of thinking.","There's something attractive about making people temporarily forget their actual age by taking them out of their normal lives so completely. Doesn't travel, by its very nature, strive to do this?","I suppose I reached the limit of what I could do with nonfiction books, perhaps because they never felt quite intense enough - it's a journalistic enterprise, ultimately, even if you are using the memoir as a form.","I made the decision that I didn't want to spend my life in rooms and write about rooms, or else make books that are researched constructs. I think you do have to get out there and live it. Thriller and genre writers seem to understand this.","New York was very congenial to me when I was young, like most people. I met my comrades in arms and partied hard. It's the way it should be, and then you get sick of it.","That's all you do in life: you find your perch, and if it suits you, just carry on. There's nothing Graham Greene about it.","Many travelers get into trouble in places like Dubai by assuming that it is sufficiently Western for them to drink as they do back home. But elsewhere in the Muslim world, it is quite controlled, and the non-Muslim will be steered down a fairly narrow path.","Arak means 'sweat' in Arabic, and it is the perfect Mediterranean after-dinner drink, in my opinion.","I have found that whiskey is enjoyed as a refined secret pleasure in many cities - and it appears to be popular in Pakistan, as it is all over the tropical Asian world, Muslim or non-Muslim.","Shoes tell you a lot about someone. Think of 'Strangers on a Train.' The first thing we see are Bruno's shoes. We know right away that something is up.","So many writers live their whole lives in rooms. You can be too civilised in the environment you have around you, too oriented towards speaking engagements and literary festivals and dinner parties. That has no interest for me these days. You get to a point where you don't care anymore. At that point, you can start to write.","Sometimes you can publish a first novel in a kind of lyrical flourish, but it is not really a lyrical form. The beautiful truths about the world are more hard won than that. Novels should be bleach boned. It's a question of cumulative observation and lived suffering. It takes time.","My parents were decent, aspirant first-generation middle class. They read 'Reader's Digest', listened to classical music; my grandparents had a bust of Stalin on the mantelpiece. The kids of that generation were terrified of being below par, class-wise.","I've got everything against likable characters. Likable characters are usually completely forgettable, and we don't really care. I think we love villains... precisely because they show us these disturbing complexities that I don't think nice characters do.","I think humans are migratory animals.","'The Odyssey' is a great poem to refugee-dom... Odysseus is not entirely a refugee... he's somebody who's blown off course. The entire book is an exploration of that theme... I reread it every year... That's not as surprising as it sounds, because it's a rip-roaring book.","Boredom and sexual desire are a potent and explosive combination, and people will certainly risk their lives to exit a grey and boring life.","I spent a fair amount of time in Communist Poland when I was young - my wife was from there - and I had the impression that boredom was one of the things that was undermining that whole society from the inside.","Military history is essential to understanding any history and, moreover, is a terrifying and sobering study in the realities of human nature - for yes, to me, such a thing exists, and history indeed proves it.","I love the novel as a form, as an adventure of mind and soul. Really, I absolutely love writing them; they consume my days and nights - what can I say? But I am an avid film student, too: I watch a movie every night.","Bangkok is infamously mired in lurid contradiction, but it's also a city of subtle and distorted moods that journalism and film have hitherto mostly failed to capture.","In 'Snow for Mother', a mother waits for her little boy to grow up so that she can take him to Alaska to experience the real snow, which he never knew as a little boy in the tropics."],"Lawrence R. Klein":["Although I was not aware of it at the time, the experience of growing up during the Great Depression was to have a profound impact on my intellectual and professional career.","I, Lawrence Klein, was born in Omaha, Nebraska, as were my elder brother and younger sister.","My early education was in the public school system of Omaha, where, retrospectively, I realize that my high school training served me in good stead for the basic subjects of mathematics, English, foreign languages and history.","An early fascination with higher mathematics at the university level blossomed into speculative thinking that could provide a basis for dealing with economic issues.","The completion of my undergraduate training at the University of California (Berkeley) provided just the needed touches of rigor at advanced levels in both economics and mathematics.","It came as a surprise to find that a professional society and journal (Econometrica) were flourishing, and I entered this area of study with great enthusiasm.","On the way from Chicago, I spent the summer of 1947 in Ottawa, helping to build the first of a series of econometric models for the Canadian government.","During the early 1960s, I decided to supplement research support for quantitative economic studies at Pennsylvania by selling econometric forecasts to private and public sector buyers.","The funds from the sale were put into research and general teaching budgets at the university. Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, Inc., is now a growing enterprise with many model and other econometric facilities.","After my first visit to Japan, in 1960, to work on a joint model building project at Osaka University, I maintained a continuing interest in the country and the entire Far East.","The SSRC committee turned attention from team research for building a model of the United States to doing one for world trade in order to investigate the international transmission mechanism."],"Lawrence Sanders":["I get up at 7:30. I grab a canvas bag and go out. I say hello to the people in the supermarket and liquor store. I buy the 'New York Times.' I go to the beach and think about characters and plot.","At 2, I start preparing fish or chicken for dinner. I don't drive. I don't have hobbies. I have no desire to travel.","Writing is the most important thing in my life - above marriage.","I'm not Gore Vidal or William Buckley."],"Lawrence Schiller":["Marilyn was a great actress, not a dumb blond bombshell. She was very smart, very astute and a good businesswoman.","The most important thing you learn as a sports photographer is anticipation - not where the action is taking place, but where it's going to take place. Not where the subject is now, but where they're going to be.","When you've experienced the real Marilyn, it's difficult to watch a movie about her.' I didn't want to have the memories of my experience tarnished in any way.","I knew Marilyn over a two-year period. I met her first on a movie called 'Let's Make Love.' I photographed her at that time on and off through the time of her death. I was 22 years old and she was 34 or 35.","You constantly felt like you wanted to protect her and that you wanted to save her and that's what made her attractive more so to women than even to men. That's why she's still with us. Marilyn Monroe never offended a woman.","A close friend of mine, Annie Leibovitz, who I've known for forty years, photographs celebrities every single day of the week but they all seem to look the same even though she's one of the most creative photographers alive. They all just look the same. Brad Pitt is a great actor but all the pictures of Brad Pitt look the same."],"Lawrence Summers":["Blaming speculators as a response to financial crisis goes back at least to the Greeks. It's almost always the wrong response.","The dramatic modernization of the Asian economies ranks alongside the Renaissance and the Industrial Revolution as one of the most important developments in economic history.","If you look at the history of the American capital market, there's probably no innovation more important than the idea of generally accepted accountancy principles.","I've always thought that underpopulated countries in Africa are vastly underpolluted.","It was wrong to allow Stalin to shape the European landscape of the 20th century. It would be even more wrong to let him shape the landscape of the 21st century.","In politics, as in poetry, it is sometimes true that it is darkest before dawn.","Global capital markets pose the same kinds of problems that jet planes do. They are faster, more comfortable, and they get you where you are going better. But the crashes are much more spectacular.","In the history of the world, no one has ever washed a rented car.","There are children who are working in textile businesses in Asia who would be prostitutes on the streets if they did not have those jobs.","The United States basically accepted protection abroad as the price of post-war recovery. Now, that these countries have caught up to our level of prosperity, it is time for them to catch up to our level of openness.","Now is the time for us to strike. We must strengthen our foothold in Asia, to ensure no nation overtakes us.","It says something about this new global economy that USA Today now reports every morning on the day's events in Asian markets.","Start with the idea that you can't repeal the laws of economics. Even if they are inconvenient.","It used to be said that when the U.S. sneezed, the world caught a cold. The opposite is equally true today.","The availability of private insurance provides tremendous insulation for millions of individuals.","Contagion has become very much a phenomenon, and it's a phenomenon of globalization.","It certainly was difficult to sell NAFTA because it's always difficult to sell open markets.","I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to it.","But ultimately what I was impressed by during my years in government was how much the intellectual climate and the prevailing intellectual notions constrained and represented the universe within which the discourse took place.","You can't have a situation in which companies proceed on a permanent basis relying only on cash from the government.","We are inheriting the worst financial system since the Depression. We're inheriting a situation - when people go back and study major banking crises a quarter century from now, the one that America developed in 2007 and 2008 is going to be one of those crises.","I promise you that there are a lot of people involved in various kinds of retail activities who think they have a crucial role in the economy, and they're right.","Many children are taught to believe in God. I came to believe in the power of systems analysis."],"Lawrence Taylor":["If they play dirty, then you play dirty.","There were probably about five games in my career where everything was moving in slow motion and you could be out there all day, totally in the zone, and you don't even know where you are on the field, everything is just totally blocked out.","Steroids are for guys who want to cheat opponents.","You try to stay within the rules for the sake of the game, but you can always turn up the intensity.","I had everything working my way, strong as a bull. And still I ignored the rules of the game of life.","But every day I tell my story, and be comfortable with my story and be comfortable with what I've done, and what I did, and how I am today, it lessens the likelihood it will ever happen.","First of all, a player has to know what is banned and what is not banned.","I have a whole different type of lifestyle.","And I tell ya, when I sit in that sound booth and started reading the script and starting to get into the character, man, it's an easy jump for me, because I understand what it's all about.","And once you cross over into that world, no matter how strong you are, you have to pay the price.","As players, we always have a way to get back at you.","Football is not part of that lifestyle anymore.","Hopefully the new breed of kids won't have to go through that hard lesson - my kids, my grandkids, my fans' kids, hopefully they won't have to go through it.","I don't live that life anymore, it's as simple as that.","I guess another message I'd like to say with this book is no matter how many times you fail... I failed a lot of times trying to get clean, and never thought I'd get to this point.","I like companies that try and break away from the norm.","I played one game, and one game played me.","If I'm going to break them, I'm going to break them both.","In football, you can always maim a person if you wanted to.","LT was just a wilder person. I don't go that route no more.","Most of the games don't let you focus too much on the cheerleaders, but I've been watching these girls.","People get hurt all the time in the game of football, it's part of what we do.","Taking them out of the picture, so to speak, what football really is, the savagery, the core root of football, it doesn't change. It really puts the real in football.","The NFL, and I've played a lot of years for them, and they have a lot of restrictions on their players, they have restrictions on their licensees, they have restrictions on everything.","They would almost throw the cops in jail when they tried to arrest me.","Well, actually, I do the voiceover for Quentin Sands.","You can take a substance that works in your system, but then you take this over here that's not banned, and this over here that's not banned, but if you mix them together, you've got a banned substance in your system.","You can't tell them anything, but hopefully they will learn from the example and won't have to go through it."],"Lawrence Tierney":["Put good energy out. Get good energy back.","People make fast moves around me, I react. I can't help it.","Hey, any time you're throwing bodies over board it is to save yourself.","Everyone that ever met me has been in love with me.","Where's my food? When is it coming? What did I order, anyway?","A sponge sees everything? A sponge sees nothing.","Mattresses! Beautiful! Let's go buy a couple of mattresses. Give 'em to people for their birthday."],"Lawrence Timmons":["I can't get carried away with having a good time because everyone, especially the young guys, have to know there's a time and place for everything.","We have to back each other up no matter what. Defense, you have to do your job, and offense has to do theirs.","Roger Goodell is doing his job. He's front office. Whatever he says goes, and I'll leave it at that.","I prefer to play inside linebacker.","I'm the type of guy that likes to lead by example.","I like to let my work ethic speak for itself, just things of that nature, like the way I go about practice and show these guys how to do it.","A lot of guys, especially the young guys, I try to do anything I can for them - on the field, off the field, anything.","I just want to be great. I want to stand out, be a great leader for this defense, and I'm just trying to leave it all out on the field.","I look at myself as a game-changer, and I try to make that a facet of my game.","I don't feel as if I have to force anything. I just have to play my game."],"Lawrence Welk":["Never trust anyone completely but God. Love people, but put your full trust only in God.","Over and over I marvel at the blessings of my life: Each year has grown better than the last.","There are good days and there are bad days, and this is one of them.","One thing all stage mothers share is an overpowering ambition for their daughters.","I have a tremendous desire to learn, and to grow, and to develop whatever I have that will make for any kind of improvement in me.","I knew nothing of the real life of a musician, but I seemed to see myself standing in front of great crowds of people, playing my accordion.","For a while we had trouble trying to get the sound of a champagne cork exploding out of the bottle. I solved the problem by sticking my finger in my mouth and popping it out.","If you put all your strength and faith and vigor into a job and try to do the best you can, the money will come.","Conversation didn't seem necessary when I put the accordion down and swung some young lady around the floor.","Whenever you have a minute I'd like to see you right now.","The William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh... was the place where Champagne Music was born.","One time I introduced my orchestra as the Shampoo Music Makers instead of the Champagne Music Makers.","In spite of the Depression, or maybe because of it, folks were hungry for a good time, and an evening of dancing seemed a good way to have it.","Dreams do come true, even for someone who couldn't speak English and never had a music lesson or much of an education.","His act may start out slow, but it tapers off.","If they can't hum it after we play it, it's not for us.","When my parents first arrived there, North Dakota had just been admitted to the Union, and the country was still wild and harsh.","We really were a very musical family. Father managed to buy us a small pump organ, and I just loved this instrument.","The ones the listeners loved most of all in those early years were the four Lennon girls who became the whole nation's little sisters.","The first time I try anything is invariably not very successful. I tend to grow slowly, but solidly.","Sounds always fascinated me.","Night after night I could feel the chills go up and down my spine, they played so well.","My accent remained terrible. It was very hard for me to initiate any conversation with someone I didn't know.","Music was my joy, my home, the one place I felt happy and secure.","Many times I wondered if I were truly carrying out God's plan for my life.","It's curious how we act in moments of personal despair.","If I live to be 90, and I'm planning to, I'll always love performing for a live audience.","If any performer has quality in his voice he can almost always be helped to develop all the other necessary attributes.","I was so anxious to succeed that I made a practice of appearing on all the disc jockey shows I could, in order to publicize the band.","I realized some of the pitfalls of being well-known; it was nice if you were successful, but it made it just that much harder to take when you failed.","I played a Spaniard. I looked about as Spanish as any other fair-skinned German.","I have never been an innovator, a creative genius.","I expected to be a farmer like my father and brothers. Life seemed pleasant and orderly.","I always worried I'd forget my lines or say the wrong words or the audience would laugh in the wrong places.","Duke Ellington was famous for hs very original harmonic patterns.","By 1969, when I celebrated 45 years in the music business, I also had 45 people in our musical family.","I just had an idea that went right over my head.","You know, it's a long world.","This is the best biography by me I have ever read.","I just wrote a book, but don't go out and buy it yet, because I don't think it's finished yet."],"Lawrence Weschler":["Genetically, I have tons of musical background in my life. My mother's father was a famous Weimar-era composer, Ernst Toch. My father's mother was the head of the Vienna Conservatory's piano department. It all canceled out in my case. I'm completely hopeless in music.","When you're a kid, your first five or six years, you converge all the time. School is about training that out of you, especially universities.","I am able to write musically about the visual. I can pick up tones, I can pick up themes. And I find visual art is a wonderful launching-off place.","I kind of write about visual art the way Roger Angell writes about baseball, which is to say, you're writing about life: it's a somewhat focused, limited terrain in which you write about everything.","I tend to write about people on the edge who are pushing things out from the edge but who are not necessarily big-ticket items."],"Lawrence Wright":["A donkey is a very useful beast of burden.","Societies that depend on natural resources tend to have certain inherent problems. The limited concentration of wealth - whether from oil, coal, diamonds, or bauxite - often leads to corruption and authoritarianism.","Religions prosper in large part because of the communities that they create.","I was a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War.","When I was in the ninth grade, I had a teacher in Dallas, Texas, named Elizabeth Enlow in English class. Every Friday, we had to write a little essay, and you had to incorporate three particular words into the story. That was the sole direction. And to me, this was so much fun.","To an outsider, Abilene was like a small landfall in the Sargasso Sea - remote, laconic, and forever closed to strangers.","Scientology is not a terrorist organization. Scientology has used intimidating tactics and vindictive litigation.","I deplore sexual harassment.","Hubbard set up the Church of Scientology in Hollywood in 1954 for a reason. He understood that celebrity was increasingly a feature of American public life, and celebrities themselves were going to be worshiped as minor deities were in the ancient world. The idea was: if you could get them, think how many people would follow.","From the very beginning of this movement, Scientology has always been a very closeted organization. That aura of secrecy is something that the present-day management continues.","There are many different rivers that lead into despair: there's poverty; there's political repression; there's gender apartheid - there's a sense of culture loss; there's religious fanaticism.","I love apples. I actually do eat an apple a day.","For my parents, leaving the close social quarters of Abilene was like getting out of jail. They were not true West Texans; they had not come to love the unending monotony of mesquite barrens or the high, hot blue sky that made sunsets a matter of prayerful thankfulness.","A documentary film is a great way of helping people understand because, somehow, when one is able to see the people involved, it lends a certain immediacy and understanding that is hard to get on the page.","When the price of oil goes up, the entire Texas economy takes a deep breath. Millionaires blossom like rain lilies. News races through the countryside that the money train is pulling into the station. Hop on board!","Craziness doesn't have anything to do with how successful a religion might be.","From the very beginning, when you go into Scientology your world narrows down very quickly.","I feel like a 1960s graduate student. I still work on note cards. I've never found a better system.","People often pulled into Scientology want to address personal problems in their life, and Scientology says we have technology that addresses these kinds of problems. Just focusing on the problems and trying to remedy them can be helpful.","I don't dispute Scientology can help people; I think that is a very important fact to keep in mind.","IRS is very poorly equipped to make a distinction between what is a religion and what is not.","I like the serendipitous surprises of reality.","Scientology is probably the most stigmatized religion in America already.","There are many countries where you can only believe more or you can believe less. But in the United States we have this incredible smorgasbord, and it really interests me why people are drawn to one faith rather than another, especially to a system of belief that to an outsider seems absurd or dangerous.","I get very antsy when I'm not occupied.","Journalism is a flawed profession, but it has a self-correcting mechanism. The rule of journalism is: talk to everybody.","Every medium has its advantages and weaknesses and there are many things I can put down on paper that I might not be able to put into film or into a stage performance. In each form, one can communicate powerfully in different ways.","To me the notion that Palestinians are actually Jews is, I think, quite revelatory and very radical and a possible bridge that has been ignored, I think, in this entire controversy and there's ample evidence to support it.","I don't want to constantly be writing about terrorism and strife.","You can't tell a story linearly if you want people to understand.","When I was trained as a journalist, as a race-relations reporter in Nashville covering the end of the civil-rights movement, we were strictly forbidden to use the first-person pronoun. There was kind of an electric charge around it. To come out from hiding and use the word 'I' carried a lot of fright for me.","When I went to Egypt right after 9/11 I was very upset. I used to live in Egypt. I had a lot of friends there. I spent two years teaching there. I had very fond feelings for that part of the world, and the fact that a culture I liked so much had attacked my own culture was really very upsetting to me.","I don't hold America responsible for the largely oppressive governments in the 22 Arab countries. There are repressive Arab governments that are our allies and there are those that are our nominal enemies. It doesn't make a whole lot of difference to what extent we're involved in propping up those governments.","If you have great characters, then your reader becomes emotionally invested in those people.","There are a lot of reporters who I feel are a lot more courageous and fool-hardy than I am. Maybe at the top I'd put Dexter Filkins. He's an extraordinary man in terms of his nerve and ability to get into dangerous situations and tell the story cogently. He's bringing back real human stories. I admire that.","If you're on a contract at 'The New Yorker,' the contract specifies the number of words you will publish in the magazine per year. I get paid by the word, like most writers. That's one reason why the Scientology article was 25,000 words long!","If you look at all those terrorist groups - I'm talking, going back, Hezbollah, Hamas, al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, ISIS - they're all proxy armies in an Islamic civil war.","The Israelis and the Palestinians don't know each other. They live right there, but they've become strangers. And it makes it much more difficult to make peace with a person you really don't know, and that's an obstacle in itself.","Islam and the West have clashed in the past and have not clashed. There is nothing inevitable about it.","When I was working on the al-Zawahiri piece, a large part of it published in 'The New Yorker' in 2002, I had spoken to a lot of Zawahiri's friends, people who had been in prison with him, people that had been in al-Jihad with him. And quite to my surprise, they liked that article a lot.","Contempt for men pervades the most obscure strata of our society.","I've always worried that one day women would figure out how to get along without us and they would be able to reproduce unilaterally, like sponges.","I'm grateful for the ascendancy of women in business and politics, which may yet advance the humanity of those callings.","Dallas was a place where dreamers like my father were given a chance.","Dallas was not a caring city, but it was efficient.","The lovely thing about the writing life is that you can point it in any direction.","The ideal 'New Yorker' profile is a person, an interesting person, at a critical point in his life.","What is interesting to me about film, and documentary film in particular, is that I can write about these people, and you trust my judgment, more or less, but when you're confronted yourself with humans who are right there on the screen telling you their story, you make a judgment yourself that is conclusive.","If you look at Mormonism, it's a very appealing community. It takes care of itself; there are active charities. It's got a successful work ethic. Whatever you might think about the authenticity of their theology or their history, it's immaterial in terms of how the religion itself actually functions.","The Middle East has been a part of my life since I was a young man, when I went to teach in Cairo.","I spent two years in Cairo, and I felt a certain urgency about trying to understand the region and the conflict here, in the modest way that a journalist might be able to try and shed some understanding and enlightenment on a region that is profoundly conflicted, and a conflict that has real consequences for Americans.","What I've learned is that everybody really wants to sell their story. No matter who they are, everybody feels that what they're doing is the right thing, and if they could only explain themselves to a reasonable person that understands them, then maybe they'll listen.","In places where money comes out of the ground, luck and a willingness to take risks are the main denominators that determine one's future, not talent or education or hard work. Money that is so easily acquired somehow comes to seem well deserved, because those who have it must be either uniquely perspicacious or divinely favored.","The 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. and coalition partners stands as one of the greatest blunders in American history. The Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, rose out of the the chaos, throwing the region into turmoil that hasn't been equaled since the fall of the Ottoman Empire.","This age of terror will end one day, but whether our society can restore the feeling of freedom that once was our birthright is hard to predict.","When you're first starting on a project, you feel shy because you don't know very much, and you know that you're going to be ignorant and seem ignorant.","People love to talk about the things that are important to them, but oftentimes as a journalist, if you're entering a world that's pretty esoteric and difficult to penetrate and has many barriers to outsiders, then the people inside that world just don't have the same language as you do.","I was a very religious teenager, and I moved away from that.","Oftentimes, when I was reporting on conflict somewhere in the world or prison or wherever I might be, I'd be struck by the fact that religious beliefs were sometimes transformative, sometimes a motivation for violence.","I guess I made a resolution years ago that I would only do things that were only really important or really fun.","Life gives you so many alternatives to choose from, and... you judge these as best as you can until something comes along like 9/11. And it's the central event of my lifetime, so I knew I had to write about that.","I was in Austin on 9/11, and there were no flights, so I couldn't get to New York to cover the story, so I had to find more creative ways.","I think the commentarian has taken over, so now what you get is a lot less reporting and more opinion.","Every form has its merits. And I like to work in a lot of different forms.","I got my initiation into the Middle East in 1969 when I went there to teach at the American University in Cairo for two years.","It's their belief, their own will, that holds people in Scientology, even oftentimes when they have been abused.","Certainly, the two things Scientology has on its side are money and lawyers, but those qualities won't save it if it can't find a way to bring new members into the fold.","I've always been intrigued by why people believe one thing over another.","The U.S. is such an unusual place in the world because you can believe anything you want.","If you call it al-Qaida or bin Ladenism or jihadism, whatever you call it, it's proliferated.","Our intelligence community was extremely poorly prepared before 9/11.","Scientology plays an outsize role in the cast of new religions that have arisen in the 20th century and survived into the 21st.","If you get into Scientology, you will go to auditing. It's like therapy except that there is an E-meter between you and your auditor. That's a device that actually measures your galvanic skin responses. It's two metal cans that you hold. They used to be Campbell's Soup cans with the label scraped off."],"Layne Staley":["We try to be real nice and friendly to people, but sometimes they take advantage of that.","I've always looked for the perfect life to step into. I've taken all the paths to get where I wanted. But no matter where I go, I still come home.","I wish I could just hug you all, but I'm not gonna.","It was all about music, about getting your friends to come and see you play. I don't see that same intimacy happening very much today.","I sing like a lark.","My bad habits aren't my title. My strengths and my talent are my title.","Drugs are not the way to the light. They won't lead to a fairy-tale life, they lead to suffering.","I guess I can go anywhere I want. If only I knew where to go.","Whatever dramas are going on in my life, I always find that place inside my head where I see myself as the cleanest, tallest, strongest, wisest person that I can be.","Kurt and I weren't the closest of friends, but I knew him well enough to be devastated by his death. For such a quiet person, he was so excited about having a child.","People have a right to ask questions and dig deep when you're hurting people and things around you.","When everyone goes home, you're stuck with yourself.","Music is the career I'm lucky enough to get paid for, but I have other desires and passions.","There's no huge, deep message in any of the songs. We recorded a few months of being human.","I found out through the Internet that I have AIDS. I learned that I was dead. Where else would I find these things?","My bed isn't made, I'm tired, I haven't slept well for two weeks. I haven't been laid in a month. I don't have a girlfriend. I have a warrant for my arrest.","The songs are about things that we were thinking and we wrote 'em down, and when you listen to 'em, whatever you think it's about... THAT'S what it's about!","I started out when I was about 12, playing drums. I started singing when I was about 15.","I haven't read anything but regurgitated rumors. Nothing new, and nothing true.","Drugs will have a huge effect on my work for the rest of my life, whether I'm using or not.","Andrew Wood's death changed things for a few weeks. I probably got even heavier into drugs after that.","I don't take part in it the way I used to-the bimbos, the free beers, free drugs, all that. That's still there if you want it, but I don't really seek that out any more.","I don't think any drug that can cause brain damage, failing kidneys, hardening arteries, pain, and suffering should be made available.","There were a lot of drugs. We kinda just passed the time that way. For a couple of years we were all doin' anything we could get our hands on.","We survived a Slayer crowd every night for about 50 days and thought we could do about anything after that.","I don't do much else but stay in my hotel room.","A lot of power-pop comes out of LA, a lot of speed metal comes out of New York.","At home I'm just a guy who has interests that extend far beyond music.","Being me is no different than being most anyone else, I guess.","I was in a band when I was 15. We were a glam band. Then I couldn't afford to buy makeup. At the time that was the thing.","Los Angeles, I don't like that town. Too decadent, and it's slimy.","Music is the doorway that has led me to drawing, photography, and writing.","One of the first bands to break out of Seattle was Heart.","Our perception of songs that we've written... the meaning changes from day to day... to whatever stage we're at in our life and careers.","There are lasting consequences for using drugs. I'll still be paying for my prior use.","We started this band as kids, and as time has gone on, we've grown and are learning to accommodate each others' differences.","We write about ourselves because we know about ourselves."],"Laz Alonso":["You know, I think a lot of times what happens when we as actors know we're playing a bad guy is we get into bad guy mode. You know what, man? In real life, bad people do good things too and good people do bad things. So you don't necessarily have to be the stereotypical bad guy to still do bad things.","There was a day where I was sitting at my desk, working 90-hour work weeks, in a suit, looking at a computer, with all these pitch books on my desk, and I just thought, 'This can't be my life.'","I think the biggest lesson that I take from 'Avatar' on any set that I go to is just work ethic. Working with Jim Cameron, you're used to working very, very long days and you're very meticulous about details. He's very, very picky about little details, little character-isms and things.","You may have seen me in movies like 'Fast & Furious' and 'Avatar.' But I wouldn't have been able to do any of that without hard work and determination. You can accomplish anything if you just stay out of trouble and do the right things.","It's funny because when I got 'Jarhead' and 'Avatar' and all those movies, 'Leprechaun' still to this day airs on BET. I was thinking, 'Will they just let it go? I finally have a body of work that can speak much better to what I can do than just Leprechaun.'","My buddies all still make fun of me about the whole 'Leprechaun' thing, and I'm proud of that movie. I'm just as proud of that work as I am of anything else that I've done. I feel like where I was in my career at the time, I committed to the character.","As Africans Americans we often think about the tragic stories associated with our lineage, but there are a lot of triumphs. Traveling helps you learn about other aspects of our history, like the story of Christ the Redeemer. It's empowering and inspiring.","I've been very blessed to work in some films that I'm very proud of.","I like speed, so I like taking the jet skis out and hitting the water, or hitting the lake. In the winter, unfortunately, I used to ski a lot but I haven't been able to ski in the past few years because thank God I've been working, so that's a good reason not to.","When you are really in love, you become vulnerable, and insecurities come out of nowhere.","I love HGTV. I love working on my house and have really been bit by the 'luxury remodeling' bug. 'Million Dollar Rooms,' 'Million Dollar Listing'... any show that can give me design inspiration, I soak it in and try my hand at it. Home Depot is my second home!","There is a little bit of me infused in every character I play.","My entire life, I've always known that I wanted to be a performer, but I didn't know exactly how, where or when. I never learned or studied the craft, formally. I grew up doing martial arts and playing piano. But, something inside of me always said that I was going to do this, as far back as I can remember.","'Fast & Furious' is a well-oiled machine. Those guys really know what they're doing. The guys that work behind the scenes are just as important as the ones in front of the cameras. They are car enthusiasts. They live and breathe this world.","I love that period, between the '20s and the '60s. I love doing period pieces, and those eras are my favorite period in time, music wise, and the elegance and the way of being.","I'm a big fan of 'Star Wars.' Some of the most iconic characters of 'Star Wars,' we didn't see their faces but to this day you can say Jabba the Hutt or Darth Vader and people know what you mean around the world.","I'm a martial artist. I've boxed all my life. I work out. I studied Hwarangdo, which is a Korean style.","Eventually one day I want to direct, but as of right now my next cap that I'm looking for is the producer cap.","Growing up in D.C. there are so many different types of educational and professional levels. They call D.C. 'Chocolate City' but just because we're all chocolate doesn't mean we're all the same. In D.C., everyone co-exists harmoniously but the lines are still drawn. And people don't really step over those lines.","'Miracle at St. Anna.' I was challenged by Spike Lee. When he offered me the film, he looked me square in the eye and said, 'You start this film off and you end this film. I don't want a dry eye in the theatre. Can you pull that off?' He was dead serious.","I'm flattered that women think that I'm sexy.","I believe in my heart that 'Avatar' is going to be the revolutionary sci-fi movie for this generation, in this era.","I want to play roles that I'm proud of, that I feel a certain integrity about, and I want to continue to be truthful in the work that I do.","Being able to travel and see the world really makes me appreciate the blessings in my life. There are so many people that will never get a chance to see some of the things that I've seen during my travels. I'll never take that for granted."],"Lazaro Hernandez":["A lot of art and visual crafts are based on appropriating things.","Ideas come from somewhere. People don't come up with these ideas from nowhere. Something triggers your thoughts.","I think in today's world we've discovered what works, silhouette-wise. A body's a body.","All the young designers now are doing something interesting.","You have something that exists in your head, and getting that abstract thought from your head into something that actually exists is a difficult process."],"Le Corbusier":["I prefer drawing to talking. Drawing is faster, and leaves less room for lies.","Architecture is the learned game, correct and magnificent, of forms assembled in the light.","The home should be the treasure chest of living.","Space and light and order. Those are the things that men need just as much as they need bread or a place to sleep.","To create architecture is to put in order. Put what in order? Function and objects.","A house is a machine for living in.","A hundred times have I thought New York is a catastrophe and 50 times: It is a beautiful catastrophe."],"LeAnn Rimes":["I'm living life as best I can - but I'm not exempt from failure and making bad choices.","I want to make my music and be a happy woman, a good wife, a good mom and one day hopefully have a child of my own.","The world when I was 13 wasn't truly driven by tabloid magazines and social media and reality shows. I was able to have a little more of a private life.","You can't break what's broken already.","I think singing traditional country is wonderful, because I'm bringing it to my generation and to the younger kids.","Reba McEntire came through town when I lived in Texas. She had this amazing theatrical show with, like, 13 different wardrobe changes. I was eight and I was like, Wow, I wanna do that!","I'm not gonna apologize for who I am and what I've gone through.","I think it is important for kids to be kids.","I needed to become something besides the star everybody had built me up to be.","Everyone gets criticized.","I have a great time touring.","It's tough to break into this business - now more so than ever.","Janis Joplin is definitely one of my biggest influences. She taught me how to feel music, and I don't think there's anyone like her that could bring such pain and emotion to a song.","I am constantly working out-circuit training, jumping rope, and stair-stepping, and sticking to 1200 calories a day. It can't be something that you're doing to lose weight, and then once you do, you're done. I do it every day of my life.","What people don't understand is that it wasn't about Dean or Eddie, it was about whether or not I was in the right place.","Eddie and I are overwhelmed by the amount of lovely well wishes. We are blessed and.... I'm Mrs. Cibrian!","The funny thing is the songs that people think are about me probably aren't. And the songs that are probably are the ones they wouldn't think... so that's where it kind of is funny.","Twitter can be great and very bad.","I was told when I was little I couldn't have an opinion because you want everyone to buy your record and like you.","I don't want to wake up and not truly be enjoying my life and these amazing things around me.","Sometimes when I look in the mirror, I see a child, then I look and see a woman who should be turning 60.","I've been in therapy my whole life.","I had some wonderful times in my 20s, but your 20s are hard.","I don't believe it's productive to go around and badmouth anyone that I work with, because at the end of the day, we all have to sit in front of each other and agree or disagree.","I never, ever in my heart want to hurt anyone.","I don't like the word 'regret.'","People are so quick to judge and make decisions for themselves about situations they know absolutely nothing about.","There's been a lot thrust on my shoulders at a very young age.","My relationship with Dean was great, but ultimately it wasn't a fulfilling marriage for either of us.","I love London.","Keep your sense of self; don't get caught up in what people want you to be.","I'm very ADD when it comes to working out. I have to keep it interesting for myself or it just gets quite monotonous.","Online bullying has to stop.","Just because someone can sit behind a computer screen and have a different name and hide themselves, they feel like they can do anything to anyone.","I have a talent, I can sing.","I don't earn my money from trying to hurt people or get in the tabloids.","I don't ever want to bring a child into this world without being as healthy as I can be; it's as simple as that.","I have been blessed to have experienced so much in my short lifetime.","I've worked very hard for everything I have and nothing has come easy.","What's life without love? You can accomplish everything you want in life, but without anyone to share it with, what's it really worth?","Part of my therapy is to write.","I refuse to discuss tabloid rumors.","I've grown up in the press my entire life.","I'm Southern, so alligator tail is pretty interesting and yummy."],"LeBron James":["You have to be able to accept failure to get better.","I like criticism. It makes you strong.","I treated it like every day was my last day with a basketball.","You can't be afraid to fail. It's the only way you succeed - you're not gonna succeed all the time, and I know that.","I'm going to use all my tools, my God-given ability, and make the best life I can with it.","I don't know how tall I am or how much I weigh. Because I don't want anybody to know my identity. I'm like a superhero. Call me Basketball Man.","I think, team first. It allows me to succeed, it allows my team to succeed.","To all the positions, I just bring the determination to win. Me being an unselfish player, I think that can carry on to my teammates. When you have one of the best players on the court being unselfish, I think that transfers to the other players.","My father wasn't around when I was a kid, and I used to always say, 'Why me? Why don't I have a father? Why isn't he around? Why did he leave my mother?' But as I got older I looked deeper and thought, 'I don't know what my father was going through, but if he was around all the time, would I be who I am today?'","I have short goals - to get better every day, to help my teammates every day - but my only ultimate goal is to win an NBA championship. It's all that matters. I dream about it. I dream about it all the time, how it would look, how it would feel. It would be so amazing.","Every night on the court I give my all, and if I'm not giving 100 percent, I criticize myself.","When you have that respect from your teammates, it makes it a lot more comfortable.","My mom and I have always been there for each other. We had some tough times, but she was always there for me.","As a professional athlete a lot is going to be said about you - but I just try to move forward and try to achieve my goals.","I always say, decisions I make, I live with them. There's always ways you can correct them or ways you can do them better. At the end of the day, I live with them.","But sports carried me away from being in a gang, or being associated with drugs. Sports was my way out.","Once you get on the playing field it's not about whether you're liked or not liked. All that matters is to play at a high level and do whatever it takes to help your team win. That's what it's about.","I don't read books much.","As a kid, we would drive up and down 77 North - that's our highway - there would be office buildings on the side of the highway and I'd be like, that's what my house is going to look like when I get older. I'm going to start making my house look like this.","I laugh and joke, but I don't get distracted very easily.","But now, being a parent, I go home and see my son and I forget about any mistake I ever made or the reason I'm upset. I get home and my son is smiling or he comes running to me. It has just made me grow as an individual and grow as a man.","I hate letting my teammates down. I know I'm not going to make every shot. Sometimes I try to make the right play, and if it results in a loss, I feel awful. I don't feel awful because I have to answer questions about it. I feel awful in that locker room because I could have done something more to help my teammates win.","Volleyball, I could be pretty good. After a few practices I could be that striker, or whatever they call it.","There is a lot of pressure put on me, but I don't put a lot of pressure on myself. I feel if I play my game, it will take care of itself.","My game is really played above time. I don't say that like I'm saying I'm ahead of my time. I'm saying, like, if I'm on the court and I throw a pass, the ball that I've thrown will lead my teammate right where he needs to go, before he even knows that that's the right place to go to.","I was a Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan fan growing up.","Basketball is my passion, I love it. But my family and friends mean everything to me. That's what's important. I need my phone so I can keep in contact with them at all times.","But ever since I was a kid, I was always the winner.","You know, when I have a bad game, it continues to humble me and know that, you know, you still have work to do and you still have a lot of people to impress.","Maybe the ones burning my jersey were never LeBron fans anyway.","I make impact plays. I make game-changing plays.","In fourth grade, I missed 82 days of school. Out of 160.","If a great opportunity opens itself up, I would love to be involved... or star in a movie.","You know, I'm just 6'9\" and 260. And just so happen to be very good at playing the game of basketball.","Warren Buffet told me once and he said always follow your gut. When you have that gut feeling, you have to go with don't go back on it.","I like to get out and get up the court, using my speed and aggressiveness toward the hoop.","There are some teams and logos you see, no matter where you are in the world, and you know exactly who they are and what they mean.","You know, God gave me a gift to do other things besides play the game of basketball.","You know, my family and friends have never been yes-men: 'Yes, you're doing the right thing, you're always right.' No, they tell me when I'm wrong, and that's why I've been able to stay who I am and stay humble.","For me, already being part of a single parent household and knowing it was just me and my mom, you'd would wake up times and hope that the next day you'd be able to be alongside your mother because she was out trying to make sure that I was taken care of. But all I cared about was her being home.","I'm just a little kid from Akron.","I do have motivation. A lot of motivation.","Where I grew up - I grew up on the north side of Akron, lived in the projects. So those scared and lonely nights - that's every night. You hear a lot of police sirens, you hear a lot of gunfire. Things that you don't want your kids to hear growing up.","When you work out or you're doing anything active, it's more fun as a group. You may lose track of the time, and the next thing you know, you're working out for two hours because you're having fun.","When I was 5, some financial things happened, and I moved seven times in a year. We moved from apartment to apartment, sometimes living with friends. My mom would always say, 'Don't get comfortable, because we may not be here long.'","Akron, Ohio, is my home. It will always be remembered. Akron, Ohio, is my life.","I am just happy to be part of the Nike family.","Your teammates give you the confidence. They give me the confidence all year, all postseason.","I don't want to be called a point guard, but I can't stop it.","I'm confident with my ability.","The first time I stepped on an NBA court I became a businessman.","I'm not going to fight because I mean too much to our team, and I can't afford to be suspended for a game or do something stupid to get me kicked out of a playoff game.","And winning is a huge thing for me.","I won at every level - all the way since I started playing the game of basketball at nine. I've won at every level, won championships at every level. And, you know, it won't be fulfilled until I win at the highest level.","I love watching track and field - the 4x100 relay, the 100-(meter) dash, the 200-(meter) dash. To see what they're able to do, I love watching that.","I played football for a team called the East Dragons on the east side of town. We only had six regular season games. And six games I played tail back and I had 18 touchdowns in six games. That's when I knew I had some athletic ability.","Cleveland fans are awesome.","Akron, Ohio, is my home. I will always be here. I'm still working out at my old high school.","When did I know I had talent? I think it started when I first started playing sports, organized sports.","I'm a pretty funny guy, and I would love to do a comedy with a bunch of funny guys - movie-star guys, where they could help me through it.","I went through a lot of battles in high school.","I like being around people.","I need music. It's like my heartbeat, so to speak. It keeps me going no matter what's going on - bad games, press, whatever!","Being the only man in the household with my mom definitely helped me grow up fast.","I never get too high on my stardom or what I can do.","Well, I mean, to me, I think my ultimate - my ultimate goal is winning championships and - and I understand that me going down as one of the greats will not happen until I, you know, win a championship.","No place is better than Akron.","I hear my friends and my mom tell me I'm special, but honestly, I still don't get it.","Sometimes in the past when I played something might make me lose focus, or I would go home after a game where I thought I could have played better and I would let it hang over my head for a long time when it shouldn't.","I mean, when you grow up in the inner city and you grow up in a single-parent household, that's - those are humbling times, you know?","I was so used to going out and winning state championships and playing in the postseason.","It's always a struggle growing up in Akron.","I've always been an unselfish guy, and that's the only way I know how to play on the court and I try to play to the maximum of my ability - not only for myself but for my teammates.","I love showcasing my talents - not only to my hometown fans and my own team but to the world.","There are always people always asking you for something. But I feel like I have a foundation. I have a supporting cast where it doesn't bother me too much."],"LeRoy Neiman":["Eating is one of the great beauties in life. One of my favorite recreations... eating with friends, the service, the ambience.","It's not the act of arrogance to draw, it's humbling - you must use your God-given talent. And of all the people I sketch, in most cases I feel I have to measure up to the subject.","But 'Playboy' was liberating. I was drawn to it and went for it full throttle.","I always stayed in tune with my own ambitions and attitudes and I'm still my intractable old self, for better or worse.","I have always said to young artists that scholastic training and the studying of art history are crucial to fully developing as an artist.","I had a go at changing history - maybe not all by myself - I fought at the battle of Normandy, I slogged through the Ardennes, and I celebrated the liberation of Paris on the streets with beautiful French girls throwing flowers at me. I said good-bye to my first true love and discovered what I really wanted to do with my life.","Some people try to paint in my style. Some simply sell pirated copies of my work. Some claim to be my publisher or agent or even my exclusive representative, when they are not.","The big shock of my life was Abstract Expressionism - Pollock, de Kooning, those guys. It changed my work. I was an academically trained student, and suddenly you could pour paint, smear it on, broom it on!","'Playboy' made the good life a reality for me and made it the subject matter of my paintings - not affluence and luxury as such, but joie de vivre itself.","I guess I created LeRoy Neiman. Nobody else told me how to do it. Well, I'm a believer in the theory that the artist is as important as his work.","It's been fun. I've had a lucky life. Art has made me pull the best out of myself.","The businessman says 'If I don't do it first, somebody else will.' The artist says 'If I don't do it first, nobody else will.'","I've zeroed in on what you would call action and excellence... Everybody who does anything to try to succeed has to give the best of themselves, and art has made me pull the best out of myself.","I can easily ignore my detractors and feel the people who respond favorably.","I don't know if I'm an impressionist or an expressionist. You can call me an American first... I've been labeled doing neimanism, so that's what it is, I guess.","I love the passion you go through while you're creating.","Imagination comes of not having things.","As I turn 91 this June 8th, I have to admit my hours at the easel have diminished.","My lovely wife Janet has been in a few paintings. She is basically a reserved woman who has never sought the limelight. She has always been there throughout my career and continues to be at my side.","Every time I started painting it was like a new experience, but they all came out the same.","I hold doors open for all the women. Men can open the doors for themselves.","The people who love my paintings, that respond to them the most, they're spectators, they're not viewers.","I draw all the time. Drawing is my backbone. I don't think a painter has to be able to draw, I just think that if you draw, you better draw well.","I've got the public. I don't care about the critics. I did at one time. I don't any more. I did when I needed compliments. But if you get a lot of compliments, you don't need a critic to tell you, 'This should be done another way.'","It's a nice feeling to go out in the world and look for excellence - the best in man. My subject is very valid. It's about people, and about life.","Boxing is my real passion. I can go to ballet, theatre, movies, or other sporting events... and nothing is like the fights to me. I'm excited by the visual beauty of it. A boxer can look so spectacular by doing a good job.","There's no greatest moment in the arts. It's a life, it's a continuity thing. You can't have a great moment because it's spiritual. It's a belief, it's a calling. If you're an artist, doing your own thing on your own, it's while you're doing it that counts. It's a process. If you get too elated, you can get too depressed.","No, I never had any dreams. The process of art is a dream in itself. The artist just doesn't... you work out something. It's yours. You don't have to go to sleep to do that. You do that on the canvas.","I played an artist in a comedy called 'Rooster.' It was a zany film by Glen Larson, a friend who produced several successful television series including 'Magnum PI.'","It has been difficult to hold onto many paintings but I have retained a few. Possibly the current favorite is titled 'Big Band' completed in 2005. It measures 13 feet x 9 feet. It has 18 nearly life size recognizable portraits of the biggest jazz stars that I knew and saw perform in the 1950s, '60s, '70s, '80s and includes Wynton Marsalis.","I've met and sketched most of the great athletes from the past five decades and their movement, grace and energy have kept me captivated over the years. That's what the ancient Greeks first saw and that's what caught my interest.","When I paint, I seriously consider the public presence of a person - the surface facade. I am less concerned with how people look when they wake up or how they act at home. A person's public presence reflects his own efforts at image development.","You can't take yourself too seriously.","You know what I like about San Francisco? The women are beautiful, fashionable and smart. San Francisco is one of the only cities I like to visit. I love New York and Chicago - I studied there, and L.A. has the same people as New York.","The most important thing is to just do it. If I work at a higher level I have responsibility to do better than what I've done before. Sometimes the best happens - beyond possibility. Just do it. Can't worry about it."],"LeVar Burton":["As long as we are engaged in storytelling that moves the culture forward, it doesn't matter what format it is.","And it's here and it's ready and we can really revolutionize the way we educate our children with tablet computers, and I'm committed to doing whatever I can to speaking to whomever I can to send this signal - to pound this message home. Now is the time.","I fly my geek flag proudly. Absolutely.","I genuinely believe we have an opportunity to revolutionize how we educate our children.","We want a book to be a book. We'll have all the interactive bells and whistles but our intent is to engage young people in reading, not to show them a movie.","Because storytelling, and visual storytelling, was put in the hands of everybody, and we have all now become storytellers.","Yeah. I do. I think that we have to continue to expand the areas in which we want our kids to be literate. And social media's going to be a part of their lives. And why not? Why not give them a sense of what the rules of the road are?","All literature is political.","I'm enormously proud of the fact that Star Trek has really not just sparked an interest, but encouraged, a few generations of people to go into the sciences.","There would be no Star Trek unless there were transporter malfunctions.","We have an amazing advantage right now in that we have developed technology that is so sexy, so engaging for kids.","We can't afford to sacrifice another generation of American children to bureaucratic politics. We've got to get it done. The future, the health, the life - our nation depends on it and it's just foolish to think or act otherwise.","It's not about division. It's not about politics. My concern is how do we come together?","It's definitely true that there are a lot of the devices we used on 'Star Trek,' that came out the imagination of the writers, and the creators that are actually in the world today.","This wired generation is kind of cool.","Reading a hard copy book, and reading a book on an iPad are slightly different experiences. What they both have in common though is that you must engage your imagination in the process.","I've always been interested in gadgets and technology and I've always been a reader.","I have always been a fan of 'Star Trek.' I love Gene Roddenberry's vision of the future.","I'm excited to see how current and future technologies revolutionize the way we learn.","It is no longer appropriate for me as an American to sit by and expect my government to get it done.","The unvarnished truth is that we have spent the last decade funding the machinery of war, and our children have been sacrificed.","If we marry educational technology with quality, enriching content, that's a circle of win.","We had to figure out how to produce books in a cost-effective way.","I get most of my news updates from electronic and social media."],"Lea DeLaria":["What do you mean you don't believe in homosexuality? It's not like the Easter Bunny, your belief isn't necessary.","A woman will allow herself to be clouded by her emotions. Her reasonable thought becomes completely unreasonable over the most ridiculous thing. It's a girl thing.","Straight girls like me. They flirt with me to get whatever they want. Of course it works.","It's a cosmic joke that I'm a lesbian, because I understand men so well but women are a complete mystery to me.","As a standup, I try to change the world. As an entertainer, I try to entertain. And as a lesbian, I try to pick up the prettiest girl in the room.","No one has the responsibility to be out to anyone but himself or herself. I made my choice a million years ago.","I can't discriminate? Oh, that's ripe, coming from a straight white man. What's the matter, baby doesn't feel like he belongs? Well why don't you try a place that was set up just for you? Like the world!"],"Lea Michele":["I'm simple. I love hiking, going to the gym, doing some simple stuff. I love being outdoors, I love bike riding. Just stuff that's fun!","Every now and then, I have blissful moments of thanking God for all the amazing things that are happening. When I leave the White House after just meeting Obama or when I see my face on the cover of 'Rolling Stone' or when I meet someone who tells me that their daughter is inspired by me, those are moments that are incredibly joyful.","I worried that people wouldn't like me. Now I try not to worry and focus on being happy.","Trust me, sunscreen is so, so, so important and so I always wear sunscreen, but I still get really tan.","How many managers told me, 'Get a nose job. You're not pretty enough?' But I proved them wrong.","Theatre just fills me up so much.","I love being outdoors - hiking, biking, and swimming.","I was never pretty enough to be the pretty girl and I was never quirky enough to be the quirky girl. Boys didn't look at me in high school and think I was the pretty girl.","I'm a vegan. It makes me feel really good and bright.","I just moved into a new house, so I love spending time at home. Everything for me is all about self-care because I really feel that if I'm at my best, than I'm able to come to my job and really be feeling the best, so if I'm not working out or going on a hike, than I'm at home recharging and cooking dinner and hanging out with my cat.","I am an unconventional beauty. I grew up in a high school where if you didn't have a nose job and money and if you weren't thin, you weren't cool, popular, beautiful. I was always told that I wasn't pretty enough to be on television.","Working out for me is something I do when I feel like it. But it's really about feeling good and taking care of my body rather than having to fit into any sort of model or anything like that. I try to eat well, and everything I do is really just to make me feel my best so that I can come to my job or my personal life and just feel really good.","I want to be in 'Funny Girl.' And I want Ryan Murphy to direct it.","When I was on Broadway, my most recent Broadway show was 'Spring Awakening,' and every night I did a topless scene.","I don't stop. It's my nature. People have to tell me to slow down. I plan on playing every role on Broadway. I want to do 'Evita.' I want to do 'Sweeney Todd' with Chris Colfer. We want to do 'Wicked.' I'll be Elphaba and he wants to play 'Guy-linda.' I want to do movies, make music. 'Glee' is only the beginning.","I was a vegan for two years, and I really enjoyed it. Then, I got to a point in my life at which I wanted to do something else, so now I'm a vegetarian. You should make your diet one that best fits you and how you feel. Listen to your body. The most important thing is to exercise, drink lots of water, and take really good care of yourself.","I would tell 17-year-olds to be proud of who you are. Don't try to change yourself for others. Focus on school and your future. Boys and friends will come and go, just focus on you and your future.","I knew what I wanted to be at 8 years old - an actor!","I'm Italian and Spanish and Jewish. I'm 100 different things meshed into one. I think that shows girls that uniqueness is beautiful. They can look at me on a magazine cover and see me in a movie and say that they have someone they can relate to.","Well, everything with being vegan and vegetarian is a really big commitment. You have to do what you feel is best and what you believe in and what your body is telling you that it needs. I really think everyone should do what's best for them, and what's best for me may not be best for someone else.","I don't go out to clubs. You'll never see me on a table at a bar, jumping up and down.","One of my favorite things about 'Spring Awakening' is that it is enjoyable and important for both kids and adults to see.","I consider myself lucky to be an only child because if I had other siblings, my mother would not have been able to take me to every audition and be so supportive of my career.","I am a very outspoken person, and if something makes me uncomfortable, you will know that it makes me uncomfortable, but that's as far as it goes.","When it comes to 'Glee,' I feel like I've been in a relationship, and now I can mingle a bit.","Film is an itch I have yet to scratch.","I'm five foot three. I don't look like a lot of other people, you know what I mean? I look like I'm 12.","I am obsessed with Gwyneth Paltrow.","When I wasn't working on Broadway, I worked in a Bat Mitzvah dress shop and was the Cinderella of the shop - always cleaning and vacuuming!","I've always been such a fan of Habitat for Humanity and the work that they do.","Growing up in New York has influenced my style so much, and I have an amazing relationship with my stylist, Estee Stanley. We have so much fun with the whole process. She picks out dresses, I try things on and play dress up, and we get creative to see what works.","I worked consistently on Broadway from when I was 8 years old through 'Spring Awakening,' which I left in 2008.","I always knew that I wanted to work and I knew I wanted to be a singer and an actor. I knew that every choice I made would help me get to that point. So the better the choices I made, the more of a chance I would have to get to where I wanted to be.","I remember watching Barbra Streisand and seeing Jennifer Grey in 'Dirty Dancing' - these were people who acted like me and looked like me. Now it's great that everyone on 'Glee' is so unique and people can relate to us and look up to us.","I always sing Adele in the shower. But everyone should know you never sing an Adele song in public because no one's better than Adele.","But my main thing that I would love to see as a fan of 'Glee,' like I said, is to really get into the character and who they are and what they do outside of school. I think that that's interesting. And then of course the themed stuff and the album episodes are all really cool too.","I would love Kate Middleton to be in 'Glee.' Wouldn't that be fantastic? That would be great.","I make a vegan baked ziti. And even though that doesn't sound enjoyable, it really is.","I didn't know I could sing until I auditioned for 'Les Miserables.' My friend was auditioning, and I wanted to audition too.","When I was a little kid, my mother and I used to watch the 'Golden Globes' and I would dress up and she would get sparkling apple cider and we would make a tray of hors d'oeuvres and watch it together. And I would get up and make a pretend speech.","I love being healthy. I get a lot of sleep. I'm a girl who eats. And I feel beautiful no matter how I look. I have my family to thank for that.","I can't believe it's been four years now, and from watching that pilot, we really all looked like babies. It's unbelievable just how far everything has come. I'm happier now than I've ever been on the show and in my life. I really owe so much of my happiness to 'Glee.'","I have been involved with 'Spring Awakening' for six years. I am 20 now - I just turned 20 in August - and I originally auditioned when I was 14 years old. I auditioned for Michael Mayer, Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater.","I've known since day one of working on 'Spring Awakening' - back in 1999 - that it was special.","I have loved 'Les Miz' for so long. It was the first Broadway show I'd ever done.","I was in choir in school. I kind of just did it. I already knew I wanted to sing. My music program in my school wasn't really great - people didn't really want to be part of the choir, they didn't want to do the plays and stuff like that. It definitely wasn't the cool thing to do.","Listen, if you were with me on a plane? I'm embarrassed for the people who sit next to me. I have such a regimen! I, like, pound on the face cream because your face will dry out, I get the stuff you put in your nose so no nose germs come in, I take elderberry for immunity, I wear a scarf.","I'm honored to be in a position to have young girls or performers look up to me.","I do have 14 tattoos, but I also do come home every single night and watch reality TV with my cat.","I love to cook so much. I like to cook everything. I really like to eat my food.","I'm Italian and we curse a lot when we talk.","I really felt like I finally made it. Having your first fake pregnancy rumor. It was really awesome. I feel like it's part of what happens in this business, but that's a real one. That's a cool one to get.","Growing up on stage, I was introduced to makeup at a young age and I will never forget the first time I tried on a L'Oreal Paris iconic lipstick - it was instant glamour and I've been hooked ever since.","My idea of heaven used to be relaxing at home with a cheese plate and champagne.","'Glee' has made me feel beautiful.","I have such a passion because I adore animals so much.","I need some me-time. I have to remember to rest, because I have a natural energy and I don't want to burn out.","Los Angeles has been good to me.","New York is who I am.","I love myself, the way I look, my body, but sometimes I can't help but feel insecure.","Britney Spears is definitely my favorite past Candie's girl; her campaigns were gorgeous.","It's just really important I think for fashion to be affordable, because everyone should have the opportunity to wear cute things and be happy and comfortable in what they are wearing. That's definitely how I like to shop and how I like to think about clothes and fashion.","I'm overjoyed and beyond honored to be a part of the L'Oreal Paris family. I'm such a fan of L'Oreal Paris not just for all of their amazing products, but for what they stand for.","Sarfati. That's my real last name. I don't use it a lot because I got 'Lea So-fatty,' 'Lea So-farty' at school.","I'm a really big animal lover.","I've always been proud of my body, my Jewish nose and all of that. Hollywood's Hollywood, but that's not going to change.","If you think that there are actually covers that we haven't done on 'Glee' that I could then put on an album... We've done everything! Pretty soon we're just going to have to start doing opera and stuff on the show."],"Lea Salonga":["I play video games a lot... I love to read... I enjoy spending time with my husband and daughter, who are my most favorite people in the world.","I want every Filipino woman empowered with information regarding all options available to her regarding family planning.","It's in your DNA to be a Filipino; how can you just turn your back on it?","Love your enemies... it's not always an easy tenet to live by... and I have more often than not been inclined to wish my enemies ill than well.","I think I will always be performing; I don't think I can take that away. Because I really just enjoy it. I like getting up to sing; I like the challenge of learning new material and singing it in front of an audience.","I don't think I would've been performing this long if I didn't love it sincerely to the degree that I do. It's not enough to like it. Dilettantes like things. Professionals love things and I consider myself a professional.","I took some voice lessons here and there as a teenager but nothing too serious. I started taking it more seriously when I was in Miss Saigon. I needed to improve my technique in order to survive doing that show as many time a week as I was doing it. It's not an easy show to sing, so I needed all the help I could get.","All the Disney Princess films are iconic and beautiful, so to have been a part of all that was really a wonderful part of my life. It's all fabulous, too, that I have a daughter that appreciates the whole Princess thing.","When I'm doing a one-on-one with somebody, I have to speak in a language that that person can understand, using a vocabulary that they instantly get, and I always have to feel my way around to figure that out. It's a lot of fun, and it's also really challenging - challenging in a different way from performing.","I have no inner monologue.","I just refuse to date actors. I've done that, and I don't want to do that anymore. It's just the stress of traveling and being away from each other so much.","I was 28, and my mom was living with me. I had to decide. You have to claim it; you can't ask permission. After a gig in Singapore, she went home, I went to New York on my own, I packed her stuff in boxes and sent it home. I don't think she liked me for a while for doing that. It was something I needed to do to carve out my own space.","I have a half-brother who is very, very, very gay, many cousins, best friends who are all members of the LGBT community, and for me to not say anything would be hypocritical. There is a lot of prejudice. People think it is abnormal. No, it's just another normal.","I think that if an audience is truly appreciative of a performance, they will show it. Sometimes though, there are little differences, and there are audiences that are very reserved even though they are enjoying the show.","I'm interested in just about anything that's right for my voice, and that's a good fit for my personality in the part as well. 'Evita' has always been a dream part for me, but it's really, really high to sing. I'd love to do Elphaba - heck, I'd even do Glinda. For me, I'd do anything to get into 'Wicked!'","When I was about 6, my cousin was very active in a Filipino repertory company, doing musicals and plays. Her aunt was one of the founders of the company, and she told my mom that there were these auditions for 'The King and I,' and that they needed kids. I auditioned, got in and the love affair started from there and just kept going.","I pride myself in the fact that in the six months tour of Cinderella, I didn't take one show off.","I can't be an ingenue forever, and I wouldn't want to be.","There are a lot of actors who wish there was a next play, a next musical. As an actor, I guess that's all I can wish for - the next role, the next opportunity.","I watch a lot of TV - 'Perfect Strangers,' 'Family Matters,' 'Who's the Boss?' - then I go over my notes in the script, lock it into my head and go to bed.","I was doing TV work, theatre work, and some film work in the Philippines when I left.","I was 17 when I auditioned for 'Miss Saigon.' I really grew up doing that show. I pretty much knew, almost a year into 'Miss Saigon,' that I was going to be a performer, that I was going to be singing and acting.","I'd love to do just straight theatre. I'd love to do film and television, too.","I seem to have a soft spot in my heart for Australia and Australian actors. After having worked with one in 'Cinderella' and a multitude of them in 'Cats,' I've wanted the opportunity to actually perform 'down under.'","The thing about World War II is that everyone knows about the concentration camps in Europe - in Nazi Germany and Poland and Auschwitz and the other camps - but, no one really talks about the camps that were here in the United States.","'Allegiance' is pretty much a book musical. You know, people talk and then they burst out into song.","In the modern operas that 'Miss Saigon' and 'Les Miz' are, nobody breaks out into song from conventional book dialogue. Everything is sung from beginning to end, including the recitative.","The nice thing about doing a pop opera - in the way that doing, say, 'Miss Saigon' or 'Les Miz' would be - is that, because the convention is set from the beginning that this is an opera and everything is sung, there is never that feeling of 'Why is this person bursting out into song?' because the whole thing is sung.","The thing about Sondheim is that it does get very cerebral. You do need a faculty with words and a love for the lyrics to not just pull it off, but to have an appreciation for it.","I would love to do some straight drama. A lot of times it's not up to the actor, it's up to the producer. It's up to the powers that be."],"Lea Seydoux":["I found it hard to express myself in the world. I was very shy. I'm still very shy. But also, when I was a child, I could get very... I had this violence... I still get angry. But I don't break things; I'm not hysterical.","In America, you don't have to be weak, you have to be strong.","In America it's good to show people you are fine, you're healthy, you're sporty, you're happy to do things, to live. And in France it's more like you don't have to show you have success.","In America, they are very respectful of your work. People are not judgmental. They like difference - to be different is a force. In France, you have to be like the girl next door.","Whether you're in a blockbuster or an art film, you have to be able to adapt.","Male directors always project their own desire of women - how they want a woman to dress, to do her hair. With a woman director, it's more a projection of herself.","It's true that French are not very sophisticated in the sense that they don't dress up for dinners. They are not like Americans, where they are always perfect - the girls are not very sporty; they don't take care of themselves as much as Americans, who always have very white teeth and are so fit.","It's a misogynistic world. It's because of what we ask of actresses. We ask them to be sensitive, fragile, desirable. And men? We ask them to be strong and virile.","I'm not as beautiful as a model.","I was putting forward too much of myself when I was singing.","Actually, I started to become an actress because I met someone who was just a friend and I found his life wonderful, I thought, Oh my god, you can travel, you're free, you can do what you want, you're the boss. And then I met an actor and I was in love with him.","Even in between takes, you emerge yourself. So you don't have a life for six months.","If I do too many takes, I'm too self-conscious. I think I'm better in first scenes.","When a director you admire says that he wants to work with you, it's always a compliment, very good for your ego.","I don't have any preconceived ideas of myself. I just take things as they come.","My proudest moment is when I'm part of a good film, when people are touched by it.","I'm not reading reviews and critics. I don't care. I guess I'm still a little on my own planet.","For me, cinema's like a language - everyone has their own form of it.","As an actor, it's up to you to show that you can do something else. For me, the interesting actors don't always go where you expect to find them.","There are no nail salons in Paris - it is very expensive to do a manicure. I sometimes get one done.","I would love to take more risks - have pink hair - but it doesn't look right on me.","I don't really wear makeup every day. I feel like being an actress - we wear a lot of makeup - but when I am not working, I need to let my face breathe and be very comfortable.","I don't like modernity. I don't have television or the Internet at home. The Internet scares me. I can't drive a car.","This is why I became an actress. So that people will take care of me. To be an actress is a refuge. You are taken everywhere, stay in wonderful hotels, everyone looks after you.","I see that people now recognize me in the street. But it doesn't change me in the depth of my being.","I think that I'm shy and I judge myself. But at the same time, I also have big contradictions. I can be sometimes sure of myself as well. I'm not always fragile and vulnerable. I can feel tough and strong.","I've always felt that Americans are very in the moment. There's not so much melancholia and mystery as there is in France. Everything must be understood. Everything must be analyzed.","I love being in the States because there's an emphasis on work. People are enthusiastic. They put heart into things.","Music was my first love, but it was difficult for me. It's something that I really love, but I didn't feel that I was so good at it. I can sing well, but I'm not a great singer. When I sing, I don't feel I'm expressing all the emotions.","I find it hard to be joyful on screen because I'm so tense.","I love challenge. I love to be afraid before a film, before acting. I think always I want to experience fear. I've become addicted to this feeling.","I see society as something dangerous, and you have to save yourself from the rules. I think acting is the way I save myself.","I like to learn things from other cultures. I'm curious. It's exciting to be in an unknown world, in a way.","I like a man who can respect a woman. When he's real attentive, I think that is very manly. To respect a woman is divine."],"Lea Thompson":["One of things I like about looking at pictures when you're young and also meeting back with old friends you haven't seen in a long time is, for me, it's a glimpse of who I was.","In my deepest parts of sadness, I'm always making a joke or being sarcastic.","I have to read something positive every single day. I have to have faith that the day is unfolding in a way that is going to be useful to somebody else... For me, living every day in gratitude has been profound for me.","'Howard The Duck' has a lot of fans, and usually when they come up to me, I just think they're the coolest. Because it takes a lot of strength, a lot of perseverance to love 'Howard the Duck.'","I don't like a class system. I don't like the idea of being in a different class than other people.","I always felt like my best years would be from 50 to 65 years old. I don't know why. It was a feeling I had even when I was really young.","My beauty secret is to try to keep my heart as open and happy as I can, because it really makes the sad lines on my face look better.","Cyndi Lauper's 'Time After Time' was a perfect song. It was so beautiful and so heartfelt. Her vocals were so amazing. And, for me, that was a song I went to when I was feeling sad and wanted to feel even sadder.","My mother told me to raise my kids with calculated neglect. They get their self-worth from doing what they can do and not having everything done for them.","It's hard not to want to strangle people when you work with them for four years.","'Caroline In The City' was such an interesting thing, because I'd never been on the set of a sitcom or even auditioned for a sitcom when they gave me that part.","'Red Dawn' was really the most fun I ever had making a movie, because I love Westerns, and I love the idea of being a tomboy, and riding horses and shooting guns.","'Howard the Duck!' That's a really interesting movie. I appreciate my career, because I've had a lot of very interesting ups and downs, and most people... That movie is such a famous flop. In a land of a lot of flops, it's kind of awesome to be in a really famous flop. I mean, it's kind of a poster child for flops.","I love really crappy carnivals, where you think the ride is going to break. There's something so seedy about them.","Of course, I'd like to produce and direct a blockbuster, but you gotta build up to that. So now I'm learning from a bunch of little movies. And it's more fun with smaller pictures. It's more creative.","One thing the futurists never get right, though, is that the extreme desire for polyester only lasted a brief period in the '70s!","'Red Dawn' was very resonant with a lot of people - they love that movie. I always thought it was a little hysterical.","I think it's really hard to understand the depths and the power of the love that someone has for their children unless you really have children.","The whole experience of doing a sitcom is... Telling jokes with such precision is really exciting, but it's also terrifying.","Usually, you don't really end up lifelong buddies with your co-stars.","And I definitely gravitate toward people who use laughter to pull themselves out of the abyss.","It's actually shocking to me how hard it's been to get back into the movie business.","So when my film career took off, I always felt like I was trying to play catch-up because I hadn't studied acting before. I didn't know how to manage money or my career. When I look back, I think I was a little bit shell-shocked.","Sitcoms are usually given short shrift by the acting profession, but it's quite an amazing job.","You're sexy when you're young. You've got it going on, and then you have your kids, and you give your whole life to your kids, and then they're kind of gone, and like, what do you do? You've got to fight to stay inspired, and you've got to fight to learn new things and stay young in your heart.","I'm not overweight, but I'm not in shape at all. I do not work out.","I hate when people don't hear the actual words out of your mouth or even the intent of it. They just hear something completely different.","I enjoy learning about the new technologies. I enjoy getting to know the new fans and dealing with them on their turf.","I had been a ballet dancer and never could make a living, and just being so excited that I got to, all of a sudden, live as an actor.","As you get older, you have to fix your insides, because your face naturally gets a little crabby-looking, so if you're thinking mean thoughts, you look doubly mean when you get older. You can't hide it.","I mostly played 'Pac-Man', but I played 'The Sims' with my kids when they were growing up.","I play a lot of 'Scrabble' with my brother online.","I'm always really excited to try something new in my profession that I haven't done yet.","Casual games are a great way to spend time when you get bored. It's hard to keep people off all their little games.","I was such a fan of Cyndi Lauper and her whole 'Girls Just Want to Have Fun' thing."],"Leah Busque":["Life is like the monkey bars: you have to let go to move forward. Once you make the decision to leap into entrepreneurship, be sure to loosen your grasp on old concepts so you can swing your way to new ones.","Surrounding yourself with people who are actively and enthusiastically working toward their best futures will keep you moving toward your own goals.","Entrepreneurs have a natural inclination to go it alone. While this do-it-yourself spirit can help you move forward, adding an element of collaboration into the mix can make you unstoppable.","Sprout's a really cool app for pregnant women. It shows you what your baby's development is in real time, so I find myself checking it quite often.","Some people revel in getting their hands dirty. These are the people that make startups grow wildly. People with hustle also tend to be much more agile - they're the water that goes around the rock. These are the people you want around when everything goes wrong. They're also the people you want beside you when everything goes right.","Hiring's tough. It's not just filtering through hundreds of applications and blocking out big chunks of your day for interviews - those are the simple parts. The difficult thing is the nagging feeling that, despite your best efforts, the perfect candidate will somehow fall through the cracks.","Learn to bet on yourself and have confidence in your own decisions. No one knows your business better than you.","Swapping out the nine-to-five for a more agile, independent working life brings with it one other huge benefit - a channel for self-actualization.","I've never thought of myself as a female engineer or founder or a woman in tech. I just think of myself as someone who's passionate.","The Gmail app is definitely the app I use the most. I am always running from meeting to meeting, so it keeps me up-to-date with everything going on. I actually e-mail more often from my iPhone than my laptop, so having a nicely designed e-mail app is really important.","People with highly transferable skills may be specialists in certain areas, but they're also incredible generalists - something businesses that want to grow need.","Traditional models of work only let us cross out the needs on the very bottom of the pyramid - basic sustenance. On the flipside, independent employment within the network of the new sharing economy addresses our needs for a sense of community and belonging, autonomy and respect, creativity and problem solving.","As a small business or startup, one of the factors you should always consider when looking at a potential partnership is the incremental potential reach. Note that wider reach doesn't always mean a better partnership opportunity. Instead of sheer scale, take a look at which communities your potential partner can open up for you.","I had the idea for TaskRabbit one night when my husband and I were getting ready for dinner.","The excitement of being a Task Rabbit is that you can create your own businesses and become an entrepreneur. We're creating jobs for people in this economy. Some of the Task Rabbits are cashing out at $5,000 per month.","All of our TaskRabbits go through a vetting process, which includes an online application, a video interview, a series of background checks, and then an online quiz that they have to pass before they're activated on the site.","From my background in travel at HotWire and Expedia, the metrics that TaskRabbit is seeing are more than double at what I saw at both those companies.","I'm an engineer turned entrepreneur who's passionate about connection.","TaskRabbit is really my first baby. So balancing the second child is something I've tackled, but I'm really passionate about what I do, and then I'm passionate about coming home and putting my baby to bed.","As a mom, you're so panicked and starved for time, you just need help.","I've had some very strong female role models, so I think that's an important thing.","I believe there's been a slippery slope of new companies that have formed in the name of on-demand services... that maybe aren't having as much of a focus as they should on the worker.","It seems like those of us who run a business can't go five minutes without encountering the term \"company culture.\" The phrase is always uttered with extreme adoration, yet the very concept seems as nebulous as it is elusive.","Since most startups operate at a break-neck pace, with a concept to prove or a product to launch within a rapidly shortening runway of financing, company culture often gets shoved aside. This is a big, big mistake: Nobody serious about their business should put culture in the corner.","Startups need to focus on building a foundation for their company culture early, and then they need to revisit it often. Every time a hire is made, a feature is launched, a Facebook status is updated, a press interview is given, a round of financing is raised, or a meeting is held, culture should be part of the decision-making process.","Beyond brand, culture can help drive your product itself by creating the conditions for the idea generation that is and will continue to be the lifeblood of any company.","I've always been fascinated by what you can learn from looking into your DNA.","I am definitely a keep-it-clean type of person when it comes to e-mail. My 'important' folder on the Gmail app is constantly clean. When a new e-mail comes in to my important folder, I immediately look at it and determine what action item comes with it. The action item may not get done until later, but at least I know it's coming.","There are plenty of things I wish I'd known when I decided to quit my position at IBM and work on the idea that later became TaskRabbit. Maybe that's why one of the things I cherish most about being a founder and CEO is the opportunity to offer advice to new entrepreneurs.","The TaskRabbit community provides thousands of individuals access to the kind of economy that puts them in charge of their own lives and income. TaskRabbit offers a new model of work, one that makes it possible for people to set their own schedules, establish their own rates, and use their talents and skills to earn a living on their own terms.","Corporate efficiency has led to a nasty trend of filtering resumes for keywords. This might save time, but it ensures that many of the best candidates will never make it to the interview.","Online transactions, once relegated to leaps of faith, have evolved into our status quo. We no longer ask ourselves whether or not it's wise to buy online. Instead, we ask whether or not it's wise to deal with a particular person, service provider, or business.","Whatever the future of social reputation online, I'm excited to dig in and help forge the path forward. Not only will embracing and enabling the growth of these reputation elements benefit my business, the consumer in me can barely control her excitement.","One of the cool things we're seeing at TaskRabbit is local tech and gaming startups hiring TaskRabbits to test their products and deliver immediate user feedback. As the founder of a tech startup, I can tell you that this type of focus group testing is paramount - and usually really pricey and difficult to coordinate."],"Leah LaBelle":["Work hard for what you want because it won't come to you without a fight. You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to. If somebody puts you down or criticizes you, just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive.","My life has been a blessing. I'm grateful for everything I do have and the places I'm going and the things I've seen.","I am really into color and bright clothing. When I'm wearing heels, I always like to throw some different colors into my outfit, so it doesn't match. That gives my look a retro and funky feel.","You decide the things that ultimately you do. You have choices in this world, and that's how I live.","I want to be on stage and perform and win Grammys and help out my family in Bulgaria, because they are struggling, and my mom and dad, too.","I think fame comes from actually doing something big with your career.","My #1 goal is to become a successful singer and share my gift with the world.","I grew up seeing my parents perform and sing, and I just always wanted to be singing, too. Music has always been my deepest passion and what I felt most connected to.","I love ballads. I'm not into fast songs. I love to put my heart and all of my feelings into a song.","I just love food, especially my mom's Bulgarian cooking. Taco Bell is my favorite fast food restaurant. I also love Italian food.","My favorite singer is Lauryn Hill - all time, hands down. She was my biggest inspiration growing up.","I love Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, Brandi, Sade, Nat King Cole. I like the Beatles. I listen to a lot of that.","I first started to sing when I started to talk. As soon as I could form words and sounds together, I was singing."],"Leah Pipes":["I love really epic films. I really like 'The Princess Bride,' 'Lord of the Rings.' I really like 'Star Wars.' I love 'Harry Potter.' I'm obsessed with 'Harry Potter.'","I've gotten a lot of good advice from my parents. Probably the best advice I've ever gotten from my mom is 'Let it go.'","I never really sat down and decided, 'And now this is what I'm going to do.' I just do it.","Neither my fiance nor I take ourselves too seriously, and we want our wedding to reflect our lightheartedness.","I have spent a decade of my life dating. I am thrilled about never going on another bad date for the rest of my life. I'm also so excited to learn and grow with the person I respect most in this world.","I had CNN on in my hotel room every day while we were filming the pilot for 'The Originals.'","'The Originals' is going to be an epic showdown of supernatural forces, and that was very evident in the pilot. I just wanted to be a part of that.","I hope people understand there is a world outside our life in this bubble and hope we can appreciate it and preserve it.","The problem with being an actress is there's a lot of rejection.","I thought I was a pretty decent soccer player. I'm not.","I first got involved in soccer when I was three years old. And I played until I was sixteen, so for thirteen years, and I love it.","I wear sweat pants; I look terrible all the time. I'm so vulnerable.","If I'm around a boy I have a crush on, I can't even talk most of the time.","Whatever comes my way, I appreciate and do my best at, and if it were to fade someday, I guess I would find something else. But I just don't plan the future, I guess."],"Leah Remini":["I've really come to realize you have to love yourself before you can expect someone else to.","I'm not a neat freak. I don't mind things being messy but I mind them being dirty. I just can't relax in a dirty environment. I like things organized.","The guy has to kill the spider and get the dead mouse outta the pool.","I believe that people should value family and value friendships and hold those things sacrosanct.","There's a lot of things that are good in Scientology, because I wouldn't have been in it. And that's the thing: a lot of people trivialize this thing, like, 'Oh, it's Xenu, and it's a volcano, and it's jumping on couches and acting crazy.' These people are victims. We've been victimized. We believed in something because it starts out very normal.","Nicole Kidman was an inspiration to me at the time I left the church. Knowing that she went on to have a successful and happy life, both personally and professionally, helped to give me confidence.","There was always pressure to make a Scientologist out of the people you were working with.","I've always had a show that went seven episodes or 13 episodes or whatever. And I've never had a show that's gone past a first season. It really is a lot of work.","I love men who know when to put their foot down and when not to.","I try to be a good person. I know what my downfalls are, so that's a good thing.","I envision Hollywood as a race, and some people simply drop off before their turn comes around. It's all about stamina - your ability to get back up and keep going even though everything is pointing at the odds not being in your favor.","I didn't want to raise my daughter in the church because from what I experienced and what I saw, the church becomes everything - your mother, your father, your everything. You are dependent on the church.","I always felt like I was kind of an outsider because I didn't have the right things. I didn't have a Cadillac. I didn't have, you know, plastic on my furniture. That was the right way to be if you were Italian.","My grandmother lived on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, and she used to go to church every day. She'd go in, light a candle, she'd pray, and as a child, that was comforting to me.","But inside, I'm going, 'Oh my God, is my zipper up? Do I have a booger in my nose?' That's my inner monologue.","Are you trying to give me a hint that I should drop it? I can lose the accent; I just have to really focus on what I'm saying. And I have to talk slowly.","Men stop trying after a while and get lazy.","There's a lot involved in going to the bathroom for women.","I applaud my mother now for getting me through that time and making me believe in myself.","Men have just come up to me and asked for my number right away. That doesn't work. You have to know somebody and have a conversation.","I love a man in a suit. Men should stay clothed, even if they have nice bodies.","I always was trying to make people laugh as a kid. I was a big fan of Carol Burnett and Gilda Radner. I watched them and I remember feeling as a child, when I heard the laughter they got, a little jealous that they made someone laugh like that.","I used to do skits for my mom... and I was always entertaining as a kid.","My actions and the things I say and do, I wonder if they have an effect on my daughter and the way she's going to be as a person. I just want her to be a good person.","I'm blessed to have a voice, and I'm going to use it.","In my house, it's family first - but I was spending most of my time at the church. So, I was saying 'family first,' but I wasn't showing that. I didn't like the message that sent my daughter.","When it mattered the most, my mother was there for me. It was the moment that erased all those days she wasn't there.","You have to learn to believe you deserve love. And I'm getting there. I'm starting to believe it.","I don't want to be known as this bitter, ex-Scientologist. I'm not trying to bash anybody, and I'm not trying to be controversial. I just want people to know the truth.","Oddly, moving to L.A. had nothing to do with me wanting to be an actress. My mother had a friend who was willing to take us in for a month until we could get on our feet. So we lived on her floor. It was pretty traumatic, but I found my strength through my mother in that time because she never once made us feel like we wouldn't be OK.","As a kid, I remember wondering why we lived in an apartment, not in a brownstone, and why we drove an LTD, not a Cadillac. Even now, I'm like that. If I'm on the 5th floor, I will wonder why I'm not on the 6th floor. But that was my drive. I was obsessed with my family having a better life.","What Scientology offers is a bigger game. You're part of an elite group saving the planet.","My mother was in Scientology my whole life. Most people don't know that we were raised in it - I didn't decide to get into it. I was brought into it by my mom.","There shouldn't be any kind of judgment towards somebody who has a belief system that is not yours.","Scientologists view children as spiritual beings.","Because Scientologists view children as spiritual beings, you're not treated as a kid, so you're given a lot of responsibility. Your ego becomes extremely inflated.","Being critical of Tom Cruise is being critical of Scientology itself. You are evil.","My family is not so different from the rest of America. I think people love to see that, 'Oh, just because she's on television and in Hollywood, I can still relate to her.'","This is what I love about people! You meet people outside of the business, they'll tell you the truth.","I don't want to be doing a show that's negative, that's filled with drama.","I have always been spiritual.","I was always religious. I was baptized as a Catholic. I got my daughter baptized as a Catholic.","I believe that people should be able to question things.","No one is going to tell me how I need to think. No one is going to tell me who I can, and cannot, talk to.","There's things you can say about me, but here's what you can't say about me: that I'm not being genuine.","I have a big mouth, and I have a temper, so that's not good for people. That's not good for executives.","I would do another talk show if it was the way that I wanted to do it. Like, you can't tell me what we're talking about, and I want to hear real stuff.","I'm a very by-the-book person.","When you get your show - that's what 'King of Queens' was for me. That was my part; that was my show - I was meant to have that part.","I loved 'King of Queens'... You can't spend that amount of time somewhere and not pick that as your favorite.","If you don't care about somebody, you don't even bother to fight with them."],"Leah Ward Sears":["We need to in this country begin again to raise civil discourse to another level. I mean, we shout and scream and yell and get very little accomplished, but you can disagree very much with the next guy and still be friends and acquaintances.","When I was growing up, so many of the important changes for African-Americans were being made in the United States Supreme Court and were being made by lawyers. I followed the court very intensely and wanted to do that for my life.","I've always been very interested in the struggle for human rights, not just here but abroad, and I wanted to be an inside player in that struggle. I wanted to make the laws reflect our ideals and ideas in this democracy that is America.","I had very supportive parents that made the way for me, even at a time when there were very few women - no women, really; maybe two or three women - and very few, fewer than that, African-American women heading in this direction, so there were very few people to look up to. You just had to have faith.","I don't think there is such a definition of a perfect family, but I do think that our marriages are in crisis. Our families are in crisis. And I think the African-American family is at one of the worst stages it's been at in a very long time in this country. Fatherlessness is rampant.","I'd like to see marriage count again among African-Americans and not just in the society in general.","I think people need to commit to one another before they commit to bringing children into the world because that's the optimum arrangement for children, not to take anything at all away from women who have to rear their children by themselves."],"Leander Paes":["If I have a reason to do something, and I have enough passion, I generally succeed.","I love taking challenges, as my name Leander means 'lion's heart.'","I've always had this hyper kinetic energy, so I don't really need much sleep at night.","I wanted to emulate my parents - Mum captained India in basketball, and Dad won a bronze in hockey in 1972 Olympics. My focus has always been to achieve excellence whether in the field of tennis, in the corporate field, in the art of acting or in motivating youngsters.","My audiences have given me lots of love as a tennis player. I hope they appreciate my passion for acting.","I believe India has multi-talented people, so I have also embarked on my journey as an actor. I don't need to be a celebrity, since tennis has already given fame to me.","Director of any film is very important, and an actor has to leave himself in his hands to mould.","When the headache persisted, I checked myself into an emergency room. When the doctor used the term 'brain tumour', I feared the worst. My whole world shrank around me.","I know, in India, specially in Bollywood and the sports fraternity, there is a lot of negative media attention on prominent public figures.","Age is just a number. When I started, I never worried about how long I was going to play. I had very specific goals, and that's what I really chased."],"Leandra Medine":["Sometimes I wear red lipstick - it makes me feel sophisticated.","When I'm wearing red lipstick, I'll never do anything with my eyes. And it's so easy - you just put on red lipstick, and your whole face just seems done.","I really love the category on the site called Brain Massage.","It seems inevitable, if unfair, that when a woman is vying for a prominent position in office, her outfit choices will be analyzed to a degree considerably higher than those of her male counterpart by simple existence of gender stereotypes.","People always ask me how I muster the strength to be so open about things, and I explain to them that I took the Myers-Briggs test, like, four times, and every single time, I ranked an 87 percent extrovert, so it would probably take more strength for me to shut up.","The holidays are only overwhelming because it's crunch time. It's like everyone trying to get last-minute things in before the New Year starts.","I don't take such good care of my skin; my mom kills me about it... I sit in the sun so much. I love a tan.","I love manicures - I'm really into colorful nails.","When you have a voice, you also have a moral obligation to use that voice for good.","I feel like alternative piercings in the ear is this untapped way to festoon yourself. Not many people understand this, but it hurts so good. It's like getting dental work done. It hurts in the right way.","My eyes will never be blue; my bone structure will never allow for you to mistake me for a Scandinavian model.","I think that when I started Man Repeller, the Internet was still hungry for authentic content from girls that weren't actresses or supermodels and were just relatable girls who had opinions and outfit ideas, and they weren't always good, but at least they were original.","I'm someone very comfortable airing out the stories of my own life. Some people call it narcissism, but for me, the intention is that it will positively affect other people.","As someone who has been known for the way they've been dressed, it's almost OK for me to wear New Balances and sweat pants. I'm not necessarily moulding trends, but it's OK if I'm not adhering to them.","I gained this new sense of control over my love life because when I called myself a 'man repeller,' you assumed that being single is my choice. I'm man-repelling because that's how I want to dress. I'm not single because no men like me. I'm single because I choose fashion over a relationship.","I haven't worn make-up since my wedding, and my husband loves me a lot.","I don't necessarily see my not wearing makeup as a social comment or that it's because I work in a female-dominated industry.","I don't say in the morning, 'Look, Leandra, here are a bunch of women. Put that bronzer down.' It's more that I'm busy and whatever helps you get out the door and go to sleep easier.","I'm really happy that people understand that man-repelling is a good thing. I was afraid people would think I was mocking fashion, and it's like, 'No, I swear, I'm wearing feathered sleeves as I write this!'","The men who really get repelled by what you're wearing are a little shallow, and you probably don't want to date them anyway.","I think the thing about New York City real estate is that you kind of just take what you can get when you're renting.","You don't usually find an island in a New York kitchen.","I do know that I would never - though you should never say never - work with a decorator, because I don't want to see the touch of someone else in my own space.","I'm not comfortable leaving the apartment if the bed isn't made or a chair isn't tucked into the table.","I got a C in art when I was in 11th grade. That it is even possible to come out of a high school art class with a C is wondrous, especially considering the creative license we were encouraged to use to, for lack of a better axiom, color outside the lines.","Making the decision to embrace or to shun makeup is one that should be contingent on nothing more, nothing less, than doing what makes you feel like the best version of yourself.","What a woman does or does not do to her face is personal. And as with most other things, makeup or a lack thereof can serve as either a prison or a fortress commanded by the mind: you can become a slave to it, or it can set you free.","Next time you look in the mirror, close your eyes and ask yourself when you feel like the best version of you. When you open them, act on that.","No matter the candidate, every detail in a campaign is carefully and strategically framed for our consumption. The devil is in them.","Fashion is used as a tool to convey a point about who we are or potentially want to be. Whether or not a civilian curates his or her own aesthetic is up that person, but it is an integral part of one's public image.","I do not wear a lot of makeup. On social media, this seems to work both in my favor and against me.","Don't get me wrong - I'm not against makeup. If I could manage looking like 'me' in a way that also read as tastefully, invisibly airbrushed, I'd sign up for that faster than you could choose a filter to do it for me.","One thing I didn't think upon getting married: that my style would - or could - change.","What good is a wall without framed art? It is like the equivalent of the accessories that you choose to wear to decorate a black dress - precisely the stuff that makes the wall/dress you.","There's charm, in some capacity, to every trend. I just think practicality should die. Crocs - blech.","I started my blog when I was a senior in college, and I knew that all the people in my program were probably going to be applying for very similar jobs, so I needed something to separate my resume.","I want Man Repeller to feel like you're waking up in the morning, you're calling your girlfriend, you don't know what she is going to say, you don't really care what she has to say, but you know you're going to like it, and you're going to laugh and hang up the phone and feel ready to take on the day with all this new knowledge.","I always wanted to make sure that I was honest to myself and that people wanted to hear an opinion that was authentic... I wanted Man Repeller to be a voice for women who felt like they didn't have a voice or for women who didn't know how to express their voice.","I have a degree in journalism, which is something that I make very clear very frequently just so people are aware of it. I went to school to write... Editorial integrity is very important to me.","I have always had a fleeting relationship with clothing.","You have to keep a feeling of goodness in your exteriors.","I never thought I'd wear Birkenstocks, but here I am! Having said that, I'm pretty sure I'd never wear Crocs.","I never borrowed money from Mom. I lived at home, but my parents never helped me. I worked hard and moved out. I treated my blog like a business; hard work is important.","I wanted to be my own editor, and by 'editor,' I mean unedited-or.","Man Repeller is intended to chronicle all the fashion trends that women love and men hate. I started it because I am woman with a deep appreciation for harem pants. And sometimes blaming clothing on a sad love life is easier than blaming oneself!","I'm probably most inspired by good street style that features items I already own; it's always great to see how another person wears something you have, which sort of reinvents it for you.","Nothing's worse than oily skin.","I am loving visible bras with shirts, high-waisted pants and oversize blazers.","If I were going to prom again, I would wear a huge skirt and plain cotton tank. A big, poofy, flotation-device-sized skirt. I wish I had done that.","I wore some stupid brocade dress to my prom.","When you're writing a blog post, you can take solace in knowing that you will immediately know how people will respond to it, and if the criticism is bad, then that's fine because you can work on that and fix it, and if it's good, then that's great because you know what to do in the future. It gets pushed down so quickly.","I always grew up with the idea that in order to be a successful writer, I should have a book published.","Sloane Crosley and David Sedaris are two of my favorite writers; they're the kind of writers who make you feel like, 'I can do this. I want to do this.'","Initially what defined me as a 'man repeller' was my conscious effort to wear clothing that was attractive in my opinion but not necessarily in a man's opinion.","I think men like things tight and simple.","I realized that if I were a 23-year-old girl getting married, and I wasn't struggling with it, that would likely mean that something was either massively wrong with me or that my brain is made up of delicately wrapped almonds that serve perfectly as party favors.","People often ask me if my parents helped me. My mother did lend me $10 to register the domain name.","I have always, always loved words.","Nothing feels better than constructing a beautiful sentence.","Women totally dress for women. If we were dressed for men, we'd be prancing around in tight, tight, tight bodycon skirts and tops all day or really simple jeans and T-shirts.","Our sartorial choices aren't that different from our psyches.","I'm not dressing with men in mind at all. I'm just going to wear what I want to wear. It makes things easier, too.","When I wake up, I put on what I'm in the mood to wear.","Part of what dressing for yourself means requires your understanding that the scrutiny of others is frankly irrelevant.","I have never done anything to my brows, though sometimes I tweeze the intersection of the left and right brow, which is either a really good thing or a really bad thing.","I'm Jewish, so I don't really do Christmas gifts, and Hanukkah is not as big a deal as gifts are concerned, so I never actually give gifts.","I understand that it's the thought that counts, but receiving money is so great, so if you're in a position to give an employee a bonus, just do that.","When push comes to shove, no one really cares what you're wearing except you.","If I have to give up good fashion for a relationship, I don't want a relationship.","My blog is not about repelling men, it's about good fashion.","Being a man repeller becomes a process of elimination. If a guy is only really into your outfit and won't date you because of what you're wearing, they are too driven by the female exterior and don't care about your intellect.","I knew I wanted to be a fashion writer but didn't want to contribute to the over-saturated market unless I could contribute in a meaningful way.","My goal is never to push anyone to do anything other than think.","I didn't actually even really know my grandmother; I must have been 3 or 4 when she died.","Without getting too spiritual, God has done so much for me; the least I can do is drink Kiddush wine on a Friday night.","Could Yosef be considered a Man Repeller even though he's a man? I'd love to get my hands on that techni-colored dream coat! Feels very Matthew Williamson to me.","Fashion Week is a great opportunity to make unimportant people feel like they own the world.","I don't hate what I see when I look in the mirror. Even if legions of others don't agree. I have accepted the reflection that reliably bounces back at me for its perks and its flaws.","I am comfortable with how I look.","I understand that there are thick, dark circles under my eyes. I have grown to appreciate them. I have noticed that my nose grows a little hookier on a near-monthly basis. That's fine. I know there are wrinkles ready to stake their claim as full time residents on my forehead any moment now. My dad has those, too, and I find that endearing.","I didn't launch the website with any goals in mind, to be honest. I didn't know that it would have been anything other than a digital portfolio once I graduated college.","I think Man Repeller is more about self-confidence than it is about a woman's relationship with a man.","Most people don't know this, but I never wanted Man Repeller to be about me. It was titled that to identify a genre of women.","I have such a simple process - it takes me, like, ten minutes to get ready.","I buy all my perfumes duty free - I think people are fools not to.","By the time I graduated college, I was sick of what was out there. I wanted to bring something new to the Internet.","You're not stupid because you're interested in fashion, period.","I have a pretty decent understanding of which posts will perform better than others. Specifically on Instagram, when it's a style picture, those ones always get way more likes.","That's what I always wanted Man Repeller to do - to change the way people actually think. Showing young girls that there are no rules.","Especially with Instagram, I feel reluctant to make all the photos beautiful because I don't necessarily want to send this message that life is perfect and your avocado toast is always going to be beautifully lit. I want readers to feel like the Man Repeller page is real and kind of dirty. Messy.","Your doubts are generated by fear, and fear is a series of distorted thoughts.","I can't imagine catering to an audience that doesn't also interest me.","I think, fundamentally, Man Repeller is a voice for women to connect with; they can come and try it on for size and be a part of it, and if it works for them, they take it with them.","As long as you are promoting something that you really believe in - yes, it's incredible to see that designer earn the esteem they deserve - but there's something to be said about the fact that if you're convicted about an opinion, and you really believe something's great, you're not going to credit yourself for their success.","Most people assume that my style is so outlandish and out there, but the reality is I like very classic pieces just rendered unusually.","The number one thing I would say to someone who wants to start a business is if you really can't sleep at night and smack the passion out of yourself, then go for it, but if you can live a happy life working for someone else, do that.","Running a business is incredibly hard, especially as a creative person, because you're extricated from the creative very quickly, and that is really hard. Obviously, I have experienced that first hand.","Nighttime dressing is not very different from daytime dressing for me. I feel like night clothes don't get a chance to live the way day clothes do, so I prefer to think of night clothes as day clothes."],"Leanne Caret":["With Liquid Robotics' innovative technology and Boeing's leading intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance solutions, we are helping our customers address maritime challenges in ways that make existing platforms smarter, missions safer, and operations more efficient.","I'm all for competition; competition is good. I just want to make sure the playing field is level.","God doesn't give you more than you can handle.","My parents have provided guidance, objective feedback, and unconditional support. They are advocates of what I do.","Always take the high road. You never sacrifice your team. You sacrifice yourself for your team.","A lot of folks I mentor ask me, 'How did you get there?' I tell them, you never plan on it. Do a good job and treat customers well, do the right things for the right reasons. Prepare yourself, but don't spend all your time worrying about it. Just do your job, and you'll be recognized for it.","Boeing is always looking at innovative ways to offer customers the highest level of service and support.","We need to understand where our issues and challenges are and confront them head on. Because you can fix anything if you know there's a problem.","Without our customers, we don't have a business.","I was born outside Kennedy Space Center.","I'll say this: I'm not so sure 'The Jetsons' had it so wrong.","I'm very much a realist.","We need to stop defining Boeing's future based on a single program or two programs, and we have been doing that with the fighter story. It doesn't mean it was wrong or right; I just don't think it represents the great diversity of the Boeing Defense portfolio."],"Learned Hand":["Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it.","In the end it is worse to suppress dissent than to run the risk of heresy.","Life is made up of a series of judgments on insufficient data, and if we waited to run down all our doubts, it would flow past us.","Right knows no boundaries, and justice no frontiers; the brotherhood of man is not a domestic institution.","The mid-day sun is too much for most eyes; one is dazzled even with its reflection. Be careful that too broad and high an aim does not paralyze your effort and clog your springs of action.","Words are not pebbles in alien juxtaposition.","You cannot raise the standard against oppression, or leap into the breach to relieve injustice, and still keep an open mind to every disconcerting fact, or an open ear to the cold voice of doubt.","Life is made up of constant calls to action, and we seldom have time for more than hastily contrived answers.","It lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it. While it lies there, it needs no constitution, no law, no court to save it.","What to an outsider will be no more than the vigorous presentation of a conviction, to an employee may be the manifestation of a determination which it is not safe to thwart.","If we are to keep democracy, there must be a commandment: Thou shalt not ration justice.","A self-made man may prefer a self-made name.","No doubt one may quote history to support any cause, as the devil quotes scripture.","We may win when we lose, if we have done what we can; for by so doing we have made real at least some part of that finished product in whose fabrication we are most concerned: ourselves.","Words are chameleons, which reflect the color of their environment.","Thou shalt not ration justice.","I shall ask no more than that you agree with Dean Inge that even though counting heads is not an ideal way to govern, at least it is better than breaking them.","The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right.","The aim of law is the maximum gratification of the nervous system of man.","The art of publicity is a black art; but it has come to stay, and every year adds to its potency.","It is enough that we set out to mold the motley stuff of life into some form of our own choosing; when we do, the performance is itself the wage."],"Lech Walesa":["I use many different gadgets connected with computers; I use PCs, laptops and a Palm Pilot. I also use the Internet to visit websites, especially within Polish-language Internet. I usually go to political discussion groups and sites - of course, as I use my real name, people never believe that they are chatting with me!","It is hardly possible to build anything if frustration, bitterness and a mood of helplessness prevail.","There is something of the warrior in me.","Obviously people want social calm, but if you do not let clever and ingenious people to participate, obviously there must be some dormant volcano that will erupt, sooner or later.","When I was fighting communism, there was rapid development of satellite television and cell phones, and communism, to survive, would have to block all these information devices.","My most ardent desire is that my country will recapture its historic opportunity for a peaceful evolution and that Poland will prove to the world that even the most complex situations can be solved by a dialogue and not by force.","The sole and basic source of our strength is the solidarity of workers, peasants and the intelligentsia, the solidarity of the nation, the solidarity of people who seek to live in dignity, truth, and in harmony with their conscience.","I'm lazy. But it's the lazy people who invented the wheel and the bicycle because they didn't like walking or carrying things.","Authority must be respected and chosen wisely.","The fall of the Berlin Wall makes for nice pictures. But it all started in the shipyards.","The thing that lies at the foundation of positive change, the way I see it, is service to a fellow human being.","We hold our heads high, despite the price we have paid, because freedom is priceless.","My youth passed at the time of the country's reconstruction from the ruins and ashes of the war in which my nation never bowed to the enemy paying the highest price in the struggle.","This conviction brought me, in the summer of 1978, to the Free Trade Unions - formed by a group of courageous and dedicated people who came out in the defense of the workers' rights and dignity.","The people in Poland had to deal with painful reforms.","My country is in the grips of a major economic crisis. This is causing dramatic consequences for the very existence of Polish families. A permanent economic crisis in Poland may also have serious repercussions for Europe. Thus, Poland ought to be helped and deserves help.","I most sincerely wish that the world in which we live be free from the threat of a nuclear holocaust and from the ruinous arms race. It is my cherished desire that peace be not separated from freedom which is the right of every nation. This I desire and for this I pray.","He who puts out his hand to stop the wheel of history will have his fingers crushed.","When I recall my own path of life I cannot but speak of the violence, hatred and lies. A lesson drawn from such experiences, however, was that we can effectively oppose violence only if we ourselves do not resort to it.","The politicians always told us that the Cold War stand-off could only change by way of nuclear war. None of them believed that such systemic change was possible.","The supply of words in the world market is plentiful but the demand is falling. Let deeds follow words now.","The hope of the nation which throughout the nineteenth century had not for a moment reconciled itself with the loss of independence, and fighting for its own freedom, fought at the same time for the freedom of other nations.","As a nation we have the right to decide our own affairs, to mould our own future. This does not pose any danger to anybody. Our nation is fully aware of the responsibility for its own fate in the complicated situation of the contemporary world.","I want to light the lights of patriotism.","No minority should climb all over the majority.","I'm a man of faith. I only fear God, and my wife - sometimes.","Poles finished communism, and Great Britain profited significantly from this.","Our national history has so often filled us with bitterness and the feeling of helplessness.","I belong to the generation of workers who, born in the villages and hamlets of rural Poland, had the opportunity to acquire education and find employment in industry, becoming in the course conscious of their rights and importance in society.","Lying at the root of the social agreements of 1980 are the courage, sense of responsibility, and the solidarity of the working people. Both sides have then recognized that an accord must be reached if bloodshed is to be prevented.","What until then seemed impossible to achieve has become a fact of life. We have won the right to association in trade unions independent from the authorities, founded and shaped by the working people themselves.","Let the veil of silence fall presently over what happened afterwards. Silence, too, can speak out.","The defense of our rights and our dignity, as well as efforts never to let ourselves to be overcome by the feeling of hatred - this is the road we have chosen.","I realize that the strivings of the Polish people gave rise, and still do so, to the feelings of understanding and solidarity all over the world.","I got politics and economics moving and then others took over.","I have always been and will be an enemy of communism, but I love all people.","I made the right decisions, I set everything on the right course, the reforms are going in the right direction.","I decided to get to know my opponents and their arguments.","I am happy that Poland is returning to the road of pluralism and democracy.","I cannot stand for more than half an hour in one place.","Freedom must be gained step by step, slowly. Freedom is a food which must be carefully administered when people are too hungry for it.","People always ask me, 'Lech, aren't you afraid of being killed?' And as an answer I shrug my shoulders.","Now is the era of intellect, information and the Internet.","Democracy is made up of three elements. One is whether the laws support pluralistic principles. The second is whether the people take advantage of these laws. The third element is whether the peoples' wallets are thick enough to benefit from this democracy.","Dictators and oppressors should continue to fear me because I will be here for a long time.","We were hoping Obama would reclaim moral leadership for America. That failed.","We need to agree on common values for all religions as soon as possible, a kind of secular Ten Commandments on which we will build the world of tomorrow.","Communism is a monopolistic system, economically and politically.","I must tell you that the supply of words on the world market is plentiful, but the demand is falling.","You have riches and freedom here but I feel no sense of faith or direction. You have so many computers, why don't you use them in the search for love?","I belong to a nation which over the past centuries has experienced many hardships and reverses. The world reacted with silence or with mere sympathy when Polish frontiers were crossed by invading armies and the sovereign state had to succumb to brutal force.","Our firm conviction that ours is a just cause and that we must find a peaceful way to attain our goals gave us the strength and the awareness of the limits beyond which we must not go.","The program of our movement stems from the fundamental moral laws and order.","We shall not yield to violence. We shall not be deprived of union freedoms. We shall never agree with sending people to prison for their convictions.","One could always do more, faster and cleverer, but democracy has its own rhythm.","I had my own battle tactics.","I allowed myself to be taken in by the intellectuals. I believed too much in the Polish intellectuals and followed their advice.","You should go to the polls, organize yourself. But once lawmakers are chosen, they must be respected.","Capitalism is in crisis.","I have more than 100 honorary Ph.D.s.","I will talk and act, not on my knees, but with prudence.","I represent the concept that pluralism is essential, union pluralism. I made an oath about this.","I am no politician.","In myself I am nothing. It all comes from God and the Virgin Mary.","I'm a fatalist.","I have a vision, and I know I'm right.","Communists are great capitalists, so there is no threat anymore.","People are most important.","For now, capitalism is working to produce more money but does not see the people. This problem is getting worse across the world.","I don't like to look a man in the eye.","I believe that any violation of privacy is nothing good.","I risked my life.","I am overjoyed that I do not need a heart transplant at this time.","My health is very much improved.","I hope to work harder than ever to help people around the world.","I can't imagine the right wing trying to unite without my participation.","We have travelled so far in our technical advancements that we are no longer located in our own countries.","After the war, Germany fully confessed to all its dirty tricks. It's necessary to is draw a line under the past, even if people did something evil. Until we do, wounds won't heal.","I don't have regrets I didn't spend more time with my family because I've lived my life to the full, and you can't look back in regret.","My struggle led to the reunification of Germany and the creation of the state of Europe. We destroyed the borders; globalisation is on the horizon.","Tomorrow there will be no division to Europe and Asia. These are old concepts that would remain only on maps. Everything will be united. Companies will be united. It is a process of structures growing due to the technological progress.","Life creates new heroes, and new heroes always find it easiest to beat up on the previous heroes.","My character and personality is today and tomorrow; I do not work well remembering further back.","Up to the 20th century, we can say that this whole period was an Earth epoch, 'Earth' meaning the riches of the earth, simple physical work. That is why there were wars, the movement of frontiers, war over riches.","Communism is a monopolistic system, economically and politically. The system suppresses individual initiative, and the 21st century is all about individualism and freedom. The development of technology supported these directions.","Technology helped end communism by bringing in information from the outside.","Communism in Cuba will collapse sooner or later because you can't control the free flow of information. Communism prevents organizations from developing by stopping the flow of information. The system is based on police and listening devices and triggers the worst characteristics in humans."],"Lecy Goranson":["I was living in Evanston, Illinois and I was taking theater classes down the street, and our theater school was kind of affiliated with an agency, and so I went on one audition for whatever that movie was, 'My Stepmother is an Alien' or whatever it was, and 'Roseanne' was my second audition.","I'm a big Ralph Lauren girl, but I love vintage clothing. I like the whole western jeans and boots style. I love vintage T-shirts and flannels, and there's nothing like a great vintage sweatshirt.","There was a period when I really had to ask myself, 'What does acting mean to me?' I'm not someone who's content being famous, with that whole lifestyle. I had to realize I could find a balance between what I like to do and what people think you're 'supposed' to do as an actress.","There's nothing like watching Dr. Oz and working out at the same time; you feel like you're the healthiest human being on the planet."],"Ledisi":["I'm not focused on radio or whether I'm going to get all the audiences... all I wanted were great songs that were universal to any listener - Black, White, Green, Yellow; any kind a age difference.","When my time ends, I want people to say, 'Man her music made me smile; it just enlightened my life; it inspired me; it made me feel good every time.'","I know who I am and I've always been comfortable in my own skin.","I love opera so much. I would never go back to doing it, but I love to listen - I'm grateful for it.","Whether I do jazz or R&B, there are always complaints. I would just listen to the complaints about what I do instead of celebrating what I do, and that I'm different and in my own lane. It took a while for me to just ignore the doubts."],"Lee Ann Womack":["I'm a businesswoman. I am a music lover. I like for people to like my music. When you listen to top 40 radio, you hear pop stuff. You hear rock stuff. You hear all these different influences.","I've learned the lesson that when you're in the middle of something that seems overwhelming, or you're in a bad situation and it seems like it's the end of the world or whatever, then you learn that it's not.","But I'm also a music lover, and I'll always try a lot of different things.","And I also have a camera, a Web cam, and I have one at home, so I can hook up and talk to the girls, and they can see me while we're on the bus in the middle of nowhere.","When you really are country, and you don't just wear it like a piece of clothing or something, you really can't get away from it. It just is who you are.","I don't sing country music because I'm not capable of singing other kinds of music; I sing it because I think it's the most beautiful kind of music there is.","And to me, I had come out of Texas, and during that time was when I realized that a lot of people in Nashville, their idea of what country music was was not the same as mine.","I came to town thinking that everybody had the same idea of what country music was that I did.","And it took me about 11 years to get a record deal, and I just had to work around and come to terms with the fact that what I was doing was going to be different, and I just had to wait until somebody was ready to jump on the bandwagon.","So it's more the musician in me that makes me stretch out and try different things more than anything. But, like a lot of guitar players, I have one certain niche that's my thing that I'm better at than the others.","I think a lot of it had to do with, you know, I was always a daddy's girl. I was always wanting to please him, and I think he was pleased when he'd walk past my room and I was listening to those records.","You know, you want everything you do, obviously, to be a success critically and commercially. But what you find out as you go along is that everything won't.","And I hate to see artists who are real safe. I love to see artists swing for the fences sometimes.","But I just love that music scene so much, and I enjoy really being around those artists and watching them even more than I do performing, because they are a whole group of people that do it because they love music.","And for the past 10 years I've been in a real commercial setting where people are all about numbers, they're all about that bottom line. So it's nice to step out of that and hang out with a bunch of people who play music just because they love it, as you can imagine.","The satisfaction that I get from doing what I do is not what I thought. I thought it would be that I'd feel like a star, I'd feel important. But I don't.","The satisfaction comes because you work hard and it pays off. It is not as glamorous as I thought it would be, but, you know, I appreciate it more than I ever knew I would, and I love it more than I ever knew I would.","Having that amount of nominations makes me a little nervous, because you feel that the bar is really high, the expectations are really high, but it also feels great.","Nominations come and go. It is not going to happen to you every year, and I am very well aware of that.","I want to reach as many people as I can.","I can see me continuing to make the best music I can, and let the chips fall where they may.","A lot of times in this business, we are taking advantage of hot times in our career to do a lot of TV and a lot of radio and that sort of thing, and George is able to be so humble that he can get away with not doing those things.","I think it is very important in this business to be an individual.","I think you can have moderate success by copying something else, but if you really want to knock it out of the park, you have to do something different and take chances.","With this album, I tried not to think too much. If I heard a song that I loved, I promised myself I wouldn't over-think it. If I loved it and if I wanted to cut it, I would.","I don't go out that much anymore, unfortunately. I used to enjoy it, but I'm just so busy. Like last night, everybody else went out, and I just went straight home and went to bed.","So you do shorter versions of the hits, or you take out a long guitar solo or things like that to make time for the hits and new music as well. But I don't think any of us ever get to do as much new music as we would like to.","I'm the most low-maintenance person on the road.","I love my little Mac G4 computer and we just had Internet installed on the bus... we all have little Macs actually, there's four of us on the bus, and we all just sit there and surf the Internet!","It's hard either way, at home or on the bus, I think the hardest thing probably for me is going one second from being mom to right out on the stage and having to be that person too. It's hard to switch gears.","Well, probably having to be away from home. When I come back I kind of feel like there's a routine going on that I'm not a part of, so that can be difficult."],"Lee Atwater":["My childhood, adolescence and high school days are unusually important. If there has ever been a time that I developed a uniqueness and sense of humor and the ability to organize, it was then. In those early days, I developed the skills that gave me a certain degree of success in American politics.","Perception is reality.","Mostly I am sorry for the way I thought of other people. Like a good general, I had treated everyone who wasn't with me as against me.","My illness has taught me something about the nature of humanity, love, brotherhood and relationships that I never understood, and probably never would have. So, from that standpoint, there is some truth and good in everything.","Just keep stirring the pot, you never know what will come up.","It took a deadly illness to put me eye to eye with that truth, but it is a truth that the country, caught up in its ruthless ambitions and moral decay, can learn on my dime.","I don't know who will lead us through the '90s, but they must be made to speak to this spiritual vacuum at the heart of American society, this tumor of the soul.","I think I learned pretty early that in the end, it's only you. To an extent, you're all alone.","Most of the time I was in grammar school through high school, I was in some kind of rock n' roll band. I would say that at least 80 percent of my energy was involved with whatever band I was involved in."],"Lee Bermejo":["When I was a kid, like four or five years old, I was obsessed with the 'Batman' TV show in the '60s. And I took it totally seriously. At that age, I took it completely seriously. I didn't get the fact that it was kind of played for laughs. I didn't understand why my mom was rolling her eyes or chuckling.","I've wanted to write ever since I've gotten into comics. I wrote little things for myself when I was doing mini-comics and things, before becoming a professional. But I just figure at some point or another, I've got to make the leap. I just have to do it.","I'm definitely not a monthly guy. Probably never will be. I'm simply in awe of the guys who do monthly books well... hell, in awe of people who do monthlies period.","As much as I enjoy seeing other guys do the superhero approach to the Batman universe, personally my own vision falls a bit left of center.","Who doesn't want to draw Batman or Superman? Everyone would like to be able to draw them. I've been really lucky when it comes to the characters that I get to illustrate.","'Joker' was a violent, dark, and brutal book, so I wanted to do something a little less heavy. I played around with the idea of a children's book, and that eventually became 'Noel.' And I just kept finding these parallels between things I could do with Batman and Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol.'","I just like a dirty, crumbling city. The Gotham I imagine is enticing and horrifying at the same time.","Color is definitely an important factor for me during all phases of producing a cover. I always start out with a loose idea of what I want to see when I'm doing my initial sketches. This choice can be informed by anything, but I usually tend to lean toward more simple color schemes... something with a very obvious push between warms and cools.","Since I'm so slow, I have to be fairly choosy about the projects I take on, and it can't be something that I'm only 'sort of' into. I knew that 'The Stand' would be an amazing challenge every month that would be a blast to illustrate.","Generally, when it comes to covers, I try and add elements that may not take your immediate attention but really become important the more you look at them.","I think you have to be crazy not to want to work on the Joker! I can't think of many characters, heroes or villains, that are as malleable as him. He really can be interpreted in so many different ways, and generally, people don't really want to scratch the surface because you can get into some really dark territory real fast.","I think that comics can do things movies can't and vice versa. In my opinion, you only expose their weaknesses if you try too hard at making one exactly like the other.","I do feel like 'The Dark Knight' is a great film, but that Batman in there? He's almost like Robocop to me. He's almost robotic looking; he's got this surgical approach to everything... He's almost not human. That's supposed to be his whole point: he's supposed to be the most human of superheroes."],"Lee Brice":["When you go to Nashville and start co-writing, you start doing it as a job and the more you do it the better you get. You know if you build houses for 30 years you're better than you were the day you started. You know the ins and outs, you know all the nuances.","Willie Nelson is not just a star or a headliner, he's a legend.","Every day you can write a song but some days there is just some magic in the air and something special about the catch; other days you write all day on a song line or idea.","Well you know, I've been into music my whole life, so to be able to put an album together with some of that music was awesome.","Well, you know I grew up wanting to be a Clemson Tiger and I ended up being able to play there and I went to school there.","It's a big plethora of music floating around in my head all the time, and I'll sit there and write a song.","When I get to go play in my hometown, it's almost one of the toughest times because I got so many people to cater to and then a lot of people that think they're supposed to be catered to.","The truth is, I think country music... there's a lot of great people, and just being raised the way a lot of country boys and girls are, hopefully there's just a lot of respect."],"Lee Byung-hun":["I was a fan of westerns growing up. Every boy wanted to ride a horse and be a cowboy.","I had no idea what it took to be an actor. Then all of a sudden I found myself cast in a TV drama. The director was very harsh with me. One time, he told me this would be my first and last acting job. I seriously thought that acting was not the right career for me.","The more I act, the harder it gets, since I feel like I still have so much to learn. Whenever I embark on a new project, it always feels like the first time. If it were easy to me and I felt like I knew everything, my acting might have been different. I think the feeling of 'newness' keeps me on my toes and concentrated.","I lead a very active lifestyle. When I am not working, I enjoy snowboarding in winter. I golf and swim in the summer months. However, trying to find the time to exercise when I am traveling is quite a challenge. I find myself working out at hotel gyms quite regularly - just so that I can keep up with my training.","In Korea, I do different kinds of genres. So, like that, I would like to do a lot of good acting films.","Actors always want to play the villain role at least once in their life.","Hollywood has a longer pre-production period and they juggle shooting schedules more carefully for each cast. In Korea, we shoot day and night without much break.","New Orleans has a lot of good food.","For 'The Rise of Cobra,' I was dieting more and using protein powder to help supplement my meals. For 'Retaliation,' however, I opted for more natural protein. I had a chicken breast and broccoli meal about five times every day. I also drank plenty of water and made sure I got enough rest.","Having - and keeping to - a regular exercise routine is crucial. And forget about those extreme diets - they aren't healthy.","G.I. Joe is not shown in Korea at all, basically, so a lot of people didn't know about G.I. Joe and I also didn't have the information about G.I. Joe.","Just like other ordinary people, I want to have a happy family.","Whenever I open a movie, I go secretly to the theater and stand in the back and enjoy the moment. I laugh when people laugh, and when people cry, I laugh.","I'm really close to Stephen Sommers. He was a really nice man.","Some people cheer me on. Some people want me to do more Korean movies or TV series.","When I was a young kid, my father was a big fan of Hollywood movies. He would make me watch movies with him, and he would explain the story and characters to me.","Sometimes people know I am an actor but are not really sure what I have been in.","My dream role would be to play a Korean hero in a Hollywood superhero movie.","I find myself working out at hotel gyms quite regularly - just so that I can keep up with my training.","The two moments that I felt the most nervous in my entire life were when I first had reading rehearsal for 'G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra' and when I was at the Academy Awards ceremony.","I have a special attachment to 'Bitter Sweet' and feel grateful because it introduced me to people in the film industry overseas and helped me experience Hollywood.","There are more crime films about the corruption of power because our society has similar problems. It would be great for me as an actor to work on an 'Inside Men' sequel, but I hope it never gets made. Because it would mean the corruption is still there.","I do not want to name any individual names, but I felt like when I was working in Hollywood, there were some fellow colleagues of mine who didn't even look me in the eyes because I was Asian.","It was great to be able to play a hero in 'The Magnificent Seven' in a film industry where Asian actors are often limited to playing a villain.","Having an interview in English is difficult for me, but acting in English is much harder. Because when I'm acting in English, if someone points out bad pronunciation or accent, I cannot focus on my emotions anymore, so it was very hard."],"Lee Child":["A calm environment is for after I finish work.","I have a kind of old-fashioned, artisan approach.","So long as readers keep reading and my publishers keep publishing, I plan to keep on writing. I'd have to be an idiot to be burnt-out in this job.","I love Italian food but that's too generic a term for what's available now: you have to narrow it down to Tuscan, Sicilian, and so on.","Practically any Western has a homesteader in trouble, and a mysterious rider shows up off the range, solves the problem over two or three days, and then rides off into the sunset.","I'm opposed to censorship of any kind, especially by government. But it's plain common sense that producers should target their product with some kind of sensitivity.","I have three desks. One empty for paperwork, one for the internet and email, and one for the writing computer.","I felt alienated by the experience and decided to stay away from corporate employment.","For men, as they get bogged down with responsibilities, commitments, bureaucracy, it is a fantasy just to think of shedding everything literally, walking away with nothing at all, and just hitting the road.","I don't need validation, recognition or praise. What I need are facts and the facts are that one of my books gets sold, somewhere in the world, every second.","I don't know what the secret is when I am writing it - it really is a surprise to me.","She's a reflection of my fascination with the diversity of America she's totally normal in New York, but a freak in Texas. There are dozens of such clashes in America.","You mustn't fall in love with your own hero.","There is nothing wrong with just telling the story.","I do a little fact checking now and then. Other than that its impact is simply that email has revolutionized communication for me, and my website has built up a community of readers, which is a lot of fun.","I had a brief theater background and loved the backstage world there's more backstage work in television, so I saw a job advertised and applied, and got it. That was back in 1977, when getting jobs was easy.","I had been coming to America very frequently for many, many years, so I had plenty of exposure - and maybe the best kind of exposure, because I think first impressions are very important. Maybe I notice stuff that is just subliminal to people who live here all the time.","I have the 'thing' worked out - the trick or the surprise or the pivotal fact. Then I just start somewhere and let the story work itself out.","I think my books come out very visual, which is an obvious consequence.","I wanted readers to be genuinely unsure as to whether she's telling the truth or lying. It meant making her partly sympathetic, and partly unsympathetic, which wasn't easy.","I was fired from my television job, simple as that. Well, downsized, really, a classic 1990s situation.","I write in the afternoon, from about 12 until 6 or 7. I use an upstairs room as my office. Once I get going I keep at it, and it usually takes about six months from the first blank screen until 'The End.'","It's a tough case and the first time Reacher needs to recruit somebody to help him out. He uses a woman he knew in the army she's a fascinating character.","So, how to stay inside the world of entertainment without actually getting another job? I felt the only logical answer was to become a novelist. So I wrote the first book - driven by some very real feelings of desperation - and it worked.","The British regulatory system was revised, so that bigger profits were encouraged, which removed the option of big spending on programming. Quality just fell off a cliff, and all the old hands either left or were fired for being too expensive.","What do I miss about the UK? Sadly, almost nothing. Maybe the midnight sun, in June in the north. That's all.","All of us write wish fulfillment.","I was in television drama, which is a first cousin to the movies, and I trust myself to make the right decisions.","I just felt from personal observation that there is nothing more dislocated or alienated than a lifelong military person trying to cope in civilian life. It's like two completely separate planets.","We would all love to walk up to someone and shoot them in the head, there's no doubt about that. We're too civilised to admit it, but we're happy to read about it.","The key to thrillers is vicarious pleasure.","I'd been a thriller reader all my life.","I've discovered writers by reading books left in airplane seats and weird hotels.","It's always tense when you move a character from a book to the screen. Always tense.","My mother still calls me Jim and that is about it. Everyone else calls me Lee. My wife calls me whatever.","I like food, like any other guy, but it is not the main thing in my life. I can do without it.","You know, women are as promiscuous as men and yet, of course, people are inhibited from having an affair or a relationship because the real-world consequences are a drag.","Yeah, I am pretty sure of myself.","I love visiting LA. It's an endlessly fascinating city, and is, of course, America's entertainment capital. Each time I go, I fall in love with it all over again. That said, it's not the sort of place I'd want to live.","I'm not really into gourmet food; I'm the kind of guy who just stops by a place that looks good rather than heading for the restaurant of the moment.","L.A. has a fantastic car scene and because the climate is so gentle, cars can last forever.","Male authors always take care to make their heroes at least one inch taller than they are, and considerably more muscular. Just as female authors give their heroines better hair and slimmer thighs.","The thriller is not a recent invention. It probably goes back to the dawn of storytelling.","I grew up in Birmingham, where they made useful things and made them well.","Writing is showbusiness for shy people. That's how I see it.","Most actors are small, anyway - at least compared to me.","We know we need civilization and laws and procedures, but isn't it frustrating? Wouldn't it be great if we could just do what we needed to do?","It's always sad if anybody you know has a personal problem.","In principle if I could not have a home I wouldn't. But not having a home would be too difficult procedurally, going from hotel to hotel, the gap of three hours where you're hungry and tired.","I need a stimulating environment to write because my books are driven at 100 miles per hour at a time.","The way to write a thriller is to ask a question at the beginning, and answer it at the end.","For me the end of a book is just as exciting as it is for a reader.","British crime stories tend to be very internal, psychological, claustrophobic, very limited in terms of geography."],"Lee Daniels":["When you have a lot of siblings, you always do something to feel special.","I'm not really vegan. I'm vegan-ish. I have a piece of lamb every now and then.","I believe in life that you know that everything prepares you for the next thing - whether it's a hit, whether it's not a hit, whether it's a... your failures are your accomplishments because it makes you prepared for whatever it is that you are going to do next.","Rarely do celebrities and actors speak up for what they believe in.","I think this last film I finished, 'The Butler,' is the closest I will come to as a work-for-hire.","I love actors, and I'm very protective of them. I trust them. It's a mutual trust.","Most actors want the audience to like them, and that leads to bad acting.","I'm always more comfortable and in a good place when I'm with friends because I know they trust me. I'm able to get great performances from people who trust me.","Putting on a movie is like going to war - for me, at least. It's all about time; time is money, and we don't have it. So it's all about getting to know each other intimately quickly. You are with family members that you like or don't like, but you can't leave them because you're stuck with them.","Every African-American I know has two faces. There's the face that we have for ourselves and the face we put on for white America for the places we have to get to.","I am so used to having two faces. A face that I had for black America and a face for white America. When Obama became president, I lost both faces. Now I only have one face.","When I make movies, I don't ever go out there to please anyone other than myself. I never try to make a film for the masses. I just try to tell my story.","I was always intrigued with European cinema, and hated most American cinema. I didn't like the one, two, three - boom! style, with a neat and tidy ending. That was never my scene.","When people don't like the film, I can take a bullet. I don't mind you talking about me, but I'm protective of my actors, because they bared their soul for me.","Stars make money on real movies. They make big money on real movies. To come into my world, I've got some M&Ms and some potato chips, and I'm asking you to move furniture.","I don't want to sell my soul to Hollywood - to just make run-of-the-mill stuff.","Here's the thing: I think the media underestimates the intelligence of the moviegoer. We need to be fulfilled. People want to sit down and think, and I try to make people think.","I don't know - I haven't seen any of my movies after I finish them. I leave the editing room; I don't go back.","I see the world from a very specific perspective. It is how I grew up. It is what I am proud of, and I vocalize it. And for those who have not experienced my experience, it is odd, and it's not mainstream.","I went from off-off Broadway. I would direct plays in Baldwin Hills. Almost Tyler Perry-like, really trying to express myself in that and not really knowing how to, knowing acting in story, but not really knowing how to technically hold a camera.","I don't work with fear, and I don't work with actors that are fearful.","To come into my world, I've got some M&Ms and some potato chips, and I'm asking you to move furniture. We're making a movie. We're making it like we're putting on a play.","I want to go to places that are unexpected of me because people really think they have me pegged.","I went back-to-back from 'Paperboy' to 'Butler,' literally with no break.","There are servers, and there are people that are served. There's something contradictory about that in a democracy, certainly.","I'm not going to be labeled a black filmmaker. I am not here to just tell black stories. I'm here to tell all kinds of stories, musicals and dramas.","I come from a family of domestics. I think most African-Americans of my age do. They were trusted by their bosses. I have met so many white people that spent more time with their nannies than they have with their own parents.","I don't know what gives me more pleasure: watching my story unfold or going in and watching a room full of black people talking for me and writing words for black people.","I hate white people writing for black people; it's so offensive. So we go out and look specifically for African-American voices.","I have a partner, Danny Strong; he's an incredible writer and, really, my backbone. So when we don't see eye to eye, it's painful.","I have a very clear vision, and I come from film, where director is God, so if there's a clash, it's painful.","I believe strongly that characters are five-dimensional, and they're complicated, and life is complicated, and people are complicated.","I like to show the grey area in all my characters.","I think it's very important that we don't sound like militants. Often what we do is we give a comment, and because it comes across with passion, then we're 'angry black people.'","With TV, you're in people's houses every night. And you have so much time to tell stories. I don't know why I didn't do it before.","My partner, Danny Strong, came to me with this idea of telling a story about my life and merging that with music and the hip-hop world. He wrote 'The Butler' and originally wanted to do 'Empire' also as a movie.","As a film director and as film actors, you get used to a certain rhythm that's slow. But with TV, it's hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. It's a different pace.","America is fickle. You never know what they're going to go for.","I've met Shonda Rhimes a few times, and certainly she's an inspiration for me in television.","I'm in a great place because I trust people behind the camera as I go off, and I still go back to my day job and do film.","Some of my friends don't have a cell phone. Patti LaBelle doesn't have a cell phone.","The ratings board is completely different when it comes to film versus the television arena.","I want to see movies I can walk away from and say, 'Wait, what happened there? Hold up, what did I just see? What?' and then it connects to something that you personally, unequivocally know to be truth.","I always question if somebody else is going to love my films. I think that's what art is about - it's so individual.","That's the gift 'Precious' has given me. You really think you're telling a story about a fat black girl, and only fat black girls will understand it, and then you realize we're all Precious.","If you really spend time with movies, it's three years of your life from beginning to end. I started out planting the seed with 'Monster's Ball' about independent cinema and raising money and that whole thing as a producer, and then it becomes easier for me.","I'm always workin', man. I gotta pay the light bills.","I had trained myself not to go to the bathroom throughout my elementary and junior high school years because I was bullied. And you don't understand why you're being bullied, so you just suppress it.","I want to live in my truth. Tell me you don't like me, and I know it. But when you don't tell me, and you work behind my back, it's a lie, and I don't know how to fight that.","At 19, I was in the streets making money. I was surviving.","I want to learn. I want to stretch my muscles as a director and work under different circumstances.","I'm a filmmaker. I'm always searching for the truth in everything I do. I demand it from my writing partner and my crew, actors, and so hopefully, we're making people think.","I wanted to make a black 'Dynasty.'","My kids tell me to Instagram, so I do that. I have a few thousand followers.","I was always in trouble. I was mischievous. And movies were always a part of my world.","My earliest experience was reading Edward Albee's 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' at 8, you know, with a bunch of kids on my steps - on the stoops - and knowing that I wanted to direct them saying the lines. I don't really know how to articulate that 'cause there wasn't someone to show me.","My dad was a cop. My mom worked at various jobs - she worked as a homemaker, a bank teller, a bartender.","Theater was always in the backdrop. Nursing was a way to pay the bills. I wasn't a nurse; I had a nursing agency.","I had 'Push' and 'The Paperboy' next to my bed for many years. Those are some of the great, great novels.","I look at my movies; I call my movies 'the kid.' It's like I'm giving birth. I'm in the cocoon, you know?","The rules are: The only ego is the film, and you have to serve the film.","I'm still pulled over... We were nominated for two Oscars for 'Monster's Ball,' and I almost didn't make the Oscars because I got pulled over in Beverly Hills.","'Precious' is so not P.C. What I learned from doing the film is that even though I am black, I'm prejudiced. I'm prejudiced against people who are darker than me.","When I was young, I went to a church where the lighter-skinned you were, the closer you sat to the altar.","'Shadowboxer' was based on my life.","I think that, as African-Americans, oftentimes we have to put ourselves on pedestals as opposed to really looking at ourselves and trying to understand ourselves and become better people. We always have to be on pedestals.","My work is therapeutic: 'Monster's Ball,' 'Woodsman' and 'Shadowboxer,' because I don't go to therapy, and I sort of live life through my films.","I don't know whether everybody likes the films that I do. I know that I love them, and I believe the way that I raise my kids that they will love them, and that's what most important to me.","I don't read the reviews, the blogs, or anything else. Instead, I feel the audience when I show the film.","It's hard for me to accept love. I wish I could lie to you and tell you that it's easy for me, but it's not.","I've had all types of beautiful girls tell me that they ugly when they look in the mirror, as if it's someone else's reflection they see.","I think the father-son love story is a universal one which transcends color.","I'm not Tyler Perry. I'm not Dino De Laurentis. I think it's a bit much to put one's name in front of the film. It makes me uncomfortable.","'Empire' was a very traumatic experience for me. It was very schizophrenic, and it wasn't what I expected it to be.","I've never done a studio movie, let alone worked for a network. Every one of my films has been independently financed.","I don't profess to be Shonda Rhimes by any stretch of the imagination, or Dick Wolf. They're icons. I'm a filmmaker.","I have twins that I didn't want to have the life that I had. I didn't have a great life growing up.","My mom had five kids. And she came home after working three jobs, and I'd rub her feet. We'd all rub her feet. We were lucky to get any time with her.","My mom knew early on that I was gay, and she knew that I had to get out of the ghetto.","Most of my friends are dead. I watched friends die in my arms at 5, 6, 8. When I grew up, the rest of my friends died of AIDS.","I drank from colored water fountains and from the white water fountain just to see what it was like when I was a kid. What shocks me is that these kids today don't realize that this happened in many of our lifetimes.","Most times when I do a film, it starts out with one idea and ends up not being what I thought it was going to be.","My mission is to let black kids know that their dreams can happen.","I love black women. I live for them. They are everything to me. I'm obsessed with them. They are sophisticated, resilient and smarter than me.","Some of the most provocative TV that I'm inspired by is in the U.K. You guys take it for granted, but in America, we can't do it.","I went to school at Radnor High School. And I went to a liberal arts college in St. Louis, Missouri, called Lindenwood College.","I thought I could write. So it was my intention to start off as a writer. But I wasn't really great at delivering the word at the end of the day.","I started casting. I cast music videos, but I kept getting fired from jobs because I was iconoclastic in my ways of casting.","I worked at Warner Bros. for a while. I was the head of the minority talent casting. It was like pre-Spike Lee and post-blaxploitation era.","I came to Hollywood to write and found out I don't have the attention span.","I moved on to a nursing agency as a receptionist just to get a job, and ended up managing it, which led to me opening my own - say your mom is sick and needs someone to help her, then you call something like what I had: a home health agency.","I didn't have the sensibilities of your ordinary filmmaker, let alone your ordinary African-American filmmaker. My heroes were John Waters, Pedro Almodovar, and actors that were part of that world.","I knew that I'd end up directing because I'm so hands-on with my films.","People enjoy making fun of people who are famous; they love putting people down.","I come from a family of servants. My father's father was a servant, and my father's father's father was a slave.","I was the oldest of five children, each about a year apart, and my mother, bless her heart, had her hands full.","I definitely caught the acting bug, but that lasted for about two seconds when I found my way to L.A. and found that my talents were better suited behind the cameras.","In L.A., I was a talent manager for many years. I represented many African-American actors. After a while, I became disheartened over the shortage of roles for African Americans.","While I am not a musician, I love music. I have over 15,000 songs on my iPod. Everything from hard core rap to the soundtrack from the original 'Cinderella.'","'Push' had a story, 'The Paperboy' story you could just throw up in the air and shoot holes through the book because the story wasn't as strong. But I felt the characters were stronger in 'The Paperboy'; they were vivid.","What attracts me to material are characters that I know - characters that I know people don't know but I know - and bringing them to the screen. Spotlighting voices that have not been heard before on screen.","When you're paying everybody nothing, I mean, they have homes to pay for. And my movies are like putting on theater. Nicole Kidman is at craft services, and John Cusack is moving furniture; there are no egos. The only ego is the story."],"Lee De Forest":["Short waves will be generally used in the kitchen for roasting and baking, almost instantaneously.","To place a man in a multi-stage rocket and project him into the controlling gravitational field of the moon where the passengers can make scientific observations, perhaps land alive, and then return to earth - all that constitutes a wild dream worthy of Jules Verne.","While theoretically and technically television may be feasible, commercially and financially it is an impossibility."],"Lee DeWyze":["I'm not here to change the music world, but I'm definitely here to show what I can do and express myself through my music.","This is America - you're allowed to say and do what you want and what you say and do defines who you are as a person.","I overthink a lot of things.","When you go through life, when you go through different things, you take risks, you question yourself. I think everybody does, at some point in their life, question themselves.","I think I can connect with an audience because I know what it's like to be on the other side of it and I really remember all of that.","Food in Chicago is the best.","I think a big part of 'American Idol' that scares people and actually has, I'm sure, stopped people from trying out is the fact that you do have to do things that are necessarily not your genre.","I have a pretty wide range of musical tastes.","Working a job I love is mentally less stressful than punching in a clock everyday, but it's a lot busier.","Writing on the road is a passion of mine.","Some people take pictures; I write songs.","I love knowing that people are connecting to my lyrics, my music and me.","I will always appreciate 'American Idol,' and I never forget about where I come from.","I'd love to work with Sufjan Stevens. He so gets it. He's amazing.","When I was younger, I was afraid to be myself.","There are so many good venues in Chicago.","I like blue a lot, and greens. Earthy blues and greens.","Melodies are important. I always kind of pride myself on my melodies.","I don't like to have really any expectations for myself.","Doing charity work is always cool. It's always a good thing.","I have goals that I want to reach, but you can never plan what's going to happen next.","Winning 'American Idol' is awesome.","I'm not the guy that thinks I'm a perfect singer.","My music comes from my emotion, always.","I love performing.","Writing isn't everyone's favorite thing to do or what their thing is.","If you've ever lived in Chicago, anyone who has, they know what a winter in Chicago is like. To be going through a tough time here in the winter would be just be all the more worse.","I'm the first one to admit, I'm a pretty unorthodox guitar player.","I know who I am as an artist. I've always known who I am as an artist.","I know what it's like to be shoveling to pay bills. I know what it's like to not have a job.","When I meet the right girl I'll definitely have no hesitations to a relationship.","I love Soundgarden, I love Rage Against the Machine, Simon & Garfunkel.","I'm not interested in just putting out one hit.","Bagel in the morning is the ultimate breakfast for me; they're just good."],"Lee Grant":["I've been married to one Marxist and one Fascist, and neither one would take the garbage out.","I did my very first film with Kirk in Detective Story when he was the greatest, greatest star in the world. I fell in love with him, had a crush on him then.","A lot of very, very big stars were going down and not being seen or heard from again. Kirk took a huge chance in putting a blacklisted writer's name on the screen and somehow or other, he survived it, like he survives everything.","Every actor in the room honored Sidney for being there so many years before. And everybody was so moved to be at a place where history was being made again. It was tangible.","I am proud of Kirk. I think he drums to his own drummer in every way.","I don't think I fit the Marilyn Maxwell mode.","I know what you go through when you learn someone close to you has died.","It's a very good feeling to be around a man who thinks women are juicy.","Kirk is a man, and he loves it. He loves women.","My instinct was that it was Sidney's childhood in the Bahamas that gave him the fearlessness to fight racism. So this documentary was a kind of rounding out of what had begun in that scene in In the Heat of the Night.","People break down after a couple of hours. All the defenses go down, and there's a kind of communication that if I spent 20 years in a living room with one of these people, I would never, never know as much about them as I do in that one day.","This is our lives. The way to give it dignity is to tell the truth.","What goes on between a father and a son, which is usually such a private matter, is that they are able to be honest with each other, and be honest with me, as a director. It's just remarkable.","When I became a director, I wanted to convince a very reluctant Sidney into allowing me to go on the journey of his life. Sidney had gone ahead of every other African American actor.","You don't need a love scene to show love."],"Lee Greenwood":["When our forefathers put down roots in desolate places, the thing that allowed them to survive was that they had a faith to see them through the tough times.","It bothers me to know there is the possibility that I as a Christian would be not only an underdog, but that I would be trodden upon if I claimed that I was a Christian.","My grandparents knew it was important that I understood Christianity and the Bible. But they never took me to church; they sent me to church.","At their core, when things really matter, people see a need to turn to God for strength and protection.","My personality is that I'm a human being like everybody else, just a citizen and a blue collar guy.","I'm pretty much an open book.","The traditions of a nation are very important and the anthem written by Francis Scott Key in the early days of our nation should always be revered.","Historically, America has answered to a higher authority.","The Constitution of the United States allows us to change; I don't have a problem with that.","But if we get to the point where more people do not believe in a God than who do believe in God, we will have a hollow legal system - we will have something without heart.","Some people may believe that their conscience is enough to guide them not to lie, be deceitful or do the other things God has commanded us not to do. I disagree.","People who don't believe in God may have their own way of justifying some bad act they have committed.","But I believe there is a decay that is eroding America, and as a result, God begins to disappear from our society.","When you put your hand on the Bible, you are saying something much stronger than just telling your peers that you're going to tell the truth.","The papers reveal that in several key abortion cases, justices were keenly interested in the perceived public reaction to their rulings - indicating that courts can be influenced by public sentiment.","That's why I believe that we must never fail to affirm that we are indeed one nation under God."],"Lee Gutkind":["It is easy to make stuff up - and easy to dig up information and repeat it or report it to others. But to find a real life story with real people in real life situations is quite difficult and time-consuming. Yet, the rewards are worth the effort.","Creative non-fiction is such a liberating genre because it allows the non-fiction writer, whether he or she be journalist or essayist, to use all of the techniques of the fiction writer and all of the ideas, creative approaches, that fiction writers get a chance to use, but they have to use it in a true story.","Nonfiction means that our stories are as true and accurate as possible. Readers expect - demand - diligence.","This is the first lesson for writers - or anyone - who conducts interviews: If you want someone to talk, you've got to know how to listen. And good listening is a surprisingly active process. The interviewee is your focus of attention; you are there to hear what he says and thinks, exclusively.","I discovered that I, a writer of what is known as creative nonfiction, could do the research and bridge the gap in my books and lectures through true storytelling. This is not 'dumbing down' or writing for eighth graders. It is writing for readers across cultures, age barriers, social and political landscapes.","When I talk with my students, I introduce a process of work I call the three R's: First comes research, then real world exploration, and finally, and perhaps most important, a fact-checking review of all that has been written.","Years ago, I met once a week, 9 A.M. sharp, with a therapist whom I will call Dr. Mason. We would settle in well-worn chairs, Dr. Mason, a slender, balding middle-ager in blazer and striped tie, and me, an anxious academic in Levi's and tweeds.","As a child, I had no interest in science whatsoever - then I started writing and recognized how relevant it was. My first book about science and medicine captured the world of organ transplantation in 1989 from the points of view of all of the participants - scientists, surgeons, social workers, organ recipients and even donor families.","I am a writer and editor with a passion for true storytelling. To me, science matters, research matters and knowledge matters, whatever the field.","The challenge in fiction is to write a terrific story. The challenge in journalism is to communicate solid, objective information. The challenge in creative non-fiction is to do it both and to do it well.","Journalists in newspapers and in many magazines are not permitted to be subjective and tell their readers what they think. Journalists have got to follow a very strict formulaic line, and here we come, these non-fiction writers, these former journalists who are using all the techniques that journalists are pretty much not allowed to use.","The people who are writing online and the people in my genre of creative non-fiction exert a great deal more freedom that journalists are allowed to exert in their day-to-day work.","To reconstruct stories and scenes, nonfiction writers must conduct vigorous and responsible research. In fact, narrative requires more research than traditional reportage, for writers cannot simply tell what they learn and know; rather, they must show it."],"Lee H. Hamilton":["I can assure you, public service is a stimulating, proud and lively enterprise. It is not just a way of life, it is a way to live fully.","Our democracy is not a product but a continual process. It is preserved not by monuments but deeds. Sometimes it needs refining; sometimes it needs amending; sometimes it needs defending. Always, it needs improving.","Foreign aid is neither a failure nor a panacea. It is, instead, an important tool of American policy that can serve the interests of the United States and the world if wisely administered.","Aid can work where there is good governance, and usually fails where governments are unable or unwilling to commit aid to improve the lives of their people.","U.S. officials and outside experts agree that China is undertaking a comprehensive modernization of its military. The Chinese military has gotten smaller but smarter.","Putting together a counter- terrorism policy, it's very easy to look at law enforcement or defense, military action or stopping the money flows or whatever, but the really difficult part is integrating all aspects of the policy, and I think she put a lot of emphasis on that.","Now the difficulty with those warnings is that they were not specific.","You'll remember Dr. Rice said that several times: It was not a warning about the place and the method and the time - it was a general warning. And that points out the imperfection, if you would, of our intelligence.","When you're talking with a person at this level of the government, at the very highest level, I think you have to be very discreet because he, President Clinton, is very aware that anything he says publicly can have a profound impact on American politics and on world politics.","Events often move faster than our ability to comprehend them.","But despite this breathtaking pace, I believe in the capacity of our democracy to meet these challenges.","But in the end our government usually - not unfailingly - is responsive to the people; and usually - not always - will try to do what is right.","Democracy fascinates me.","Democracy makes us articulate our views, defend them, and refine them.","This nation is never finished. It has to be re-created in each generation.","The temptations are great to simply retreat to the domain of private life and give up on our public problems.","We should insist that governments receiving American aid live up to standards of accountability and transparency, and we should support countries that embrace market reforms, democracy, and the rule of law.","We cannot do everything in Africa, but doing nothing is not an option.","A likely source for terrorists seeking to buy or steal nuclear materials is the former Soviet Union.","Protecting Americans from nuclear terrorism rises above politics.","For decades the American people have had an addiction to oil and gas.","One half of the world's people live on less than two dollars a day. This should concern our national security policy as well as our conscience.","The U.S has acquired reservoirs of goodwill around the globe over many years. But it is clear - from polling data and ample anecdotal evidence - that America is losing its allure in much of the world.","Addressing global resentment cannot be put off. If we do not learn to use our predominant power with great restraint, we will antagonize the world.","President George W. Bush is the first American president to call openly for two-states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.","The U.S. should support the historic Gaza withdrawal as a first step toward a final settlement: a permanent Palestinian state in Gaza and nearly all of the West Bank.","China's ability to deliver nuclear warheads on American cities is expanding.","So much of our attention is trained on the Middle East these days, but we cannot ignore East Asia."],"Lee Hall":["Whether you are a writer or an actor or a stage manager, you are trying to express the complications of life through a shared enterprise. That's what theatre was, always. And live performance shares that with an audience in a specific compact: the play is unfinished unless it has an audience, and they are as important as everyone else.","The point of theatre is transformation: to make an extraordinary event out of ordinary material right in front of an audience's eyes. Where the germ of the idea came from is pretty much irrelevant. What matters to every theatre maker I know is speaking clearly to the audience 'right now.'","Culture is something that we all share, and we are all the poorer for anyone excluded from it.","I only tend to think of the week ahead, to keep my eye on the ball and question whether a full stop is in the right place. It's easy to get distracted by the wrong things. If you start thinking of grand gestures, it's going to be a lot of hot air. You have to be logical. The theatre is a very logical place.","In a way, 'Billy Elliot' was autobiographical. I can't dance, but I think his dancing was me discovering about writing and literature.","In many ways, theatre is more rewarding for a writer. I used to think it was like painting a wall - that when the play is finished, it's done - but now I realise it's more like gardening; you plant the thing, then you have to constantly tend it. You're part of a thing that's living.","From kings to groundlings, Shakespeare made his work profound for everybody. That is how it should be. There is no hierarchy in theatre. It makes everyone part of a collective.","There is absolutely no point in not being a populist. What I feel emboldened to do is to take something which is a minority interest and make it accessible without dumbing it down. I'm such an enthusiast for peculiar things, things that are perhaps a bit avant-garde, and try and involve everyone.","I don't think theatre has changed; it's society that has changed.","My generation of playwrights have grown up writing for studio theatres, and so the task of writing for more than ten or so actors is a huge challenge. Logistically, it's like doing an enormous Sudoku. Making sure everyone is in the right place at the right time in the right order instantly sends me into a cold sweat.","The theatre has always been voraciously omnivorous. Dramatists have always raided every medium to find grist to their mill: myths, folk tales, newspapers, novels, films, works of art of all kinds.","I don't really find things funny unless they're deeply tragic at the same time. I think if you're funny just for the sake of being funny, it's just frivolous nonsense. To me, all the best comic plays have been written about really serious and rather bleak things.","I always call 'Billy Elliot' a fantasy autobiography because I never wanted to be a dancer, but I got a lot of stick from the other kids about wanting to be a writer and being interested in drama.","I come from a tradition where the writer writes a play for the actors, rather than for himself, and the dialogue is made to work onstage, so it needs actors to help shape it. So you never get a play right straightaway."],"Lee Haney":["I was able to get along with everybody. I really enjoyed all of those guys. They were unique in their own ways, and I think that's what made the sport fun. We had a great time laughing and having fun.","It takes more than just a good looking body. You've got to have the heart and soul to go with it.","Exercise is one of the best ways in preventing the rapid growth of obesity in America.","Exercise to stimulate, not to annihilate. The world wasn't formed in a day, and neither were we. Set small goals and build upon them.","Recent studies have revealed that children 8-10 years old are being diagnosed with Type II diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure at an alarming rate.","A systemic cleansing and detox is definitely the way to go after each holiday. It is the key to fighting high blood pressure, heart disease, cancer, and other health-related illnesses.","Health and fitness is who I am. It's what I do.","With the proper motivation, you can do anything. I was just a poor kid that ate pork and beans out of a can and apple sauce. I went from rags to riches. But it does take a lot of determination, inner strength, drive, and discipline.","I've watched a lot of guys through the years, and they hold their breath until they finally win The Big One, thinking then they can exhale and chill out. You have to breathe through life, man. Have fun.","Enrolling your child in a recreational sport sponsored by your neighborhood recreation community centers is a great way to keep kids active.","When I was 10, I asked my parents for a set of weights. I had my Charles Atlas book to go along with that. Every time we went to the grocery store, I'd rush to the magazine area and read the ones with Arnold Schwarzenegger and all those guys on the covers: 'Pumping Iron,' 'Muscle and Fitness,' 'Muscle Builder by Joe Weider.'","Parents must lead by example. Don't use the cliche; do as I say and not as I do. We are our children's first and most important role models.","To be physically fit is just a small aspect. You can be a beautiful physical specimen, but you're empty as far as what it takes to be a person, and that shows up real fast.","As the proud father of two teens and past Chairman to the Presidents Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, I am committed to educating parents and especially young people on ways to live a long, healthy and active life.","What your interests are has a lot to do with your natural abilities.","Walking is great to be used as an exercise program.","I've stayed basic through all the years. Beans, rice, fish, chicken. Water. Clean water. A must. Green vegetables, fruit, grains, whole wheat.","Mother Nature just gave me the ultimate physique.","Beginning with exercise, the best training program available for real results is circuit training.","PR is extremely important, and being able to use it in the right way means everything. You have to market your success.","When little old ladies recognize a guy who was Mr. Olympia, that's saying something. That means I've been able to cross lines as far as marketability is concerned.","With all of the holiday cheer in the air, it's easy to overlook the ingredients in the foods. Ingredients such as salt, sugar, and fat - all of which leads to diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, strokes, heart disease, and cancer.","More than ever, we as parents and a nation must do something about the growth of obesity in our children. We must do more than just talk, we must be concerned enough to act.","Most kids will not volunteer to eat veggies. At times you must step up to the plate and enforce the rule of authority as a parent.","Muscle and water is critical in burning fat.","When doing your aerobic exercise, go at a comfortable pace until you've developed more stamina.","Rule of thumb: Eat for what you're going to be doing, and not for what you have done. Don't take in more than you're willing to burn off.","The circuit training program along with a healthy clean diet is the way to excellent results.","When exercising, be sure to focus your attention on what you are doing.","When your goal is to put on muscle mass you must increase your calorie intake as you increase the activity level being given to the muscle.","It's my job to help people so that God can continue to help them live out the mission that they have... they've got to be healthy to do that.","I don't know any institution in this country that... carries more influence than the church.","I know that God gave me the blessing to use, to bring honor and glory to Him, and to use to impact the lives of people.","The key to building massive, powerful muscles is to doggedly increase the training weights you use.","If you've never been 40, you don't understand how it feels.","If you like playing basketball, you play basketball. If you like playing golf, you play golf.","I was naturally muscular from Day 1.","I think what makes me successful is that I'm so different from the other guys.","Once you get a perfect score, you don't want anything less. When you get less, then I guess it's time to step aside.","I love the way this sport has evolved and impacted every segment of society. Now you have cross training and weight training in every sport and from middle school kids to senior citizens.","Weight training has enjoyed a huge impact, and the transformation has gone mainstream. I'm fortunate to be part of it.","I was only 24 years old when I won my first Olympia. To be that young and the world champion was a lot of pressure. When I won the 8th one, I had the record. I was on top: that was the absolute best that I ever looked onstage, the best training and prep that I had done, and I had no regrets. I knew it was time to walk away.","I knew that I had to train with intensity and focus, but I never thought about the weight on the bar.","I benched up to 500 pounds one day and decided that was enough because I knew the risk of a pec tear or a shoulder injury would be catastrophic to my bodybuilding career.","I didn't train for powerlifting. I trained as a bodybuilder. I had to train to stress the muscle and not because of what was on the bar. I think my strategy was a good one because I have no aches, pains, or lingering injuries from training today. I feel great.","I do some dairy. I'm careful on that; it needs to be hormone free. But everybody has to have ice cream!","I wanted to be Samson or Hercules from the age of six."],"Lee Hazlewood":["When we did that kind of stuff our only rule was... Well, we didn't have any rules, really, but my rule, because I was the drinker of the group, was not at any time of the day before the night we're working.","So I became a producer because I knew one of the reasons was they didn't do them the way I thought was right.","Nobody heard records of you playing whatever the melody was on those low strings. It worked out good, you know, about 25 or 26 million records later. I guess it worked out alright.","People think I'm crazy because I travel too much, but I haven't been doing any of that lately because I got a little sick this year and I've tried to take care of it.","Oh no, I'm not a historian or anything like that.","If it was Europe, I just picked a country that I hadn't been to, but I didn't try to check up on what was going on in the country or anything like that. I just went and had a good time and met a lot of very nice people who are still my friends.","Sweden was very nice. I did a lot of television. I wrote, directed and was in a lot of television there.","The movie wasn't a hit, although it did well in Europe for some reason.","I just did one movie and there was no career for me, anyway.","I tell ya, I could have got some more jobs if I'd tried, but I went to Sweden instead.","The thing I hated about it was that you live in your trailer all the time and then they call you and you do maybe two dozen lines. Then they do that for three hours and you wait and wait and wait, and I don't like waiting.","Well, you'll find the most boring part of it is the waiting, at least if it's in films anyway. Television's a lot faster, but the product... I don't think it's as good as a film.","So anyway, I really enjoyed the European audiences.","You see I have to be in the clinic every Thursday and it's in Phoenix so I have to fly down or drive down. It has to be every Thursday for this damn stuff they're giving me.","I used to not stutter any. Oh, I did when I was a kid, I stuttered, I had a bad stutter until I was probably between the second and third grade and a guy got rid of it for me.","There's nothing worse, I guess, than being black in an all-white church or being southern and being a liberal.","I always liked circuses, so I would have enjoyed that.","I think for writers who write that kind of stuff, they want to make changes. Look at Kris Kristofferson and Dylan. I mean, whole generations come along liking that stuff and that's great."],"Lee Hsien Loong":["Everybody has his place; everybody is equal. Treated equally, equal standing, equal rights and status.","We have to work towards free trade because otherwise we will miss out on many opportunities for cooperation, and relations amongst countries will become much more difficult.","It has to be good to live in Singapore because otherwise, nobody will stand for it.","You have to understand that Singapore is quite different from Mauritius.","Chinese companies - telecommunications and technology companies - are some of the best internationally. Taobao, WeChat, Huawei - not only are they large companies, but they're also very technologically advanced.","I do not owe hundreds of millions of potential foreign workers from around the world an obligation. I owe Singaporeans a responsibility.","Over half a century working together on multiple issues, Singaporeans and Americans have made many enduring and close personal friendships.","We are looking for ways where you can have a sandbox, where you have a restricted environment within which people can try new things, and I can try new rules. And depending on what works, then I open up the sandbox, and it becomes the new rule for the whole system.","At some point, there will be some other financial crisis. It's in the nature of a capitalist system.","Singapore admires America's dynamism, vibrancy, and capacity for self-renewal. These qualities attract the best and brightest from around the world.","You look at the Americans. They don't lack fervour in moral causes. They promote democracy, freedom of speech, women's rights, gay rights, sometimes even transgender rights. But you don't see them applying that universally across the world with all their allies.","The world is a diverse place. Nobody has a monopoly on virtue or wisdom.","America excels not just through sheer individual talent but by working together with others.","I hope that soon after the next election, amongst them they will have decided, settled, and the leader will be ready to take over from me.","To represent the nation, you must have multiracial representation.","China is a very big and complicated country; it's not easy to govern. But with courage and unity, China will certainly overcome all difficulties and continue to develop and move forward.","It takes time, but I have a promising team of younger Ministers, and I am quite sure from amongst them, one leader will emerge.","Countries in Asia - Singapore, certainly, but many other countries too - are good friends to both China and America, and we would like to be good friends with both.","If you don't have that Singapore core, you can top up the numbers, but you are no longer Singapore. It doesn't feel Singapore - it isn't Singapore - and we can issue everybody red passports, but where is the continuity?","You need people who have their own views, whose views you respect, whom you can have a productive disagreement with, and work out ideas which you might not have come up with, or who improve on ideas you had.","Just as our forefathers saved and invested to build what we, the current generation, are enjoying today, so, too, we must plant trees so that our sons and daughters, and their sons and daughters, can enjoy the shade.","I hope to develop our relationship with the Trump administration and with the United States. It's a very sound relationship that's based on the basic strategic congruence of views about the world, about the region.","I think every administration has a settling-in process. And there's always an adjustment between what you can say during a campaign and what you find are the possibilities and the imperatives when you win the election and you enter the Oval Office.","We have long depended on an America which has got a clear sense of its stakes in the world and how much it depends on the world as well as how much the world and its allies and friends depend on the United States of America, and we hope this will continue.","I think we are paying a lot of attention to China one way or the other. They are a big factor in the world. They are successful; they are growing. They want to grow their influence, and all the countries in Asia want to be their friend and want to benefit from China's development and success.","In every American election, crazy things are said. Positions are taken which the winners try very hard to forget afterwards.","The Chinese go around with lollipops in their pockets. They have aid. They have friendship deals. They build you a Prime Minister's office or President's office or Parliament House or Foreign Ministry. For them, trade is an extension of their foreign policy.","The key thing in Northeast Asia is North Korea. They are unpredictable; they are developing their nuclear capabilities and their missiles.","The Chinese are quite clear what their interests are and very consistent on pushing their interests.","You have to have a sense of what it looks like, not from the point of view of the policymaker but from the point of view of those who are at the receiving end of your policies.","Every time you make a rule, somebody will think of a way to operate around the rule.","If you interview world leaders, everybody will say they are for free trade. But what they mean by it and what they do when they say they are pro free trade, you have to watch and see.","My infrastructure must run brilliantly. My whole system must be different from what you can get anywhere else in Asia.","What we can do in Singapore may not be doable elsewhere. Some things you know you need: you want efficient government, you want clean government, you want to do away with corruption, you must educate your people. You want to get housing and so on. All these are not such secrets, not so special to Singapore.","The tactics we were able to use in the 1960s, 1970s - let's have a campaign, mobilize everybody and, therefore, social pressure - stop littering, or stop spitting, or be courteous to one another: I am not sure that kind of approach will work anymore.","If you look at the young people today, they are passionate about all kinds of courses. We have dog-lovers, nature-lovers, those who are pursuing arts; we have quite many who are involved in religious activities through their church.","It's never easy to be a small country next to a big neighbor.","I would not say that the North Koreans will do anything that the Chinese want them to do.","If there are tensions between America and China, we will be asked to pick a side. It may not be directly, but you will get the message that, 'We would like you to be with us, and are you with us? If not, does that mean you're against us?' And that's to put it gently.","If you asked a Singaporean, on the one hand they'll say, 'Let us do our own things.' On the other hand, when an issue comes out, they'll ask, 'What is the government doing about it?'","No government prospers by saying, 'I don't need to do anything. Just by being there, we have made the country thrive.'","You have to have an idea of what you need to do, what needs to be fixed, what can be improved, what we should now imagine together which we didn't previously imagine. And having thought of it, decide to go it. And that's the government's role.","We are all in favor of the U.S. taking an active and constructive interest in Asia.","The U.S. is not a claimant state in the South China Sea or in the China-Japan dispute over the Senkaku Islands. But, of course, the 7th Fleet has been a presence in the region since the Second World War, and it is the most powerful fleet in the region.","One of the reasons America is welcome in Asia is because with America... there is a certain idealism and a certain bigness of soul. You want the region to prosper; you want countries to do well, and you are prepared to help them.","We want the U.S. to have constructive and stable relations with China. That makes it much easier for us. Then we don't have to choose sides.","We stand stoutly against all forms of terrorism, and cross-border terror is a particular problem that India has. Singapore has a problem with cross-border terror, too, because we are a very small country, and it is quite possible for an attack to be mounted on Singapore from beyond our shores.","The old model for India was to be self-sufficient. It was the ideal India became independent with, that you spin your own thread, make your own clothes.","It is never helpful to point at sticking points, but it is always helpful to encourage one's partners to take a more active and forward-looking approach.","We know India is very focussed on black money; it is a very high-focus subject and we have been very careful to make sure the investments into India are legitimate. There is no 'round-tripping' or hot money or bad money being funnelled through Singapore.","We are not in a situation where the minorities are demanding something and the majorities are pushing back saying 'We don't want it.'","There can only be one government, and the president has certain roles and duties, which are to hold the second key on money and on people but not to go and check the government or tell the government what it is supposed to do.","The natural result of people preferring one of their own race is that a minority race president will find it hard to get elected, and so it's something we should do something about and which we can do something about.","China is developing very quickly. At every stage, its needs are different.","Singapore needs to be able to continue to add value to China in order for the relationship to be worthwhile for both sides.","Whichever country we are talking to, we are concerned with economic cooperation, how to deepen our mutual dependence, how to find new areas of win-win.","We are open to the world; the world is at our doorstep. It washes in, not just through the windows, but we are immersed in it completely - through the Internet, through the media, through people traveling, coming here, as well as Singaporeans going abroad.","If we did not have a sense of who we were, how we got here, why we want to achieve something - which, on the face of it, on the logic of it, is probably not worth trying - and prove that logic wrong, then you wouldn't succeed; then you would just evaporate.","If you go overseas and meet people, you can detect a Singaporean from across the street - the way he dresses, slightly; the way he talks; the way he acts. There is a persona which is recognizable and which we are proud of.","The emerging economies, many of them are concerned. They didn't want the money to slosh in. They are afraid when the money sloshes out, but the tapering has to take place, and we have to be able to manage it.","Singaporeans generally feel more secure these days. One of our tasks is to remind them that this, a result of a continuing act of will and an appropriate sense of insecurity, is very helpful.","My colleagues went on the Internet, went on Facebook, and they found it helpful, and they persuaded me that I should try, so I did. It's quite fun provided you keep it in balance and... from time to time slip in a serious message.","When people say they don't want a nanny state, they are, in fact, in a conflicted state of mind. On the one hand, they want to do whatever they want and not be stopped. On the other hand, if something goes wrong, they want to be rescued.","Maybe Americans feel they don't need the rest of the world anymore, and they wish it would go away. We don't have that option.","China has been developing, growing in economic strength and its influence in the region. That will continue.","We are happy to see China prospering; we are happy to see China playing a constructive and positive role in the region.","China's influence is growing; it is natural that they want to integrate more, do more business with countries around them, and the Belt and Road is a constructive way in which they can do so.","No country can be an island unto itself or world unto itself. Not even the biggest country.","In our society, which is multiracial and multi-religious, giving offence to another religious or ethnic group, race, language, or religion is always a very serious matter.","Overall, we think religion is a good thing. I mean, if we were godless society, we would have many other problems; the communists found that out.","Criticism, any amount, we welcome it. Come, let's have a discussion - in Parliament, all the better.","If you make a defamatory allegation that the Prime Minister is guilty of criminal misappropriation of pension funds of Singaporeans, that's a very serious matter.","I don't have farmers I can convert into factory workers.","You have an administration which understands America's international responsibilities and interests, but you have a population which is anxious, tired, and doesn't want to bear any burden and pay any price. And that's very difficult for whoever becomes president.","For trade to grow, India must make a strategic decision that you want to encourage interdependence and more openness and more trade-based economy.","I think if you look at the Singapore projects, we wanted to do industrial parks. They have taken very long to clear the issues of land, and these become politicised, and you can't settle it, and eventually the project languishes and nothing happens.","We do have to watch to see how the foreign workers and immigrants are fitting in with our community, and you have to watch them mix so that you don't overbalance the numbers or the tone of our society.","There will always be frictions when you have a foreign worker population or immigrant population in the country, and we have to manage that, and that requires good behaviour and adjustment both on the part of the foreign workers and the immigrants as well as on the part of the Singaporeans.","If we have no foreign workers, our economy suffers; our own lives suffer.","There is always competition for influence, but there are also opportunities for cooperation.","You need to have good people: honourable, capable, committed in politics, standing in public office. It's not a guarantee, but it's the ideal we have to aim for.","Basically, if you become president, you must swear to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution and what the Constitution says.","You will always have politics being pushed towards multiracial politics because you have to field a team.","With Singaporeans, you speak English, you're well-educated, the doors open everywhere.","Nowadays, however strong an economy is, not all roads will lead only there. There will be other links between countries in Asia, with America, with Europe, and China will fit into this global network.","America is a great nation, not just because of your power and your wealth, but because of your high ideals, openness, and generosity of spirit."],"Lee Hyeon-seo":["Breathing in South Korea, even though the life here is not easy, makes me so happy. I feel that sitting in a coffee shop, having a cup of tea, and looking out of the window at the blue sky - this is happiness. Truly happiness.","A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s. Ultimately, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine, and many only survived by eating grass, bugs, and tree bark.","Many people - when they think about North Korea and the dictatorship, or the military or nuclear weapons, nuclear missiles, those things - tend to forget ordinary citizens are living there.","Some people criticize North Koreans and ask, 'Are they stupid? How can they believe those ridiculous things?' But I say, It doesn't matter if you're smart: if you were born in North Korea, you would be exactly like us. We don't know what freedom is. We have never enjoyed it.","History has proved that dictators can't last forever.","My favourite place in South Korea is Jeju Island: it's a tropical paradise with sandy beaches, turquoise waters, and the magnificent Geomunoreum lava tube system of underground caves.","North Korea is not the dictator's country; it's 25 million citizens' country, and they are suffering under the dictator. North Koreans are really nice, kind, pure people. I hate the dictator and the regime, but I love my home country.","Inside North Korea, we have many informants and spies watching everyone; they're paid by the government. Even a husband and wife can't trust each other.","In North Korea, we learnt all Americans are the enemy; they are not human.","North Korean defectors who speak out against the regime always feel nervous. We never know what the North Korean government is planning. It's really difficult for us to show our faces and speak out, but we feel obligated to do something to inform people about the ongoing tragedy inside North Korea.","People who live in North Korea, they die for food, but living in the free world, the cat even eats expensive sushi.","My favourite Korean food is delicious black five-layered pork belly, cooked over a charcoal grill. And Jeju chocolate, in citrus fruits and green tea flavour, which is famous throughout Korea.","Like every country, North Korea has some very smart people. They could be contributing a lot more to science and other areas, but North Koreans are forced to spend so much time memorising the fake history of our dictators and other propaganda, so are at a huge disadvantage.","When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet. And I grew up singing a song called 'Nothing To Envy.' And I was very proud. In school, we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung, but we never learned much about the outside world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.","As a child, every North Korean is very happy. We were very happy because we learned horrible things about the outside world, like in America and Japan. We thought they were suffering; that's why we were very happy... but in reality, we were living under fear.","We were taught North Korea is a heaven. They told us how people in western countries die in hospital or have no money to study in school.","I want to see reunified Korean peninsula, and I believe that the majority of Koreans in both countries want to see Korea become whole again.","I defected to South Korea in search of freedom of speech and movement. I had longed to put my feet on this soil, even in my dreams.","There are people who are destined to embrace endless pain and suffering, and there are people who desire to dream. Everybody dreams, of course. But does anybody desperately want to dream more than the people of North Korea?","We refugees, we become always a punchbag. A political punchbag between China and South Korea and North Korea.","From the moment I was born, I was fed propaganda. I viewed the Kim dynasty not only as our fearless protectors from the imperialist forces, but also as gods.","In China, it was hard living as a young girl without my family. I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee. But I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult, it's also very dangerous, since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants.","The moment I escaped to China, I didn't have any money; I only had one address in my hand of some long-distance Chinese relatives. I didn't know China was that big. I thought I can find their home very easily, and I would come back one week later. But then I found out the address was a 10-hour drive away.","In North Koreans, the moment we are born, we don't know there's another life existing outside of our country. The regime always told us all the bad things about the outside world, describing America as full of thieves, all human scum, beggars, everyday people dying on the streets and hospitals.","When I was 14, during Kim Il-sung's funeral, I wondered, 'How could a god die?'","Among the difficulties I encountered, economic problems were the worst. I found that financial hardships could limit one's ability to realize one's dream, no matter how desperate and earnest you are.","In communism, we never had any freedom - of movement, of speech, of press. We didn't even make own decisions for our lives, our future. We were human robots.","Freedom means everything to me. It is the most essential right that every person deserves. Most people take it for granted, but not North Koreans.","This is a divisive issue, but I really hope for unification. Even though we have been divided for a long time, we are all Koreans, so we should live together in a united Korea.","Leaving North Korea is not like leaving any other country. It is more like leaving another universe.","We considered the Dear Leader our god. That's huge. He's more than our parents. I thought all of the world respected Kim Il Sung. That's why we were bowing to their pictures.","My family lived under communism their entire lives. When they arrived in South Korea, they didn't even know how to use the bank system and ATM or the subway, nothing.","I've been so lucky, received so much help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans a chance to prosper with international support.","I don't hate the Chinese. We're brothers, and we share a border. I just hate the government, politicians, policies, not the people.","Many Chinese criticize me not only on Baidu but on Facebook. Some say, do you think Chinese authorities were stupid enough not to realize you were a North Korean defector? If they read my book, they'd understand. I did my best to escape. I think it's all a miracle. It's not because Chinese policemen were stupid enough to believe my fake story.","It was really tiring always pretending to be someone else. Not my life, not my real name, nothing.","No dictator can last forever. History shows that in the end, people around the dictator bring about change. Of course, a lot of high-ranking officials don't want change because they want to keep power. But there are other good people who want change. I believe they are waiting for the chance.","The TED talk I gave, that gave me another character I didn't know about. I'm not saying the mind of a hero, but a kind of responsibility. Every word I'm speaking, it's not from myself. I'm speaking for and representing the people of communist North Korea.","I just wanted to see China with my own eyes. I wanted to see whether North Korea was the best country in the world or China was the best. I grew up believing that China was much worse than North Kore, because that's what the regime told us.","When I explain to people what was the situation in North Korea, they think, how can such a country exist? They know North Korea is bad in some vague way, not clearly. But when we explain it, they then wonder how can a whole country be modern-day slaves?","We were all blocked from western media, outside information. We were captured in a virtual prison cell. People would disappear in the middle of the night - not every day, but sometimes. We hear about it, and we never knew what happened inside the prison camps. I learned about them after I escaped.","Certainly in North Korea, man is always superior to woman. Even the government treats women horribly. What is the slogan? Woman is a flower.","Hyesan people have money, the most after those in Pyongyang, because it's near the border with China. Illegal smuggling businesses and Chinese trading companies operate there, so people can access outside products.","When I was growing up, my mum was doing illegal smuggling with China. Sometimes she would see a fortune teller for advice. One time I went with her: 'In your future, you'll be living in foreign country and eating the foreign country rice,' she said.","Living in China, I found out that the bright new world was not for me, not for defectors. My life in North Korea had been OK; suddenly, in China, I had to feed myself and earn money. Worst of all, North Korean defectors are hunted by the government.","Kindness towards strangers is rare in North Korea. There is a risk to helping others. The state made accusers and informers of us all.","Hyeon means sunshine. Seo means good fortune. I chose it so that I would live my life in light and warmth and not return to the shadow.","Most people in the country didn't - and might still not - know about how powerful the United States is. They think North Korean weapons are the best in the world, and they're very proud of them. They believe they can protect the country from anyone.","We always had power shortages in the country. I was living right next to the border with China, and it was the only country I could compare to my own. When I looked across the river, it was a completely different world - there were no people dying. It looked like a place full of colour, and that's what confused me.","The North Korean regime really can control people. I think they are the best dictator in the whole planet.","Here in South Korea, I'm continuing to learn English in order to boost my prospects. When North Korean defectors try to get a job to stabilize their lives, their lack of English is a handicap. It was the same story while I was living in China. It took an enormous amount of time and enthusiasm to learn Chinese.","My mom told me many times how I need to be careful living inside the regime. We didn't say 'the regime.' We didn't even say 'North Korea.'","We can have reunification if another power replaces Kim Jong Un. I don't know who it could be, but I hope and I believe another power, another person will be better.","My life is not only mine. I am telling the story of all North Korean people; it is my responsibility to tell it.","I did my best to hide by changing my name many times. But I was captured by the Chinese police. But because my Chinese was so good, they thought I was Chinese and released me. That was a miracle.","North Koreans are tragically oppressed. Despite the risks to my personal safety, I feel a strong obligation to tell the world about the Orwellian nightmare that North Koreans face.","Due to hate, fear, and oppression, the North Koreans cannot help themselves.","Keeping families and friends divided is unforgivable.","My mom told me many times that when you are outside, you have to be careful what you are saying, and don't repeat the words of what you hear at home.","I was growing up in Hyesan, right by the closest North Korea-China border. China was just across the river: you could see across. So I was curious. On the river, on both sides, you have houses, then mountains. I wanted to know what was on the other side of the Chinese mountains.","North Korea is still my homeland, my country. I suffered on the outside because I was alien, without identity. I was nobody. I was in the worst situation, fighting for everything, to survive.","I believe I'll see the reunification of North and South Korea in my lifetime and that defectors should play a role in rebuilding the country. In the long run, I want to return to North Korea, because that's where I belong.","North Korean defectors can usually tell when other defectors are lying about their past.","If defectors say they had high-level connections in Pyongyang or came from an esteemed institution in the North, they can gain better employment in the South, where life can be very difficult for North Koreans.","Staying in China provided me with the opportunity to adjust to life outside of North Korea and to gain a sense of perspective, most importantly, by learning that so much of what I had been taught about my country was a lie.","I lived near the border with China, and one night, I simply left home and walked across the iced-over river that separated the two countries. I was fortunate that my family had close relationships with some of the border guards, so I was able to cross without incident.","The border crossing is the most dangerous moment for anyone attempting to escape. But my brother and mother had been waved off by every armed border guard along that stretch of the river.","Family is the most important thing: you can't buy them with money.","I'm not sure if my story will become a movie. Some of my western friends sent my story to people they know in the movie industry. But one consistent response was there aren't any main western characters in my story, so it's unlikely to be made into a movie in English.","It was very shocking for me to read newspapers that openly criticised the government in South Korea. That is impossible in North Korea and almost impossible in China. I was really impressed, and I became addicted to reading the news and watching the media so I could learn about the world. North Koreans would be stunned if they experienced this.","Even after arriving in South Korea, it's dangerous. As a North Korean defector, I need to be careful from the spies to protect my relatives inside North Korea.","I know North Korea is the most ridiculous country in the world, but for me, my mum, my brother, and my families and old memories are so important.","North Koreans are forced to work at state jobs in a moribund economy. Countless parents watch their children go to bed hungry. Many North Korean families feel they have no option but to try to escape.","I am one of the lucky North Koreans who made it out of China. North Korean defectors in the country are terrified of trying to leave because they are often caught at the borders as they attempt to cross into Mongolia or Laos.","Even though some heartless North Korean, Korean-Chinese, and Chinese citizens have exploited vulnerable defectors for money, I witnessed many acts of kindness by the Chinese.","On a bus ride through China, my family and I had talked for hours before a police officer boarded to conduct an inspection. My mother and brother couldn't speak Chinese, so they pretended to be deaf and mute, and none of the Chinese passengers said anything, sparing us.","Because North Korea was so totally cut off, we didn't hear anything of the outside world. We had only one TV channel, which showed only propaganda, and we believed everything.","For years, my Chinese family supported me, but they wanted me to have an arranged marriage, so I ran away and worked as a waitress. It was a tiny salary, but I was so happy; it was the first time I'd accomplished something.","I think it's possible that China is ready for a serious change regarding its North Korean defector policy. Chinese people are starting to realize that so many defectors have been suffering in China, and it doesn't have to be this way.","I can't be sure of exactly when and how North Korea will change. But I do believe it will happen, hopefully in my mother's lifetime.","When I was young, I thought Kim il-Sung or Kim Jong-il is hero.","I don't think the North Korean leadership is interested in a genuine deal to end their WMD programs or their stranglehold on the North Korean people.","I hate the Chinese government. If you do not want to embrace North Korean defectors in your country, I understand. But we have a country where we can seek asylum. So please, let us freely pass through. Why are you doing your best to try and catch defectors?","When many Chinese escaped to North Korea during the Cultural Revolution, we embraced them. People in China have forgotten about this.","China is a heaven compared to North Korea."],"Lee Iacocca":["The speed of the boss is the speed of the team.","In times of great stress or adversity, it's always best to keep busy, to plow your anger and your energy into something positive.","Trouble shared is trouble halved.","To succeed today, you have to set priorities, decide what you stand for.","The discipline of writing something down is the first step toward making it happen.","Motivation is everything. You can do the work of two people, but you can't be two people. Instead, you have to inspire the next guy down the line and get him to inspire his people.","The only rock I know that stays steady, the only institution I know that works, is the family.","Management is nothing more than motivating other people.","The one word that makes a good manager - decisiveness.","My father always used to say that when you die, if you've got five real friends, then you've had a great life.","If you want to make good use of your time, you've got to know what's most important and then give it all you've got.","The most successful businessman is the man who holds onto the old just as long as it is good, and grabs the new just as soon as it is better.","Start with good people, lay out the rules, communicate with your employees, motivate them and reward them. If you do all those things effectively, you can't miss.","We've got to pause and ask ourselves: How much clean air do we need?","I always go back to Harry Truman: Should we drop an atomic bomb to save 100,000 lives? That's a hell of a decision to make. Did he make that decision by himself? No, he had advisers.","We are continually faced by great opportunities brilliantly disguised as insoluble problems.","Decisiveness is the one word that makes a good manager.","I hire people brighter than me and then I get out of their way.","The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind.","So what do we do? Anything. Something. So long as we just don't sit there. If we screw it up, start over. Try something else. If we wait until we've satisfied all the uncertainties, it may be too late.","The kind of people I look for to fill top management spots are the eager beavers, the mavericks. These are the guys who try to do more than they're expected to do - they always reach.","The ability to concentrate and to use time well is everything.","I was at Ford for 32 years. I went to Chrysler in 1978, four or five months after I got canned by Henry Ford.","The affections are like lightning: you cannot tell where they will strike till they have fallen.","It was emotional when Chrysler sold out to the Germans.","In a completely rational society, the best of us would be teachers and the rest of us would have to settle for something else.","I have found that being honest is the best technique I can use. Right up front, tell people what you're trying to accomplish and what you're willing to sacrifice to accomplish it.","I've always found that the speed of the boss is the speed of the team.","In the end, all business operations can be reduced to three words: people, product, and profits.","Any supervisor worth his salt would rather deal with people who attempt too much than with those who try too little.","Talk to people in their own language. If you do it well, they'll say, 'God, he said exactly what I was thinking.' And when they begin to respect you, they'll follow you to the death.","You can have brilliant ideas, but if you can't get them across, your ideas won't get you anywhere.","I have always found that if I move with seventy-five percent or more of the facts that I usually never regret it. It's the guys who wait to have everything perfect that drive you crazy.","What is wrong with changing your mind because the facts changed? But you have to be able to say why you changed your mind and how the facts changed.","Apply yourself. Get all the education you can, but then, by God, do something. Don't just stand there, make it happen.","One of the things the government can't do is run anything. The only things our government runs are the post office and the railroads, and both of them are bankrupt.","Every business and every product has risks. You can't get around it.","No matter what you've done for yourself or for humanity, if you can't look back on having given love and attention to your own family, what have you really accomplished?","There are times when even the best manager is like the little boy with the big dog, waiting to see where the dog wants to go so he can take him there.","There is no substitute for accurate knowledge. Know yourself, know your business, know your men.","People want economy and they will pay any price to get it.","We at Chrysler borrow money the old-fashioned way. We pay it back.","If a guy is over 25 percent jerk, he's in trouble. And Henry was 95 percent.","The trick is to make sure you don't die waiting for prosperity to come.","I forgot to shake hands and be friendly. It was an important lesson about leadership.","Chrysler builds great cars.","A guy named Charlie Beacham was my first mentor at Ford. He taught me the importance of the dealers, and he rubbed my nose in the retail business.","I guess I invented extended warranties, because that's all we had to sell at Chrysler in those days.","I guess that's one achievement I'm really proud of. Saving Chrysler was more than jobs, more than shareholder value. Saving Chrysler was a good idea for the whole country.","In a corporation, there can only be one guy in the end: the CEO.","Chrysler invented rebates, I'm sorry to say. I didn't have anything to do with that. A lot of flaky deals were made in order to give the customer enough cash for a down payment."],"Lee J. Cobb":["The HUAC did a deal with me. I was pretty much worn down. I had no money. I couldn't borrow.","When the facilities of the government of the United States are drawn on an individual, it can be terrifying.","If this gesture was the way of getting out of the penitentiary, I'd do it."],"Lee Jong-suk":["While acting in 'W,' my worries about the way I act settled down. I also discovered another side of myself. It was a turning point.","In 'W,' I did not change a word in the script. I have never spoken this much in other series. I just stick to whatever is written. I always carry the script with me and read it before I sleep."],"Lee Konitz":["A first love always occupies a special place.","I wish that person outside would stop coughing.","I have been able to get a small audience. It's not the huge audience, but it's enough to make it possible to play. I appreciate that.","Out of Coltrane's whole history, there are things which I think are great from all the periods.","I love Indian music very much, but I haven't studied that specifically.","I always felt as a horn player, a jam session wasn't satisfying enough for me. I should have been a rhythm section player, actually.","Benny Goodman was one of the big influences as a clarinet player. That's why I wanted the clarinet.","A lot of bands were doing remotes from ballrooms around the country.","I understood that if I wanted to work, the saxophone was the main instrument. The clarinet was what we call a double.","Names and theoretical things don't occur to me. If they do, I'm not doing my real playing mode.","I could stop and say, Well that was a D minor, G seven, but I really don't want to know that. I just want to know that there's a combination of notes that makes a sound.","In some ways Lester Young is the most complex rhythmically of any musician. He does some things which are just phenomenal.","It was 100 percent music. There was no ego involved, no attitudes, no black and white, it was pure music.","I just completed a tour in Europe. I played every night. This requires traveling some days for six hours in a van or a train or a car. After six weeks of that, I checked into the hotel and just fell apart.","I hear many extra-musical things somehow in Coltrane.","After playing now for 60 years, it's still very challenging for me to play a simple melody and have it clean and touch the reed at the proper time in the proper way.","We all learn from each other, and I never really hung out with guys in that way, so I missed out.","Many people do think it's naive to improvise in front of paying customers. I'm not saying one way is better than another.","Most jazz players work out their solos, at least to the extent that they have a very specific vocabulary.","I'd like to feel that whatever I play is a result of whatever I've heard.","I listen to classical music very much. There's a lot of jazz that I don't enjoy listening to.","As long as there are people trying to play music in a sincere way, there will be some jazz.","You just keep playing. If someone special comes along and organizes it in a new way, then you'll have another approach and everybody will jump on it to try to learn.","It's very demanding to make up your own music.","Bernstein grew up in my building in New York. He's a very, very fine player. When he was a kid, he came by to find out what was going on in the world of jazz.","Sound is the first thing that we tune into.","Labels don't mean anything to me. I'm trying to play as passionately as I'm able to. If they want to call that cool, that's fine. Just spell the name right, is the formula."],"Lee Krasner":["With Jackson there was quiet solitude. Just to sit and look at the landscape. An inner quietness. After dinner, to sit on the back porch and look at the light. No need for talking. For any kind of communication.","At that point it certainly would be called abstract. That is to say, you had a model and there'd be one or two or three people there drawing the model but otherwise you had abstractions all around the room, even though the model was in front of you.","My own image of my work is that I no sooner settle into something than a break occurs. These breaks are always painful and depressing but despite them I see that there's a consistency that holds out, but is hard to define.","Painting... in which the inner and the outer man are inseparable, transcends technique, transcends subject and moves into the realm of the inevitable.","People were very affected by the war. But it didn't mean you stopped painting unless you were called into the Army; then you just couldn't paint. But otherwise one continued.","I have never been able to understand the artist whose image never changes.","As I say, I as an abstract artist was active politically.","I knew de Kooning and I went to his studio so I knew about de Kooning's work. But only a little handful knew about it, you know. Maybe there were ten people that knew about it.","In the late 30s the name Pollock was totally unknown and unheard of.","My studio was on 9th Street between University and Broadway.","The Jumble Shop would be one place where we'd sometimes accumulate down in the Village. I think it might be just a place that's unknown that was right around the corner from wherever it was that we met.","The procedure was that an artist got a mural and then he would have anywhere from two to ten assistants depending on the size of the mural and how many assistants he needed, or she needed.","Well, I'd say that the beginning of this thing came through with Art of This Century, Peggy Guggenheim's, where she opened this gallery and began showing some things that caused a little talk, amongst a lot of other things.","Well, let's say we acknowledged the School of French Painting - the Paris School of painting as the leading force and vitality of the time.

You did submit work to be accepted. Once you were accepted that was it. You did your own selection of what went in."],"Lee Kuan Yew":["If you deprive yourself of outsourcing and your competitors do not, you're putting yourself out of business.","The problem is to keep the monkey mind from running off into all kinds of thoughts.","My children were educated in what were then Chinese schools, and they learned English as a subject. But they made up when they went to English-language universities. So they didn't lose out. They had a basic set of traditional Confucian values. Not my grandchildren.","At the end of the day, is Singapore society better or worse off? That's the test.","I support the view that free trade in goods and services is a win-win situation. I'm not so convinced that free flows of capital without restriction is a win-win situation.","We are pragmatists. We don't stick to any ideology. Does it work? Let's try it, and if it does work, fine, let's continue it. If it doesn't work, toss it out, try another one. We are not enamored with any ideology.","In the East, the main object is to have a well-ordered society so that everybody can have maximum enjoyment of his freedoms. This freedom can only exist in an ordered state and not in a natural state of contention and anarchy.","How do I comfort myself? Well, I say, 'Life is just like that.'","Let the historians and the Ph.D. students work out their doctrines. I'm not interested in theories per se.","As an East Asian looking at America, I find attractive and unattractive features. I like, for example, the free, easy and open relations between people regardless of social status, ethnicity or religion.","The enduring lesson is war is a disaster. Whoever wins, tremendous loss of life, property - a set back for civilisation.","The ultimate test of the value of a political system is whether it helps that society to establish conditions which improve the standard of living for the majority of its people.","If Singapore is a nanny state, then I am proud to have fostered one.","I know if I rest, I'll slide downhill fast.","I always tried to be correct, not politically correct.","The original communitarianism of Chinese Confucian society has degenerated into nepotism, a system of family linkages, and corruption, on the mainland. And remnants of the evils of the original system are still found in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and even Singapore.","The difficult part was getting the people to change their habits so that they behaved more like first world citizens, not like third world citizens spitting and littering all over the place.","You need a certain standard of literacy, moral and ethical values, to be able to run a one man, one vote system.","The acid test of any legal system is not the greatness or the grandeur of its ideal concepts, but whether, in fact, it is able to produce order and justice.","The exuberance of democracy leads to undisciplined and disorderly conditions which are inimical to development.","China is not going to become a liberal democracy; if it did, it would collapse. I do not believe you can impose on other countries standards which are alien and totally disconnected with their past.","All my life... I believed in Malaysian merger and unity of the two territories. You know that we, as a people, are connected by geography, economics, by ties of kinship.","Of-course we did, but we didn't reply because we knew once this leaks the others will scatter, so in the few days we moved quickly before the press got hold of it. The press did get hold of it a few days later, we nabbed, we were able to get 15, the others got away.","China is a vast, disparate country; there is no alternative to strong central power.","A military presence does not need to be used to be useful.","I was a product of the times, the war, the occupation, the reoccupation, my 4 years in Britain, admiring but at the same time questioning whether they are able to do a better job than we can.","Well if done a lot of hard work to try and get people to act rationally, the fact that weve had 15 deviant Muslims, plus 5 or 8 others that got away does not mean that all Muslims are deviant or extremists.","Freedom of the news media must be subordinated to the overriding needs of Singapore, and to the primacy of purpose of an elected government.","China itself is now in the process of sloughing off not only the communist system, but also those outdated parts of Confucianism that prevent the rapid acquisition of knowledge needed to adjust to new ways of life and work.","I can feel the gradual decline of energy and vitality. And I mean generally, every year, when you know you are not on the same level as last year.

The Confucian theory was man could be improved, but I'm not sure he can be. He can be trained; he can be disciplined.","From 1945 to 1991, China was engaged in a series of wars that nearly broke them. This generation has been through hell: the Great Leap Forward, hunger, starvation, near collision with the Russians - the Cultural Revolution gone mad. I have no doubt that this generation wants a peaceful rise.","I'm reaching 87, trying to keep fit, presenting a vigorous figure, and it's an effort, and is it worth the effort? I laugh at myself trying to keep a bold front. It's become my habit. I just carry on.","You either use the Internet or you are backward.","The First World became a popular phrase in about the 1970s and '80s. The World Bank then began categorizing countries in different categories, advanced to the least developed.","I knew that my niece was working nearby with some bank, so my wife rang up the mother and the mother called back to say that shes just called up to say she was alright.","Countries that are agricultural can, at a low standard of living, sustain themselves. You can be self-sufficient; the money economy is a relatively insignificant part of the total economy. Singapore never was an agricultural country.","The big nest was in Afghanistan, thats not quite cleared, then there are nests in the Philippines, there are nests in Indonesia, the Malaysians are clearing up their nests.","In the West, especially after World War II, the government came to be seen as so successful that it could fulfill all the obligations that in less modern societies are fulfilled by the family.","After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and China are more likely to view each other as competitors if not adversaries. But the die has not been cast. The best possible outcome is a new understanding that when they cannot cooperate, they will coexist and allow all countries in the Pacific to grow and thrive.","President Nixon was a pragmatic strategist. He would engage, not contain, China, but he would also quietly set pieces into place for a fallback position should China not play according to the rules as a good global citizen.","America's greatest long-term influence on China comes from playing host to the thousands of students who come from China each year, some of the ablest Chinese scholars and scientists. They will be the most powerful agents for change in China.","I've got one grandson gone to MIT. Another grandson had been in the American school here. Because he was dyslexic, and we then didn't have the teachers to teach him how to overcome or cope with his dyslexia, so he was given exemption to go to the American school. He speaks like an American. He's going to Wharton.","Those who believe that after I have left the government as prime minister, I will go into a permanent retirement, really should have their heads examined.","It's irrelevant to me what young Singaporeans think of me. I've lived long enough to know that you may be idealised in life and reviled after you're dead.","I would not score very highly on religious value.","Prudence dictates that there should be a balance of power in the Asia-Pacific region.","Peace and security in the Asia-Pacific will turn on whether China emerges as a xenophobic, chauvinistic force, bitter and hostile to the West because it tried to slow down or abort its development, or whether it is educated and involved in the ways of the world - more cosmopolitan, more internationalized and outward looking.","I'm not guided by what Human Rights Watch says.","I am not interested in ratings by Freedom House or whatever.","Latecomers to industrial development have had to catch up by finding ways of closing the gap.","The values that East Asian culture upholds, such as the primacy of group interests over individual interests, support the total group effort necessary to develop rapidly."],"Lee Kun-hee":["There's an ongoing competition by global companies across all areas from products, technology development and hiring talented people to patent disputes.

So the majority of people's trust in North Korea has gone down considerably.","Including myself, the majority of the Korean people believe in this staunch alliance between Korea and the United States and all of us hope that our traditional alliance will be further strengthened in the future.","The endgame is peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula.","I plan to lower corporate taxes to create an environment that encourages companies to invest more.","Yes, I don't believe that the inter-Korean relationship has, quote, 'deteriorated' since I assumed office. Rather I believe that the relationship between the two Koreas is entering into a new phase - a time of transition. And so I think that the North Koreans are trying to see what they can build with this, with my new administration.","My wife, well she has extensive experience, because before becoming the first lady, she was the wife of the CEO of a large conglomerate. So I have very high hopes that she will carry out her job successfully as first lady of the Republic of Korea.","Well when I was young, actually not just me, but we were all poor. Korea used to be one of the poorest countries in the world. Despite such circumstances, I was very, very fortunate to be blessed with having parents who always instilled in a spirit of can-do spirit.","With the lessons taken from the financial crisis in 1997, the Republic of Korea has been able to surmount the global economic crisis rather successfully.","First of all, I think all countries in the world have agreed it is not in anyone's interest to test-fire a missile, or whatever its is.","Fortunately, when Korea was struck by the 1997/8 financial crisis, that was a good opportunity for us to engage in fundamental reforms and strengthen our financial structure. As a result, our financial regulatory structure and regime have been very much strengthened.","The North Koreans have gained, or bought, a lot of time through the six-party-talks framework to pursue their own agenda.","One of the most important reasons for North Korea continuing its nuclear ambitions is to consolidate the power to stay within the Kim Jong Il family.","If we are to assume that North Korea becomes a nuclear-power state, of course the danger of having an all-out nuclear war, that possibility is very slim.","I know that throughout their history, the people of the United States defended their freedom, their liberty, their justice, and their rights - if need be - with their lives. I think their courage is so admirable.","I plan to eliminate regulations that hinder domestic companies, particularly large conglomerates from investing in other companies.","Korea is an open society and we will make sure that there is no restriction on foreign investment in Korea.","I plan to eliminate the equity cap in investment, and I also plan large-scale deregulation to meet global standards.","Fiscal crises often turn into financial crises, dealing a blow to the real economy.","The role of G-20 is to support the global economy to achieve strong, sustainable and balanced growth.","Talking about Korea, it has pretty high capital ratios at banks and maintains a good credit rating.","I've noticed that in the U.S., when the president hits the three-year mark in office, he goes into re-election campaigning.","Just to take a couple steps back historically, Korea, as you can see, is located among what we call big countries. And historically we've always been the victim of numerous invasions and whatnot.","I think within Japan there is talk about how there is the need to reassess the future of the U.S.-Japan alliance.","For us, from Korea's perspective, China is the number one investment destination as well as number one trading partner.","From the Chinese perspective, Korea ranks about third or fourth in terms of trading volume and about third in terms of investment.","I do believe that both countries, China and Russia, that both of them are responsible countries.","The Nuclear Security Summit was President Obama's initiative born out of his vision to leave behind a safer, more prosperous world for the future generation.","I think it's safe to say that it's rather premature for anyone to make any initial assessment or analysis of Kim Jong-un, or have an accurate impression on Kim Jong-un.","Merit should count more than academic background.","I'm well aware of the people's wishes.","I will serve the people in a very humble way."],"Lee Norris":["Every day that I get to step onto a set is a good day for me.","I've just gotten to do a lot of very different things, and as an actor, that's what you want.","I've just grown up a lot and started to encounter some of the big decisions of life in terms of what career I wanted to do and figuring out personal relationships and things.","I went to an ACC school, Wake Forest, I'm a big college basketball fan, and it was just a natural interest for me.","I love acting; I don't want to give up on it at all, but it would be nice to step behind the camera once in a while as well.","I'm an actor, and I love the art of creating a character.","I love to work."],"Lee Pace":["It's the writers' job to make it positive. It's my job to make it real.","I'd forgotten it's an important thing to give thought to your morality and how you intend to live your life.","Not even my excellent training at Juilliard prepared me for my first movie role, where I played a transsexual who falls in love with a military guy in 'Soldier's Girl.'","I picked up reading late because I grew up dyslexic. When I went to college, a friend who was a big reader got me started on a number of writers, including Hemingway.","I love that you work out relationships with people as you're filming just to get something real to play on screen.","With TV, you have so much to get done during the day that you don't really have a lot of time to feel your way through it. I know before I walk on the set exactly what I'm going to do. With film you can kind of find your way in it a little more, play with it some.","I tried surfing once in Brazil, but I'm kind of clumsy.","A month before graduation I got an off-Broadway job. Then I did some commercials, including one for MCI. You can only see half of me, but it paid well. Thank God for commercials.","I don't really get recognized.","I grew up in a house with dogs. We always had dogs. We always had a bunch of dogs, actually.","I had a Commodore, and then I remember getting a Nintendo for Christmas and it being a total game-changer. And the hours that I would spend playing the video game and trying to convince my mother that it was improving my hand-eye coordination. It was a worthy use of time. It made my hand-eye coordination better!","I am a huge Michael Jackson fan.","It is a total treat to get to work with James Cromwell.","If I'm, like, in a grocery store, I don't get recognized that much, but it's like, you know, when someone comes up to me and says, 'Hey, I'm a big 'Pushing Daisies' fan,' you just feel like, 'Oh, wow - you're the one who watched it. So nice to meet you.'","' Daisies' is about a guy touching dead people and bringing them back to life. It's kind of morbid, you know. But there's a love to it. There's a kind-heartedness to it that I think makes it - I don't know; it's a good thing to put out there in the world, so I'm glad people responded.","It's one of the things I love about my job: it's my job to help a director tell the story, to just be willing to help.","I left school my senior year to do a play at the Alley Theatre in Houston, Texas. Then while I was doing a play, I auditioned for Juilliard. I got in over the summer, and they told me, 'You have to graduate high school to come here. You don't need the SATs, but you do need to graduate high school.' I finished over the summer through correspondence.","I grew up in the Middle East. My folks have a very thick, kind of Oklahoma accent; that's where I was born. But we moved to the Middle East right after I was born, so I guess we were surrounded by English people and French people.","It's important to complete things and finish what you started.","What I enjoy most about 'The Lord of the Rings' is that extended cut. To be able to sit there on a Sunday afternoon and watch 'The Lord of the Rings' from beginning to end is pretty fun.","I think Peter Jackson and Philippa Boyens have very carefully plotted 'The Hobbit' out so that it does feel like the starting point for 'The Lord of the Rings.'","I've dated men. I've dated women. I don't know why anyone would care.","It's totally fun to play troublemakers - totally.","'Kill Bill' is one of my favorite movies of all time.","Trust me: if I had something interesting to say about myself, I would.","Who cares about people's personal lives? I mean, honestly. How are you then able to disappear into a role?","When I was a kid, I played 'Super Mario Bros' and 'Megaman 2' and '3' for hours and hours, trying to convince my mother they were good for me because they helped my hand-eye coordination. They influenced a whole generation of people to make computers what they are now, through problem-solving and so on.","When you play the king of elves and alien warlords, little me is very uninteresting. But, at the same time, actors feel this obligation to be transparent, and I truly don't understand the point.","The roles I think about and can't stop thinking about - on the subway, when I'm riding my bike, when I'm running - are the things I connect to.","It's not my business to think about the business; it's my business to think about the character. Sure, there have been times in my career where I wished I was more popular or more this or more that - but that's just stupid.","The older I get, the happier I am with the way my career has gone. Although, in many ways, it's been through no design of my own.","I think people are really picky about English accents. When a Brit comes over here and kind of does an OK American accent, everyone's like, 'You were great! Fantastic!' But in England, even if you were doing a pretty good accent, they're like, 'But where are you from?' 'London.' 'What part of London?' Accents are really precious over there.","It's kind of really fun to get to dress up, because you take yourself a little more seriously if you dress nice in a starched shirt.","I had a fantastic time working on 'Twilight.' I loved our director Bill Condon. He was an absolute pleasure to work with.","Peter Jackson has the sort of imagination that no one else has."],"Lee Pearson":["I feel lucky that I found my talent, not unlucky that I was born with a disability. When I'm on a horse, I'm more worried about what the riding hat is doing to my hair than what my bent legs and arms are doing. What riding has given me is respect.","When people chat to me about my childhood and getting into horses, they're like, 'Was it like the birds sang and the sun came out? Was it an amazing experience?' I'm like, 'No, it was rubbish. I was frightened. I was pretty unbalanced, and most ponies took advantage of me.'","The Paralympic Games actually turned my whole mentality around about disability. When you're in the Paralympic athletes' village and there are 4,000 disabled people, you stop seeing disability. Totally.","I've got a quad bike, which I've raced against neighbours. You could give me a go-kart with a lawnmower engine - I'd still have fun. I like jet skis, speedboats, all the boys' toys.","I just love the development of horses, getting into their brains, making them more athletic and powerful, responsive, and I'm rubbish at everything else.","I'm a gay disabled man who has become very successful. I don't get up in the morning and think I'm inspirational; I just get up thinking that I love horses.","My great grandfather had been the neighbourhood 'horse whisperer,' so I've probably loved horses since I was an embryo. Whenever I watched cowboy films as a small child, I wasn't watching the hunky cowboys - which I'd probably do now - I was watching the horses. Even now, I love sitting in the field just watching the way they move.","When I pull my white Range Rover into disabled parking bays, the abuse that I get until I actually get out on my crutches is phenomenal, because people presume that you couldn't possibly be disabled and reverse a white Range Rover into that parking space.","Whether I'm riding a horse or driving a car, I'm feeling them, judging what they're doing, trying to work out what I can take them up to.","I had a donkey called Sally that I used to call my BMX bike. As a child, I wasn't a very good horse rider: I thought falling off was normal, and I would just get back on again. I didn't realise you weren't meant to fall off.","Paralympics has always had to push the media into it being about sport and not focusing on the disability.","I think it's phenomenal and expected that Paralympians will take on able bodied people more and more. In dressage, it happens all the time. But there are very few adaptions, and they are never allowed to give you an advantage.","My motivation is paying the mortgage. No joke. Honestly. I still suffer with nerves and think, 'Why am I putting myself through this torture?' It's not actually the love of winning - it's that building of a partnership with a horse. Just riding horses every day keeps me going. And that threat of losing the mortgage.","I always say I'm one of the most normal abnormal people you'll ever meet. I get embarrassed about how many medals I've won, and I get angry when people presume that because you're gay you've got to wear pink and stilettos and camp it up, or that if you're disabled you should act like a victim and not have a life.","I don't just love riding; I love horses. I was in the field at my yard watching them gallop around and play the other day. That's what keeps me going, and sometimes it has to be something more than just winning.","I'm just a genetic freak, but it has never stopped me from doing whatever I want to.","I joke that the Olympics is the warm-up to the Paralympics.","I've dominated past competitions, but I've sweated blood and tears for every medal. I take nothing for granted, and I'm fully focused on doing my best.","I couldn't pedal a bike as a child, so I had a donkey instead. I loved the power and freedom it had.","Before taking up dressage, I'd distanced myself from the Paralympics because I hadn't wanted to be defined by my disability. Then when I grew up and got an office job, things started to change. I'm actually allergic to horses, but I'm even more allergic to paperwork!","I understand when people think dressage is boring. But while your standard horse is like driving a Fiesta, our horses are like driving Formula One cars. I can't breathe without the horse reacting. You are training another being to become really responsive and athletic and powerful.","You know that the world is a better place when people can come up to a severely disabled person and say: 'Well done. You are an inspiration.'","My life's been surreal from start to finish.","I'm not really into the fame thing. I've met so many celebrities now, and everybody's just the same. I'm a bit of a family bird.","I've thought about adopting, but I'm a bit paranoid that because I'm gay and disabled I'd be put straight off the list. My mother thinks that I would jump the queue because they like minorities adopting. I have great genes, though, and I would like to pass them on.","If you don't like something, change it. My parents expected me to stay in my office job as an administrator at the Co-op because I'm disabled, but I said no and changed my whole life.","I've stayed in the best hotels in the world, but you could put me in prison, and I'd still have fun.","If you try singling me out to my mother, she'll be down your throat. She has three sons, and she's equally proud of us all.","I'm afraid to say I was Mr. Popular at school. I went out with all the girls in my year - I quite liked girls back then - and even dated ones in the year above.","For me, Paralympic sport isn't about being the best human being. It's about being the best human being with that particular level of disability."],"Lee R.

Whether his or her constituency is a corporation and its shareholders or the customers in a small and privately held business, his or her first responsibility is to serve that constituency.","It makes no sense to talk of the social obligations of the corporation without reference to its economic obligations. The two are intertwined.","A free economy is as essential to society as democratic political institutions. A strong market-based economy is the fertile ground for democratic freedoms that we think are important.","The freedoms that people have that flow from all civic institutions fundamentally come from the success of a market system.","In every aspect of life, including the economic dimension, we are always challenged to do the right thing. In many cases in the market system, which allows a great deal of latitude for human choice, people can get carried away to excess.","We have seen that in this country in the last few years, particularly on Wall Street, with the rise of the old human frailty of greed. This occurs when people begin to serve only their own needs to the detriment of everyone else.","There is no system that is inherently moral if the participants themselves are not.","The market system requires that people be committed and willing to work hard. Inherent with that is what I call a merit system, which I think gives people the greatest opportunity.","We should seek a system that provides outlets for those skills and talents so that everyone can find a way to work and serve in a manner that best suits the strengths of each individual.","Without competition, the spectacular development of technology that we have seen in the last one hundred years in this country would not have happened.","Ethical conduct is something that becomes inherent in an organization over a long period of time.","In some of the countries where we operate, there is a tradition of corruption, in which the political elites work with business in the framework of unsavory relationships.","I find it interesting that many of the people who want to restrict fossil fuels live in well-developed countries where abundant and affordable energy is readily available.","I have a great deal of difficulty with those who live in a hugely prosperous country telling people in the developing world that they should be deprived of a critical source of energy.","There is hardly an activity that a person can think about that does not intrinsically involve energy, most of which is currently provided by fossil fuels.","We obviously want to produce things that people want. We are going to continue to do that in an environmentally responsible way, while still being aware of the physical, scientific, and practical issues that we have to deal with."],"Lee Radziwill":["I believe that without memories there is no life, and that our memories should be of happy times.","I always begin a room with the rug; it is literally the foundation of the space. I then go on to the furniture.","When I was seven and we lived in New York, I ran away. I took my dog and started out across the Brooklyn Bridge... I didn't get very far... It's rather difficult to run away in your mother's high heels.","Decorating has always been my hobby.","There were so many things I couldn't do when my brother-in-law was president.","There's a McDonald's in the Louvre.","One can't help but be a bit melancholy when you see how the world has changed, and I don't mean that nostalgically.","If I really can be said to have a personal style, I think it is reflected in my taste for the exotic and the unexpected. I like to create rooms which are essentially traditional - and then add touches of the bizarre and the delicious.","As a child, the person I admired most in the world was Lana Turner! She seemed the epitome of glamour, and her glitzy surroundings so enviable, the opposite of my mother's extremely banal taste.","Regrets? I think everyone has regrets, and people who say they haven't are either liars... or narcissists.","Marriage is an extremely difficult relationship.","Jackie's dream was France, but mine was really art and Italy, as that was all I cared about through school. My history of art teacher, who saved my life at Farmington, was obsessed with Bernard Berenson, and I succumbed as well.","There is something to be said for being older - and memories.","I am always aware that I've had a special and privileged life, yet it has been balanced by tragedy as it has been for so many others.","My childhood taught me nothing... zero.","When I was married, I didn't work. When I had my children, I didn't work. But before that, I'd work for Diana Vreeland at 'Harper's Bazaar.'","I think grieving is the same for everybody that lost someone you love deeply. It's the same. You know, you're really no different than anybody else who's lost somebody they adored.","I've always been interested in art, architecture, color.","I eat like a horse; sometimes I think I must have cancer.","If I see an orchid that's fantastically expensive, I'll buy it. It's worth it, for no other reason than it gives me pleasure.","I think there's nothing that makes you happier than to be really involved in something. I can't imagine a totally idle life.","Divorce is a 50-50 thing, and it can be a number of petty things that finally drive you out of your mind.","No, I never did hats. I didn't - never felt they were so becoming to me.","My mother endlessly told me I was too fat, that I wasn't a patch on my sister. It wasn't much fun growing up with her and her almost irrational social climbing in that huge house of my dull stepfather Hughdie Auchincloss in Washington.","It is difficult for someone raised in my world to learn to express emotion. We are taught early to hide our feelings publicly.","Onassis told me. He begged me to come to the wedding.","I feel like I'm in my own world: in the world but not a part of it.","When I was young, I used to think that everyone should die at 70.","I never saw a play with my mother until I was 14, and then it was 'Hansel and Gretel.'","My father, naturally, spoiled me when I was allowed to see him - flying to New York from Washington, alone, in those terrifying planes. He'd take me to Danny Kaye movies and rent a dog for me to walk in the park on Sunday - a different dog every Sunday - and then to have butterscotch sundaes with almonds at Schrafft's.","I find it hard to read people's minds, my own children's minds even harder. But it all worked out, and I was blessed with two wonderful children.","I've often thought - even though it's hard to give him even more credit than he has had - that Andy Warhol must have started a lot of 15 minutes of fame.","I'm obviously all for women's lib.","I like people like Andre Malraux, Edmund Wilson, Willa Cather, Robert Graves, Erik Erikson, and Francis Steegmuller.","I don't know where this myth that I go to a lot of parties stems from. It's a total myth. I may go out to something special once a year.","My ideal evening is to have dinner with one person or a few persons, and then be in bed by 11.","When I buy something, I do so with the intention of keeping it forever.","I'm constantly falling in love with objects, and they follow me around the world.","When I look back on my life, it seems nearly everything of interest happened in little more than one decade - dramas, tragedies, major events, pleasures, my close friendships with artists and political figures, the lovely places where I lived in England and New York, the trips to Europe, visits at the White House.","New Yorkers are obsessed with youth and eternal youth and then their careers and making money.","I don't know what happened, but I lost the desire to acquire more things. It's very peaceful to have lost that desire.","Paris is life-enhancing for all those reasons we know and all those words that have become so banal.","The most important thing, I've found, is to be self-reliant.","I think there's nothing that makes you happier than to be really involved in something.","I've always wanted to be an actress. At school and in college, I did some things. But then I married, and then I had children, and then there were the political years.","I hate touch football.","Taste is an emotion.","Paris is the most beautiful city in the world. It brings tears to your eyes.","Despite loving England and loving English gardens, I'm not a chintz person, never was. It's too cute.","I don't like dining rooms. I think they have too much structure and are too formal.","I have a great curiosity to see new things, but not to own them. It's very peaceful this way, and one of the nice things about getting older."],"Lee Remick":["I make movies for grownups. When Hollywood starts making them again, I'll start acting in them again.","You can compare me with Greta Garbo. I have big feet, too.","I'm not an oddball.","Breasts and bottoms look boringly alike. Faces, though, can be quite different and a damn sight more interesting!"],"Lee Rich":["Just because you're big doesn't mean you're going to be successful. The beauty of the motion picture business is that you can make a little movie like 'Driving Miss Daisy' or 'Rain Man' and go right through the roof. This business is still about creative juices, and size is no guarantee of that.","It's fine to do movies and say, 'We made big grosses,' but you've got to go back and ask, 'How much did it cost?' and 'Where do you make your profit?'","Extraneous violence is totally wrong. 'Robocop' was violence for violence's sake - you don't shoot somebody's arm off.","On a smash TV series, you make much more money than you ever can in a movie. Do you know how much more Bill Cosby will make than Spielberg? The money for successful television is unbelievable."],"Lee Ritenour":["I've done a lot of albums and I kinda know when I'm onto something that was inspirational for me to record and create, and this was one of those projects where I really enjoyed making the album.","I had redesigned my entire amplifier system for this tour because airlines are very strict now.","Arranging is the way I put my stamp on my music as much as my guitar playing.","Even though there are some great keyboard players on the album, there are a number of songs with no keyboard on them and the backing is all guitar oriented. This is first time I've ever done this actually.","I used a baritone guitar with a very unusual tuning that became the body of the composition, while the classical guitar is on top of it with the main rhythm part.","If you play the very subtle jazz tunes with acoustic pianos, acoustic bass and it's a dead standard, you are going to play very differently. It depends on the music.","My son Wesley has just turned 13. He was 12 during the recording of this record and he is quite a drummer already and has been studying drums since he was four, but he's also very interested in African percussion and studies percussion.","Well, Smoke n' Mirrors has very much a world music flavor and it doesn't park itself in one country. It borrows heavily from the Brazilian angle, which is dear to my heart, and I recorded several albums with that flavor.","I always love making albums. I'm passionate about it and it's something that's healthy for the soul and spirit.","In 2010, I had been playing guitar for 50 years.","I always recommend to any player to always compose their own music. It's one of the best things you can do to find a road to your own style.","Zamajobe is great. She's a terrific singer from South Africa."],"Lee Ryan":["I have a rude thought every three seconds!","I try to be kind to people, to treat them with respect. And I'm proud of that.","There is something really mysterious about lions. They could rip you apart if they wanted to, but at the same time they look so cuddly. Can you imagine what humans look like to animals? They must think we're so weird.","To be honest everything goes over my head a bit.","I haven't shaved my private parts, but I dyed them once for a laugh! They looked more ginger, though!","I still have imaginary friends who I talk to in my head.","My perfect girl would be pretty mad, but one you can have a conversation with. No one can be too mad for me, the madder the better. I love a crazy chick!","We know there's no use in getting miserable, so we go out on the town instead!","I think about dying a lot, every time I fall asleep on a train or a plane I expect to wake up to a crash!","I'm an expert at kissing girls necks, they love it. Girls say I'm quite sensitive, but I'm hyperactive too.","If I fancy a girl, I'll tell her. I'll say: 'You're fit.'","I was brought up with psychics and tarot cards. My mum was always told I was going to be in a boy band and be famous as a singer.","I've learnt a lot over the years, but I'm still quite outspoken. And no matter how much media training you put me through, I don't think I could be anything but.","When I was 6, I saw a commercial that Jessica Simpson was in, and that was the first time I felt my little heart flutter."],"Lee Scott":["We want to set a tone going into our fiscal year that starts Feb. 1, that Wal-Mart Stores is going to be aggressive in taking care of customers, taking care of our associates, communications and merchandising.","I just think that it's maybe fashionable today to try to take individual actions and individual failures and take the broadest possible brush and try to paint a company.","It's hard for us in our stores to be a leader in technology.","People aren't going to talk about it except me and that is communication and the visits I have personally had in our meetings with our store managers saying if you do these things you will be terminated, period.","I would guess that any criticism about Wal-Mart could have some element of truth with 1,500,000 people.","Where we have been incorrect in what we have done, then I think we have an obligation to settle.","Where we're not wrong or where the cost of settling is so much that it is totally disproportionate to the harm or the error that we made, we're not going to settle.","I think in some ways we have allowed other people to set the agenda. Other people to define who we are.","You know, we opened a record number of stores last year.","Retailing, it's always true that there is some items that I wish we had a lot more of like the iPod and there is some items I wish we had a lot less of.","More and more, more and more digital, in particular, I think you'll see in our stores next year, as we start combining these digital products and they interface with each other, you'll see that represented in Wal-Mart.","Our customer base is not necessarily a leader, an early adopter.","And the greeter is what sets the tone for this company and I've been on TV a little bit this morning.","And what I am trying to say to them that through our ads and through our discussions is if you don't want us in your community, that's your choice, but don't say it's because of wages.","Because the truth is our wages are really competitive and they're good.","Don't say it's because of benefits, because our benefits are good.","So I think we have an obligation with our size to make sure that we are open to what people have to say to us because the people who criticize us, they're not all mean-spirited.","Many of them are doing it because they are concerned about smart growth.","There are going to be some people who never want Wal-Mart. That's OK.","We've got to figure out a way to cause communities to also want them, the political, organized bodies.","The beauty of this country and what people participate in is the competitive nature that we allow to exist and the fact is that we are better because we have great competitors.","But they are also better, our competitors are better because Wal-Mart exists.","One of the things that strikes me is so many of the critics are people whose lifestyle doesn't change when the price of fuel changes, or if they keep a Wal-Mart store out of their area.","In some ways, people forget about average working people, and how they live their lives.","I expect that our associates will walk with a little more bounce in their step and understand that this company is behind them and has respect for them.","If we take care of the customers and associates and grow the business, Wall Street will be pleased.","I don't think we'll win every election."],"Lee Siegel":["I react very badly when mediocrity throws a tantrum of entitlement.","I am too childlike to be immature.","Every man is a hero to his alias.","I love the Internet; I'm on it all the time.","I love the idea of the amateur - that's what popular culture is all about. But what the Internet's doing is professionalizing everyone's amateuristic impulses.","Ever since the romantic comedy-drama 'She's Gotta Have It' antagonized black women and black men in 1986, Spike Lee's films have enjoyed the outrage of various groups.","Anonymity is a universal convention of the blogosphere, and the wicked expedience is that you can speak without consequences.","Everyone seems to be fleeing from the responsibilities that come from being who you are. I think that is why the blogosphere is thriving. It allows people to develop a fantasy self.","I have a confession to make. For years, I earned a living - or a sort of living - writing negative book reviews.","The Web critic relies on his or her readers for attentiveness and approval.","Instead of books, art, theatre, and music being consigned to specialized niches, we might have a criticism that better reflects the eclecticism of our time, a criticism that takes in various arts all at once.","In urban America, you do not so much meet a romantic partner as inherit the product of someone else's romantic crimes.","The sitcom's traditional role has been to comfort the viewer who feels burdened by the unreality of American expectations.","Oprah's aspiration to inspire her audience with hope - elaborated on her TV show, in her magazine, and on her website - is hardly ignoble.","In 1986, human nature in America started to change. That year, 'The Oprah Winfrey Show,' based in Chicago, became nationally syndicated, and the country entered the beginning stages of a quiet cultural revolution.","A single week of Oprah takes you from bondage to all the violent terrors of life, to escape through vicarious encounters with celebrity, to visions of charity and hope, to hard resolve, to redemption and moral renovation.","Every 'Oprah Winfrey Show' has about it the aura of Oprah's own life, just as the rituals and sacraments of a religion are suffused with the life of the religion's founder. Above the testimony of Oprah's guests hovers what viewers know about Oprah's experience.","'Hotel Rwanda' is an American product, not a Rwandan one, made primarily for American audiences.","It became inevitable that television would address life's mundane problems because television itself is so mundane, part of the ordinary flow of time the way those problems are.","Television has to reflect back to you your own sense of security. It also has to mirror your sense of your own decency and your own limitations.","The terrorist threat is so cloudy, faceless, and vague, so manipulable by political purposes, so definitely present but indefinitely manifested, that it sometimes feels interchangeable with everyday dread itself."],"Lee Smith":["People are so busy positioning themselves before the screen and talking on the damn cellphones, communicating, that we're not reading, and in fact we're not really communicating, either. We're not talking to each other. There's just all these screens and wires and technology in between.","I have always been interested in religion, especially in forms of ecstatic religion, where people are touched directly by the Spirit and go completely out of themselves.","For many of us, especially women, the gap between what we want or need and what our society expects of us is wide indeed, and we spend out lives trying to negotiate it. Trying to balance work and family, responsibilities and desires, all that stuff. It is not easy.","I had always dreamed of living in Chapel Hill. When I was a college student at Hollins University in Virginia, I came down to Chapel Hill for summer school and just loved it.","I write about people in small towns; I don't write about people living in big cities. My kind of storytelling depends upon people that have time to talk to each other.","I think what happens to young writers is that they use up every life experience that they have had up to that point for their first novel. Then you have to come up with something for the second novel, but you really don't have anything to say.","I am so sorry to see the state of reading in such decline. I think it says something really scary and terrible about us as a culture. I think it does have to do with everyone's total global embrace of technology.","I like a book. I like to read for four hours at a stretch. I think very few are the young people who are even capable of reading for four hours at a stretch, because it's such a bizarre thing for them to do. I am mourning this.","I think as the world changes, we have to keep up. We have to note what is happening, and I think writing has always had a powerful corrective influence and possibility. We have to write about what's good, and we also have to write about parts of our culture that are not good, that are not working out. I think it takes a new eye.","Born Virginia Marshall but nicknamed Gig, my mother was a home economics teacher who had come all the way across the whole state of Virginia, from her home on the Eastern Shore to our little Appalachian coal town to marry my daddy, Ernest Smith, whose family had lived in these mountains for generations.","Certainly I was a very religious child, a deeply weird and very emotional child, an only child with lots of imaginary friends and a very active imagination. I loved Sunday school and Bible camp and all that. I had my own white Bible with Jesus' words printed in red in the text; I even spoke at youth revivals.","I was raised in a little church, the Grundy Methodist Church, that was very straight-laced, but I had a friend whose mother spoke in tongues. I was just wild for this family. My own parents were older, and they were so over-protective. I just loved the 'letting go' that would happen when I went to church with my friend."],"Lee Smolin":["Science moves fastest when there's plenty of debate and controversy.","There certainly is a tension between the relativity of simultaneity and non-locality in quantum theory, but it's not strong enough to add up to a falsification of either side by itself.","If string theory is a mistake, it's not a trivial mistake. It's a deep mistake and therefore kind of worthy.","We know that the expansion of our universe is accelerating, which means a number called the cosmological constant must be positive.","Every string theory that's been written down says the speed of light is universal. But other ideas about quantum gravity predict the speed of light has actually increased.","How we think about the future and the past determines everything about how we think about our situation as human beings.","General relativity predicts that time ends inside black holes because the gravitational collapse squeezes matter to infinite density.","When we human beings hypothesize that a law of nature holds - even temporarily or situationally - we are creating an idea, but we are also making a hypothesis about how nature behaves, whose truth or usefulness has nothing to do with what we know or believe."],"Lee Strasberg":["The actor creates with his own flesh and blood all those things which all the arts try in some way to describe.","Acting isn't something you do. Instead of doing it, it occurs. If you're going to start with logic, you might as well give up. You can have conscious preparation, but you have unconscious results.","If we cannot see the possibility of greatness, how can we dream it?","Acting is the most personal of our crafts. The make-up of a human being - his physical, mental and emotional habits - influence his acting to a much greater extent than commonly recognized.","Art is longer than life.","An actors' tribute to me is in his work.","A great actor is independent of the poet, because the supreme essence of feeling does not reside in prose or in verse, but in the accent with which it is delivered."],"Lee Strobel":["My worldview, my philosophy, my attitudes, my relationships, my parenting, my marriage - everything has been transformed by my relationship with Christ.","Moral evil is the immorality and pain and suffering and tragedy that come because we choose to be selfish, arrogant, uncaring, hateful and abusive.","When you are in the midst of suffering you are looking for someone to be Jesus to you. You are looking for someone to love you and help take care of you, and reach out to you.","All Christians should be able to articulate reasons why they believe what they believe - not just for the sake of our spiritually confused friends, but also so that we ourselves will have a deeper and more confident faith.","There are Eastern religions that deny the reality of pain and suffering. They just try to wipe it away by saying it's all an illusion.","So much of the world's suffering results from the sinful action or inaction of ourselves and others. For example, people look at a famine and wonder where God is, but the world produces enough food for each person to have 3,000 calories a day. It's our own irresponsibility and self-centeredness that prevents people from getting fed.","If you define evolution as merely meaning change over time, then I don't see any problem with a person being a Christian and believing in evolution. But that's not how textbooks define evolution. They define evolution as being random and undirected without plan or purpose.","Christians can have doubts and they can have questions, and the unhealthy way to deal with that is to keep them inside where they fester and grow and can undermine our faith. The healthy way to deal with it is to talk about it and be honest about it.","I do know plenty of atheists, agnostics and skeptics who have become Christians through the years. In fact, several of my friends were once strong atheists but are now committed followers of Jesus.","It is very difficult to give a 15 second sound bite on why there is pain and suffering in this world and not have it come off as being flippant or surface level or superficial.","Intelligent design is consistent with any faith system I can think of, because most faith systems believe that there is a creator.","Apologetics has an important place in the local church as we seek to influence our communities for Christ in an increasingly skeptical culture.","Christianity is a very historical religion - it makes specific claims that are open to testing.","I am primarily a writer of books, and I enjoy that. But I come to realize that a lot of people prefer a visual medium.","I think it's very healthy to use journalistic and legal techniques to investigate the evidence for and against Christianity and other faith systems.","A lot of people don't give much thought to what they believe, and it's easy for them to hold what often are two conflicting ideas in their head at the same time.","I certainly believe that God did create the world, yeah, absolutely I believe that.","Nobody is beyond the reach of the Gospel.","The Internet has helped atheists and agnostics coalesce as never before.","Virtually every scientist now concedes that universe and time itself had beginning. So, whatever begins to exist has a cause. The universe began to exist. Therefore, the universe must have had a cause."],"Lee Tamahori":["Always be original. Never duplicate what you've seen another actor do. Be true to the character that you've been given, and the rest will come easy.","Sex should not be in the movies and should be in the home, and violence should be in the movies and not in the home.","I've always loved the Bond pictures. I have watched every single one. Movies don't get bigger or better than Bond, so I knew this was my opportunity to do a massive action picture with outrageous stunts.","A Bond movie falls into a specific genre, and you have to provide certain elements. You must respect the fact it's essentially about girls, guns, gadgets, and big action."],"Lee Tergesen":["Eddie Drake is sort of this loose cannon, funny, edgy guy, who has this really foolish, foolish mustache.","It's definitely intense to walk away from at the end of each season.","I would say that playing this character has caused me to think about a lot of things. He's always questioning himself and trying to get back to something he lost touch with and trying to find forgiveness. Everybody struggles with these things to some extent in their life.","I think for Beecher specifically, Keller was with him when his wife died. Beecher had decided after he first got into prison that he had to shut off everybody. You can't let anybody in and you have to become like them and you have to be threatening and all that.","What it made me realize was that a show like this makes people look inside themselves. Because this crew guy isn't sitting there wishing the character would fight back. He's hoping that he would fight back.","But we both came to the decision that the powerful thing is to go into your fear, walk in there with it, don't walk away from it, and to try to be true to it.","As I walk around, I have met 70-year-old women who live on the Upper West Side who love the show. And I met a couple in Kansas - a couple of truck drivers who drove around together - who loved it. It's popular all over the place and definitely in the gay community.","I know what it's like to be ignored, and I think that is the big problem about the prison system: These people are being thrown away. There is no sense of rehabilitation. In some places, they are trying to do things. But, in most cases, it's a holding cell.","I have always said about myself I am a survivor because I am.","I went through a divorce right as we were starting the show. My divorce became final right after we started shooting the first year, and during that time I was in such a low place."],"Lee Thompson Young":["It's always a really great feeling when I talk to people who watched 'Jett Jackson' because we were the same age. We were all kids. I was 13 when I started working on that show, and that was part of my childhood.","College and the responsibilities that came with it helped me transition from teenager to adulthood.","Photography is a hobby born out of my time in undergrad at USC. It is more of a pleasurable hobby, a stress reliever. I don't consider it a professional endeavor like acting or directing."],"Lee Trevino":["Sure, I've felt racism. I think everybody has prejudice. When I was growing up, the dark Mexican kids weren't allowed in the public swimming pool in Dallas. My light-skinned friend got in, and he laughed at us. It didn't seem like a big deal, because we didn't know any different. So I never ran into anything that actually scarred me.","If you are caught on a golf course during a storm and are afraid of lightning, hold up a 1-iron. Not even God can hit a 1-iron.","My divorce came to me as a complete surprise. That's what happens when you haven't been home in eighteen years.","Yes, I think I have the best swing on the Tour. Why have scores comedown in the last ten years? Partly because they are imitating me.","In case of a thunderstorm, stand in the middle of the fairway and hold up a one iron. Not even God can hit a one iron.","I met Jesse Owens once. He was a remarkable individual, and I have tremendous respect for what he did in the Olympics under the circumstances.","My point is, there's no sense trying to squeeze something out of your swing if you can let your clubs do the shotmaking for you.","No one who ever had lessons would have a swing like mine.","I believe in reincarnation. In my last life I was a peasant. Next time around, I'd like to be an eagle. Who hasn't dreamed they could fly? They're a protected species, too.","Living in Dallas, I root for the Mavericks and the Stars and the Cowboys, but I've always pulled for the Chicago Cubs. I enjoy watching them play.","I'm not scared of very much. I've been hit by lightning and been in the Marine Corps for four years.","Pressure is when you play for five dollars a hole with only two in your pocket.","My wife doesn't care what I do when I'm away, as long as I don't have a good time.","There is no such thing as natural touch. Touch is something you create by hitting millions of golf balls.","I still sweat. My guts are still grinding out there. Sometimes I have enough cotton in my mouth to knit a sweater.","How can they beat me? I've been struck by lightning, had two back operations, and been divorced twice.","Only bad golfers are lucky. They're the ones bouncing balls off trees, curbs, turtles and cars. Good golfers have bad luck. When you hit the ball straight, a funny bounce is bound to be unlucky.","I'm not out there just to be dancing around. I expect to win every time I tee up.","One of the nice things about the Senior Tour is that we can take a cart and cooler. If your game is not going well, you can always have a picnic.","I keep lot of my opinions to myself. My grandfather, who was a gravedigger, told me one day, 'Son, the next time you go by the cemetery, remember that a third of the people are in there because they got into other people's business.'","I'm actually a very quiet person off the golf course. I talk 150 miles per hour when I'm at the course, but when in private I very seldom ever open my mouth.","The most interesting guy I've ever played with was King Hassan of Morocco. I went over there on a trip in the early 1970s, and the King and I played five holes. I've never been that nervous in my life.","When you're poor, you know nothing about the future, you know nothing about the world, nothing that goes on outside 300 yards around you.","Pressure is playing for ten dollars when you don't have a dime in your pocket.","Every shot feels like the first shot of the day. If I'm on the range hitting shot after shot, I can hit them just as good as I did when I was 30. But out on the course, your body changes between shots. You get out of the cart, and you've got this 170-yard 5-iron over a bunker, and it goes about 138.","You can make a lot of money in this game. Just ask my ex-wives. Both of them are so rich that neither of their husbands work.","Chi Chi Rodriguez had as good a pair of hands as anybody I ever saw, and more shots than you can imagine. But Chi Chi had a habit of turning simple shots into difficult ones.","When it comes to the game of life, I figure I've played the whole course.","Nobody but you and your caddie care what you do out there, and if your caddie is betting against you, he doesn't care, either.","I never think of yesterday. Can't do anything about it. I'm a positive guy. When you really deep down look at it, we go to bed every night, get up every morning, stay here for 70 or 80 years, and then we die.","I will fall in love with any golf course that you have to drive the ball straight. You understand what I'm saying? That's my advantage. My advantage wasn't putting. In fact, I wasn't even a great putter or a good putter.","I always loved hitting a low fade to a back-right pin with the wind howling from the right. Not many guys could get it close in that situation, because they kept it low by just putting the ball back in their stance. You see, playing the ball back turns you into a one-trick pony - you can only hit hooks.","A hungry dog hunts best.","You can talk to a fade but a hook won't listen.","I think a lot of Jim Thorpe, the Olympian, and his accomplishments.","Michael Jordan was a tremendous basketball player.","I use an Arnold Palmer putter that was probably built back in 1954.","I have an orthopedic pillow that's made out of a sponge material. I have a plate in my throat, and I have to be careful or I could end up with a bad neck in the morning. That pillow is a must everywhere I go.","I've traveled the world and been about everywhere you can imagine. There's not anything I'm scared of except my wife.","I stay away from the telephone if at all possible.","I've played golf with three U.S presidents.","I never played much golf as a kid. I caddied quite a bit but never got serious into golf until about age 15.","If I could do anything over, I'd have spent more time with my first set of children. I would have taken more quality time with them, for sure.","I adore the game of golf. I won't ever retire.","Golf isn't just my business, it's my hobby.","The older I get the better I used to be!","Putts get real difficult the day they hand out the money.","His nerve, his memory, and I can't remember the third thing.","There are two things that won't last long in this world, and that's dogs chasing cars and pros putting for pars.","I'm going to win so much money this year, my caddie will make the top twenty money winner's list.","I never think of yesterday. Can't do anything about it.","When you really deep down look at it, we go to bed every night, get up every morning, stay here for 70 or 80 years, and then we die.","All my life I had a rapport with black caddies.","I keep lot of my opinions to myself.","If your concentration is getting bad, take up bass fishing. It will really improve your ability to focus. If you aren't ready when that fish hits, you can't set the hook.","I love watching Anthony Kim play, but I'm not a fan of the way he grips down a good two inches on his full-swing shots. Choking down lightens the club's swingweight and effectively makes the shaft stiffer.","Jack Nicklaus liked to curve the ball by opening or closing the clubface at address. I never felt I was good enough to do it his way. I didn't like changing my swing path, either, which some guys do.","Green synthetic practice mats are the worst thing for your golf game that I know of. You can hit six inches behind the ball and not even know it, because the ball still gets airborne. Practice nets are awful, too. Swing a weighted club instead.","You can't teach passion. You can teach everything else.","I just feel like I have when I started making a lot of money, I started spreading it out to people. Mickelson, the whole deal, the over-tip: if I see a guy that looks like he needs a hand out or something, I'll pull something out and give him something.","I remember the first time going to St. Jude. I didn't like going there because the children were ill, and it just broke my heart. It makes you test your religion when you see something like that. But the Lord doesn't want just old people. You know, He wants some young people, too, and good people. He takes care of them. He takes care of them.","Jack Nicklaus liked to curve the ball by opening or closing the clubface at address. I never felt I was good enough to do it his way. I didn't like changing my swing path, either, which some guys do. There's only one really reliable way to curve the ball: Change your hand position at address.","I love watching Anthony Kim play, but I'm not a fan of the way he grips down a good two inches on his full-swing shots. Choking down lightens the club's swing weight and effectively makes the shaft stiffer. It also makes it difficult to hit the ball high enough for all situations.","Seve Ballesteros was the best trouble-shot player who ever lived. It didn't matter how far in the woods you put that guy, he'd find a way to get out. But Seve inadvertently put a lot of big numbers on the scorecards of average players, because he inspired them to take dumb chances."],"Lee Unkrich":["I didn't want to be the guy who screwed up 'Toy Story.'","When we were making 'Toy Story,' my grandmother was very ill, and she knew she was not going to make it. I went back to visit her, and there was a moment during that visit that I had to say goodbye, and I knew I'd never be seeing her again. I looked at her and knew that I was looking at her for the last time.","I'm lucky to be surrounded by incredibly talented people at Pixar, of course, and I learn a lot from them each and every day.","If you look at the beginning of children's entertainment in literature, the first books that were written for kids were cautionary tales. They were books that were there to teach kids about growing up and how to live life.","It wasn't the first film to show a kind of alternate vision of suburbia, but it left an indelible impression, I think, on everybody, and all films like that will forever be measured against 'Blue Velvet.'","When you think about it, the most important thing to a toy is to be played with by a child, and anything that keeps them from being played with gives them stress - things like getting lost, getting broken.","It's an incredible honor to be nominated by the Academy.","The walls between live-action and animation are becoming really porous, and it's interesting.","Going through the Chagrin Falls school system, I always thought I was going off to art school.","How about a good comedy? 'Raising Arizona.' Remains the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life.","My favorite film is 'The Shining,' mostly because it was the film that inspired me to become a filmmaker myself.","Every one of us at Pixar is worried that we're going to be the one to make the dud.","After we finished 'Toy Story 2,' we talked about going right into making 'Toy Story 3,' because we had an idea that we thought had some promise. But there were a bunch of boring contractual problems going on between Disney and Pixar at the time that kept us from making the movie.","Do you ever achieve total forgiveness after screwing up?","I guess it's the fear of failure and not knowing how the films are going to do that just drives us to work really hard to make them the best they can possibly be.","For anyone who's had a transition in their life - heading off to college, parents sending their kids off to college, people getting out of college and heading off into the workforce. Those are major transitions.","I looked long and hard at third films in series to see if there were any good ones that I could learn from. And there weren't any that hadn't just gone off the train tracks by their third film. Until, that is, I got to the third 'Lord of the Rings' film.","It is shocking how much a day-care center is like a prison. They both have security cameras with walled exercise yards. Prisons are permanent day cares for people permanently in time-out - convicts.","Finding a good kid actor is like finding a needle in a massive haystack.","When people think of Mexican music, they most often think of mariachi, and that, of course, is one part.","For 'Toy Story 3' to be recognized by the Academy as not only one of the best animated films of the year, but also as one of the 10 best pictures of the year, is both humbling and overwhelming.","The best way to bring people in and have them empathize with others is through storytelling.","If we can tell a good story with characters audiences can care about, I'd like to think that prejudices can fall aside and people can just experience the story and these characters for the human beings that they are.","I really personalized the pressure to make a good 'Toy Story' film. It made me physically sick at the beginning. Literally, I wanted to throw up in the morning because I was just so racked with stress.","One of the tricky things with animation is, because we spend four years on the movie and everything is done so methodically day by day by day, it can be a struggle to have the finished film feel spontaneous and loose and naturally occurring.","I love movies that are funny and scary and truly emotional all in one film, and I don't feel like I see movies like that a lot.","'Coco' is shaping up to be one of the most beautiful films we've made.","I saw a lot of movies that I probably shouldn't have seen. I saw 'Dog Day Afternoon' when I was in first grade - that kind of thing.","I ended up being exposed to cinema that a lot of other kids wouldn't have been exposed to.","When I was around 12 or so, I saw 'The Shining.' I just remember that being a turning point for me, where I started to think about the fact that there was a hand behind the film. That it wasn't just this magical story being told - there were actual people crafting these films, and they were works of art.","Typically in animation, the characters exist in a kind of stasis. Look at 'The Simpsons' - they never age, the baby never grows up - or 'Peanuts' - the kids never grow up, they always stay the same age.","We know that families and kids are going to be an important part of our audience, so we've always made sure that we've picked subject matter that was appropriate for kids. But I think if you try to target a movie to kids, you're going to fail.","Everyone looks at our films and thinks that we are somehow able to make movie after movie that does well and is entertaining, but there's an enormous amount of work that goes on under the hood and an enormous number of mistakes that are made along the way.","We could make the most beautiful film in the world, but if it doesn't have a heart beating underneath it, then no one's going to be interested.","We go to movies to be taken away to another place, to be dazzled, to dream, to hopefully be filled with wonder. The design of the world and the look of the film is all in service of trying to create that feeling of wonder in the audience.","We try our best every time to make engaging films that we're interested in, and we just hope the rest of the world likes them.","Live action movies are someone else's story. With animation, audiences can't think that. Their guards are down.","I never wanted 'Toy Story 3' to feel like another sequel just grafted on. We all know that if you put 3 after your title, it typically means garbage, and we knew that going in.","The only reason we made 'Toy Story 2' is that we happened to come up with a storyline that was really good. It wasn't driven by wanting to make a sequel.","Initially, when people asked us when 'Toy Story 2' was going to come out, we'd say, 'We have no interest in sequels. We just want to do original stories.'","In the earliest days of Pixar, when we were making 'Toy Story' and 'A Bug's Life,' we all came together as a group.","I grew up loving watching movies, and at a certain point, I started to become fascinated with making movies. Then I went to film school, and I got to dabble with different aspects of moviemaking, and I ended up settling heavily into editing - editing was what I was really adept at, had a passion for.","I had worked for a lot of directors whose work I didn't respect, and as I was editing material, I was thinking about how I would have shot the scenes and what I would have done to make the scenes better. After several years of that, I got to the point that I was pretty confident I could sit in the director's chair.","I'd really love to watch David Lynch work, to be a fly on the wall.","I love Giuseppe Tornatore, the guy that did 'Cinema Paradiso.'","Any of us directing at Pixar, whether it's our first time or not, feel a lot of pressure to not make a bad Pixar film.","People loved the first two 'Toy Story' films so much, and the last thing I wanted to do was make a disappointing third film.","With the first 'Toy Story,' we didn't know what the hell we were doing. We'd never made a movie before, so we went down a lot of blind alleys along the way. We went through seven different writers before we finally settled into our groove.","It's a strange business, and unfortunately, what we do in animation is a mystery, especially the directors.","The question I get more than any other is, 'What does it mean to direct an animated film?' And the reality is that it's not a whole lot different from what you do in live action.","I was disappointed that 'Tangled' didn't get nominated for Best Animated Film.","I don't like 3D movies that have things popping out of the screen. Firstly, I find it straining on my eyes, and more importantly, it distracts me from the movie.","I feel like my job as a storyteller and director is to create an experience where the audience forgets they're in a cinema and can get lost in the story. Things popping out of the screen call attention to the artifice of what you're doing, so I use 3D as more of a window into a world behind the screen.","I love that people are still obsessively trying to understand and decode 'The Shining.' People want to find meaning in things that seemingly don't have meaning on the surface.","If you ask any of us which movie we were making when one of our kids was born, we'll be able to tell you instantly. It's like our family lives are permanently woven into the movies.","You can be stuck for two weeks on a problem, and then you get the right couple of people in a room, and in five minutes, you get a great answer.","I just ended up focusing on film editing as I was getting my career started. I'm very passionate about editing and will continue to edit for the rest of my career, but it's not like that was all I did and then somehow I grew into directing a movie.","I did direct quite a bit when I was in school, and I directed some television afterwards.","The world does not want to see a Pixar film that's not great.","I think the moment you try to make something for kids, you are making something really cruddy that even kids don't want to watch most of the time.","When we made 'Toy Story,' journalists were more interested in talking about the technique because it was so new and unknown, and we just wanted to talk about the story.","We all, to some degree, wish we could have some element of our childhood back again while, for kids, moving on is something they're worried about. They know it's going to happen at some point.","It's important that nobody gets mad at you for screwing up. We know screwups are an essential part of making something good.","If I went back to live-action, I'd have to do it the Pixar way. If I didn't, I'd feel like I was walking a tightrope without a net.","I know I'm going to send my three kids off to college someday. I know my parents will pass away someday. It's one thing to say, 'I'll be able to deal with that day when it comes,' and it's another thing to find yourself at that day, dealing with it.","Pixar is filled with people who don't get rid of their toys.","When we made 'Toy Story,' we knew, even back then, that this was going to be the ugliest film we would ever produce.","We hope 'Toy Story 3' looks amazing but still retains the character design of the first film. I like to think it looks like 'Toy Story' would have looked back then had we had the skills and the technology.","We got together as a group to come up with the idea for 'Toy Story 3' in the same cabin where we dreamed up 'Toy Story.'","People talk a lot about Pixar going off the rails. A lot of people are saying they aren't happy that we are making sequels. But for every one of those people, there is one that is happy because they fell in love with the worlds we created. We hope we've proved that a sequel can be every bit as enjoyable as the original."],"Lee Van Cleef":["Being born with a pair of beady eyes was the best thing that ever happened to me.","Bad guys have always been my bag... I look mean without even trying.","Audiences just naturally hate me on screen. I could play a role in a tuxedo, and people would think I was rotten. You can do much more with a villain part.","Movies are full of leading men, most of whom aren't working. It's much harder to find a good villain."],"Lee Westwood":["I'm working my way steadily back and I'm feeling good.","Just because I keep getting close and don't win these Majors, I must not panic.","No, I don't have any problems leaving disappointments behind. I've had lots of good days at golf and a few disappointments, so you never know what's around the corner.","It's such a psychological and mental game, golf, that the smallest wrong thing at the wrong time can distract you from what you're trying to achieve.","My dad said: 'It looks like you'll be world No.1 in a few hours and I wanted to be the first to say congratulations.'","Sometimes Americans don't quite get my sense of humor. My good ol' British sarcasm seems to go over their heads.","People always say golfers don't smile. But there is so much psychology in golf so we have to be a bit robotic.","I'm a golfer - not an athlete.","You don't win tournaments by playing well and thinking poorly.","Race horses are like golfers, you're never sure how they're going to come out of the stalls. It's just - hopefully the horses come out of the race all right, just fit and ready to go again in the near future, but 3rd was good. It's paid for its hay.","The Singapore Open is the flagship event of the Asian Tour, it is a massive event and it is being played in a great place. I love coming here and it is good to be back.","Probably the best caddies are the smartest ones and the ones that are switched on mentally more than some of the others maybe.","In my case what happened next in 1999 was that I fell apart over that back nine. When I saw I was in genuine contention that year I felt like throwing up. That remains probably the most nervous I've ever been on a golf course.","Yeah, I feel good. Good about my game and my life.","I'm heavier, but with muscle rather than flab. It's a massive difference. It means I don't get as tired sometimes and it means that I'm hitting the ball a lot farther, about 15 yards more with my driver.","Eighteen months ago I weighed 95kg and had a 40-inch waist. Now the waist is down to 34 inches and I weigh nearly 98kg.","I'm the best in the world.","Listen, everything I did in my childhood was competitive. Everything we did my dad made it into a game to win. We used to drive my mum nuts.","The satisfaction you get when you finally beat your dad is amazing, that rush of adrenaline.","The story of the week is you have got to putt well to win the Masters and I haven't putted well.","I never take myself too seriously.","Golf is difficult to get your personality over because you are such a bottle of concentration.","Golf is played between the ears and if you are not 100 percent focused on what you are trying to do, then people will go past you no matter who you are.","People confuse being world No. 1 with winning a Major championship.","Yes, a Major would mean so much to me but I'm a great believer that if you work hard and in the right way, you will get what you deserve.","I'm 37, I'm pretty fit and feel I have another eight years left - which means there's 32 Majors still to go at.","Yeah, two or three weeks ago I was fairly snappy. I've never been injured before and this year it feels like I've hardly played.","I ruptured my plantaris muscle. It runs through the calf and goes down the side of your achilles and stretches right to the heel.","I've said before that the Ryder Cup is not the European Tour versus the American Tour. It's Europe's best golfers against the US.","I know I'm good enough to contend in each and every major I play.","I've started to show the consistency in majors I had in regular tournaments back in 1998-2000 when I was contending nearly every week.","Now I'm giving up a little in the week-to-week tournaments but reaping the benefits in the majors.","I'm hitting it better than last year. The putting is getting close now, too.","You're the only one in control over your golf ball. It's not like tennis: you're hitting a shot and somebody's hitting it back at you.","People mature at different stages and I feel I'm learning a lot.","Even when I finished third at the U.S. Open a few weeks back, I didn't putt very well, nor in the last round of last year's Masters when Mickelson won, nor last year's Open at Turnberry, where I came second."],"Lee Whitnum":["Zionists believe they are entitled by God to the land, groves and homes of the non-Jewish underclass. They quote the Bible as the reference that 'God gave them the land.'

All I do, all the time, with everybody, is tell them what I am thinking, what I am feeling.","If only I could find a guy who wasn't in his 70s to talk to me about white cranes, I'd be madly in love.","I think when you're doing a lead role, there is so much more pressure. If you fail, not only do you fail, but everybody else fails, too. As opposed to when it's a supporting role and it's only you that sucked.","I did try to get a few of those teen high-school movies, but they just didn't like me. I guess I wasn't a certain type.","This girl at 17 really led an army, this girl at 19 really burned at the stake by her own choice. And you sit there and you want to figure out why did she make these choices? How did she live such a life?","Honestly, ever since I've been married, the part of a job as an actress where you have to kiss other people, I find totally bizarre.","I've never played anybody like a cop before.","I've never scratched, or punched, or slapped anybody in my real life.","I heard someone say the other day that they thought it was sexier to call someone their fiance instead of their husband or wife.","I guess because it feels more open, but I think being married is way sexier, because it's really like your soul partner in a permanent fashion, and then you strive for it to be something permanent, and that type of commitment and trust, if you can achieve it, is so good for the soul.","I go short and sweet on the engagement. I did have a longish engagement, but I think short and sweet is best.","I, like many people, am constantly on my phone.","When I had my daughter, Louisanna, two and a half years ago, I started recording every funny or sweet thing she said or did on my phone.","I text my girlfriends. I look at Facebook. I check my e-mail. If I'm away from the news cycle more than a few hours, I feel out of touch.","Now when I see something beautiful or funny or sweet, sometimes I reach for my camera, but other times I think, 'I need to let this moment exist. I don't have to capture everything. I just want to experience it.'","I always get scared of traffic cops when I'm driving, like I freak out even when I'm not doing anything wrong. I still think they're going to pull me over and arrest me.","I think people really don't like cops so much; they're kind of rude to them or treat them like they can't see them.","I'm open to whatever is meant to be, it will be."],"Leeza Gibbons":["I'm giving life lessons and tips on how to take care of your emotional heart, because heart disease is the number-one killer in America.","Caring for an Alzheimer's patient is a situation that can utterly consume the lives and well-being of the people giving care, just as the disorder consumes its victims.","Alzheimer's caregivers are heroes.","I've seen the power of Life Coaching firsthand and I know how beneficial it can be.","When you compete with good people, it makes everybody better.","If caregivers are not healthy, mentally well-balanced and spiritually sound, then those for whom they care will suffer.","Both organizations are growing rapidly due in part to answering the urgent need in the community for services and programs to help with the day-to-day struggles that come with memory disorders.","There's a terrible price to pay for stress in your life - it really takes a hit on your heart.","Anybody who's serious about their passion in life gets doors slammed in their face, literally and figuratively.","I was a middle child and was used to negotiating.

Then, if you can still inject a little bit of something worthwhile, you have done as much as can be expected.","When I write a novel, I am God at my own typewriter, and there is nobody in between.

I don't know what happened to my Dodgers.","I have to say that it was a very strange experience when, later in life, I represented Byron Scott and was negotiating with West - whose picture I used to have over my bed! That took some getting used to.","But the truth is, growing up in California, we knew nothing about hockey.","The NFL today has bigger, stronger, bodies than ever, moving faster than ever, hitting a stationary object harder than ever before - so the physics of the hit have changed.","But the equipment to protect the players hasn't developed along with that, so now you have more players out with worse injuries, for longer periods of time.","As for football in L.A., it's going to take a loooong time before another team comes here.","Now we're getting a whole generation of kids who have never had a football team in L.A., so they don't miss it and don't ask for it. It becomes self-perpetuating. They don't know what they're missing.","Hey, our Founding Fathers wore long hair and powdered wigs - I don't see anybody trying to look like them today, either... But we do look to them as role models.","Cameron was able to get an inside look at professional football from the standpoint of athletes and agents and general managers that few people have ever seen.","Forty years ago the chances of journalists reporting - or the authorities even prosecuting - a pro athlete were practically nil.","We're all negotiators.","It's learning how to negotiate to keep both sides happy - whether it's for a multi-million dollar contract or just which show to watch on TV, that determines the quality and enjoyment of our lives.","School gives you the freedom to explore different philosophies, religions, aspects of yourself, and subjects.","I just knew that economics had never been my big motivation.","We live in a niche world.","We can always find creative ways to do things.","The Super Bowl is like a movie, and the quarterback is the leading man."],"Leigh-Allyn Baker":["I know a lot of actors picture themselves winning Academy Awards. I really just wanted to do a Christmas movie because it's the kind of movie that I really love to watch. I'm a sucker for the holidays.","Our traditions have been waking up on Christmas morning and feasting on a southern breakfast. I'm from the South. We eat grits and biscuits and gravy and eggs with Ritz crackers and country ham, bacon, you name it.","I was named after my two uncles. Roger Lee and Richard Allen. They simply changed the spelling to Leigh-Allyn to make it more feminine.","Even though I would love a little girl for me, personally, I love being a mom to boys.","I certainly know what it is like to go to work and leave your baby at home. It is an ache that only other mothers can understand. I always say that it feels like you've left a limb at home. And I really struggled for the first few months of work. There were times when I shut myself in my room and cried.","'Having it all' is such an intimidating concept. Just when you think you have all those plates spinning perfectly... something changes. It is a constant balancing act.","I've learned that the perfect picture that I hold in my mind of what my life looks like is constantly changing, growing, evolving. I remind myself that I am exactly where I need to be in my life; otherwise, I would surely be somewhere else.","I have a quick shout out to all the moms... I know it's hard, but try to love your body after baby.","If you're an actress, you're always on one diet or another - it's a way of life."],"Leighton Meester":["I look up to my mom. She's a beautiful woman.","I'm so accustomed to being alone.","Even when people are so judgmental about what you wear or your weight you just have to step away and be like, 'I'm a normal, fine human being.'","I didn't really like modeling; it was fun but I always wanted acting.","Sometimes you're a little too close for comfort, and I think anybody can relate to that, whether you're in college or just moving out on your own.","I've never fallen in love right off the bat. I get scared to say I love you too soon because it means so much. It means you're not seeing an end to things.","When I do get free time, I spend a lot of it at home with my family and my close friends and I think that's what keeps me happy, healthy, grounded, and totally in check.","I've never been crazy. I'm a very good girl, to be honest. I don't do anything to hurt anybody.","Everyone has this universal understanding of roommate drama.","Daily life shouldn't be a fashion show all the time.","When you see how you react when you suffer that's when you know what you are made of.","I love live music and I love to see people's faces when I'm performing.","I think you have to know how you feel when you're sad and it's healthy to mourn if a relationship ends.","I used to drink tons of caffeine. Now I make smoothies with frozen berries and Green Vibrance health powder.","The way I become friends with somebody is a slow process. You can't just spill your guts and tell them everything about yourself and expect them to listen and understand you because you don't know them. It's the same thing with a relationship.","You can take what is handed to you and use it as an excuse to mess up. But I've always handled what was given to me by life. I consider myself lucky. I was never lied to. And I was loved.","You know how you're supposed to choose between playing up your eyes or your lips? I always choose lips. I love the drama.","It's wonderful to be in love. And it's definitely wonderful to cuddle and have sex and get to experience life with somebody. But it's OK if you don't find him and you're 24. You can find it someday.","Singing really is acting. In a lot of ways, it's much more personal. I love music, and being able to work on that is amazing.","I think guys who are rebels and make their own rules are appealing.","I haven't ever really relied on relationships with guys. They come around and it's cool, but it's never been a big thing. I guess I've just been really distracted by work.","Guys who are unavailable are actually a dream come true for me because I'm unavailable all the time. It's great they're not down your throat.","I'm not really a partier, in general. I've definitely learned that that's probably the least interesting thing you can do with your time.","I want a family someday and I know that I have to let love in to create that and I think there is someone out there for me, but I'm not on some crazy hunt for that right now.","I never wear makeup when I'm not at work. It can make you forget what you look like, and I've grown to really love the way I look without it.","I watched a lot of TV, and it clicked one day that these people were acting. It sounded like the most fun thing ever.","In this world, everyone wants to know everything about you, and I think that's funny.","Any fear of aging, I think, is simply vanity.","If you get a wrinkle, I don't feel that's indicative of your losing ground. That's ridiculous.","Honestly, all I ever do is work.","People are pretty respectful for the most part.","I love my parents very much, but people either continue or break the patterns of what their life should be and I just want to completely break whatever patterns would lead me to the same life choices that they made.","I never played sports. I wasn't any good at them.","I couldn't relate to kid stuff. 'Jimmy doesn't like me!' Who cares? I was worried we didn't have gas money or food. Those were my concerns.","I don't know if it'd be any time soon but I'd really like to work on a collaboration with somebody - I always have ideas for stuff like that.","I really like to be able to have variety and to try different things - that's the beauty of fashion.","I've gotten to wear such beautiful clothes and had such a variety and it's just been so nice because I feel like I've grown so much with my style and everything because I've been able to have fun with it. It's really fun for me.","I remember looking through magazines or watching movies even just a couple of years ago and being like, 'I really want to be part of that,' but not realizing what that was.","I couldn't be happier.","In real life I've learned to love not wearing any makeup whatsoever, and I'm super low-maintenance when it comes to my hair.","I always change my hair, but I don't like haircuts!","I've been so blessed to work with the people I have.","I grew up reading 'Sense and Sensibility' and 'Pride and Prejudice' - girly kind of books.","I love Edith Wharton. And I love old New York. Anything to do with New York.","High school for me was not all that fun. I think it's a lot more fun after when you realize that high school ends, and everything that's important at that time is sort of not important if people don't like your jeans or whatever. It doesn't matter.","I'm not sure I ever want to get married.","The only time a relationship is good is when you really love them.","I don't want to hang out with some guy I just like.","It's hard to have any kind of luck in this business.","I like to be judged by my family and friends because they know me.","I'm a grown woman and sometimes, I might be a little fat, you know? Am I alone there? Not really.","A nutritionist helps me eat healthily at home.","I feel more mature than most people my age.","I've been through a lot as far as love.","When I'm singing a song, I picture somebody in particular. A lot of it is to a guy.","I don't want to have a friend unless I can call them one of my best friends.","I had a bunch of different hair colors. I was experimenting to see what I liked. It started off brown, then I did red, then I got really, really blonde!","I feel like my friends are in a cult because we're like, 'No outsiders!","I've learned to let things roll off my back.","I just go at my own pace and I like control of the TV and I like to decide when I take a shower and wash the dishes and stuff like that. So I don't know who would want to live with me to be honest!","I want an identity outside of my work.","I do so much work that I don't have a lot of time for my life!","I don't even think about fame at all.","I believe in love, children and being a good person.","When I don't have to be at work, I want to be the real me - the comfortable me!"],"Leila Aboulela":["I was 24 years old and stuck in a strange place with two boisterous little boys, and my husband was working offshore on the oil rigs. It was a life for which I wasn't prepared.","I'm concerned that Islam has not just been politicised but that it's becoming an identity. This is like turning religion into a football match; it's a distraction from the real thing.","I grew up in a very westernised environment and went to a private American school. But my personality was shy and quiet, and I wanted to wear the hijab but didn't have the courage, as I knew my friends would talk me out of it.","It was 1989, and the word 'Muslim' wasn't even really used in Britain at the time; you were either black or Asian.","That's what religion teaches: that life is a temporary thing which is going to dissolve one day.","Sudan is not Arab enough for Arabs and not African enough for Africans.","My characters are not role-model Muslims, but they struggle to make choices using Muslim logic.","I wasn't trained to write non-fiction.","I read a lot of fiction.","My father married out of the family. I also married outside the family.","When you write about a Muslim woman, like I did with my previous novels - 'Minaret', for example, which is about a woman who starts to wear the hijab - it sets all the alarm bells ringing.","The coverage of Islam in the media is becoming more sophisticated, and there is more access to knowledge.","Many Arabic/Islamic words have now entered the English dictionary, such as haj, hijab, Eid, etc., and I no longer need to put them in italics or explain them.","When I was growing up, we spoke Egyptian, we ate Egyptian food, we had other Egyptian friends. It was my father's preference.","My mum and dad were speaking all the time about, 'In Sudan we do this,' and 'In Egypt we do that,' so I was very aware of cultural differences. I was confused growing up; it gave me a feeling of being an outsider watching others. But I think this is good for a writer.","I started creative writing classes at Aberdeen Central Library, and the writer-in-residence there, Todd McEwen, encouraged me a great deal. He showed my stories to his editor, and I thought that was just what happened to everyone who took his classes!","I write fiction that reflects Islamic logic: fictional worlds where cause and effect are governed by Muslim rationale. However, my characters do not necessarily behave as 'good' Muslims; they are not ideals or role models.","My faith was started off by my grandmother and mother, and so I always saw it as a very private, personal thing.","My grandmother studied medicine in the Forties, which was very rare in Egypt, and my mother was a university professor, so my idea of religion wasn't about a woman not working or having to dress in a certain way; it was more to do with the faith."],"Leila Bekhti":["I'm a big fan of Scandinavian series like 'Bron' and 'The Killing.'","It's just great when my job makes me more curious.","I used to speak Algerian, but I'd lost nearly everything.","I think that's one of the biggest problems in the world - we don't look at one another; we don't listen to one another."],"Leila Janah":["My personal style comes from jugaad, a Hindi word meaning doing more with less.","Work is at the core of human dignity.","Most philanthropists want to be effective altruists. But the problem isn't intention: it's measurement. Unlike financial investing, which has reporting standards, audit processes, and educational requirements, social investing is notoriously tricky to evaluate.","So often, we leave the selfless side of ourselves for nights and weekends, for our charity work. It is our duty to inject that into our day-to-day business, into the work that we do, to improve corporations, to improve civil society, and to improve government.","True leadership isn't about having an idea. It's about having an idea and recruiting other people to execute on this vision.","The challenges that the homeless face aren't dissimilar to those in developing countries.","They say a picture is worth a thousand words. In the nonprofit world, the right picture is worth tens of thousands of dollars. I use PhotoPad to sync our Samasource Flickr account to my iPad and slip it out of my purse at cocktail parties to tell our story.","In order to thrive in the 21st century, you have to be a savvy citizen of the digital economy or risk being left behind.","The best way to make employees happy is to set realistic goals and achieve them. The big job is to make sure those small steps are pointing us in the right direction and demonstrate at the end of the year that they all add up to something pretty great.","Every woman that dies or loses her baby on a threadbare cot in the heart of Uganda, while her sisters on the other side of the world enjoy first-class care, is a threat to our collective humanity.","I founded Samasource because I was frustrated by traditional approaches to poverty alleviation. Even those approaches focused on jobs often equip poor people with skills for which there is little market demand.","I think part of the problem with charity is that it tends to make us view people as helpless victims. I think in the future, we'll look back on charity in the same way that we look back on colonialism today: as a very paternalistic system that doesn't fully recognise the full spectrum of humanity.","Handouts are not going to end global poverty, but work - real work - just might.","We think the way out of poverty is to view the poor as producers, and the Internet is probably the most efficient tool we have for tapping this capacity. Because you don't need roads. You don't need customs officials who are friendly. You don't need to manage shipping and delivery schedules. You don't have to worry about tariffs.","Like so many first generation children of Indian immigrants, I learned to believe in a dream that is as much American as it is universal: a dream of equal opportunity for all based on merit, of power concentrated not in the hands of a few at the top, but fanning across a large, educated, and civically engaged middle class.","I grew up believing in meritocracy and the American dream. My parents came here from India. They had no connections. My brother and I went to public schools, and both of us succeeded.","A lot of people are happy to give money to charities but are wary of giving through taxes because they feel it doesn't produce any value.","My mom was a big feminist, and when I was growing up, I wasn't allowed to have typical girl toys: she did not let me have dolls. Barbies were banned in our household. She read feminist books to me; my mom was a major feminist.","I'd worked at the World Bank briefly as an undergrad and studied poverty levels around the world - particularly those earning less than $1.25 a day.","Impact sourcing, a new initiative piloted by the Rockefeller Foundation and several key partners, including my company Samasource, promises to connect poor and marginalized people to digital jobs on a massive scale.","We know what happens when a woman earns money. She is far more likely than a man to spend her earnings on the health and education of her children and to invest in improving her family's standard of living.","I think the philosophy that you have to have if you travel frequently is, stuff is just stuff. Even if it has some sentimental or family connection, if you lose it in the world, it's still just a thing, and I think if you don't have that attitude, you will get incredibly stressed out and not enjoy your travels.","The amount of work that a for-profit has to do to get real money is minimal compared to the amount of work it takes a non-profit to get even a very small grant.","Using the Internet to secure employment is as vital to a construction worker as it is to a software engineer.","In terms of environmental impact, Samasource jobs are very green. Our product is human intelligence, and it's transported through the Internet rather than via carbon-intensive trucking, shipping, and warehousing.","Traditional charity is still fairly focused on how it makes donors feel as opposed to outcomes for people that need help.","Labor looks different in the 21st century. And so should our job training programs.","Samasource's largest clients are technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Getty Images, and TripAdvisor, which contract with my company rather than a traditional outsourcing company in order to participate in 'impact sourcing' - conscious efforts to reduce poverty by moving money into places that need it.","It's much easier for people to compare wages or identify bad employers or discuss bad labor practices in the Internet economy than it was in, say, a factory environment, where that stuff wasn't usually published or available.","I wish the city of San Francisco, bastion of liberalism, were more innovative when it comes to how to spread the wealth.","I always loved fashion and clothes. Not because I think that's a woman's place, but because I care about aesthetics. I like art; I like going to art museums, and to me, these things are just manifestations of one's aesthetic sense.","I think people are hungry for new ideas and leadership in the world of poverty alleviation. Most development programs are started and led by people with Ph.Ds in economics or policy. Samasource is part of a cadre of younger organizations headed by entrepreneurs from non-traditional backgrounds.","At Samasource, a company I founded in 2008, we train people living in poverty from Kenya to California to develop and market 21st century digital skills to adapt to new economic realities.","Barbies were banned at our house, along with television other than PBS. As a kid, I found this horribly embarrassing.","I believe there is no other way to create decent livelihoods for the world's poorest people than to connect them to global markets as producers, and on fair terms.","Much like the opportunities that factory work provided for working-class Americans in the last century, microwork will provide opportunities for marginalized people in this one. All they really need is basic literacy, a cheap computer, and an internet hookup.","Migration is the story of my life: my parents and grandparents journeyed across four continents to flee war and find jobs, eventually finding their way to the U.S.","Often, we think that things are the way they are because of intelligent design - because somebody super-smart, or some group of academics, came up with the best system ever to do XYZ. Actually, things are often the way they are because of an accident of history.","Most of us working on poverty alleviation simply want to know, 'How much poverty can I reduce for every dollar I donate?'","Social business lies in the spectrum of possibility between the traditional, profit-maximizing business, which directs little to no profit to doing good, and the traditional charity, which relies mostly on donations to sustain itself.","Bling is passe, and I like my style to reflect just that. Ruthless editing defines true style perfectly.","I own a shameless number of ethnic necklaces acquired at local markets in developing countries or inherited from my grandmother. These have seen me through meetings in Davos and visits to refugee camps.","The core concept of Samasource is essentially that technology helps us unlock human talent wherever it may happen to reside. That we should no longer be victims of the birth lottery. That no one should be stuck in a poor place where they don't have a job simply because of an accident of birth.","The best way to end poverty is to simply give people work, which isn't considered 'sexy' among donors who want to fund a preschool or cure a disease.","Technology is a tough realm to navigate as a younger woman who is not married. It can be hard to cultivate professional relationships because you have to be conscious of how to engage potential investors.","We have people from places like Oracle, Microsoft, Intuit. Sama plays a huge role in why people leave lucrative careers to join a social enterprise.","It's really helpful to be physically engaged in something that's completely different from my day-to-day work.","I used to think that the worst form of discrimination for women was being hit on or hearing something disparaging. What's even more challenging for young women is a very senior male who will take an interest in you, who see themselves as father figures or mentors.","I used to think my job as a CEO meant managing metrics and meeting goals, but I've realised now that's it's about managing my board and employees.","I really love travelling to places where I get to learn something new about a new group of people or a new place. Learn some history, contemplate some business ideas, and sort of get off the beaten track a little bit.","I think what travelling has done for me and for many generations of my family - my grandmother was a great example - it's really highlighted for me how similar we all are and how many values we all share as people on this planet.","Sama means 'equal' in Sanskrit; I chose 'Samasource' because I thought it really reflected a value that I had and that I wanted the company to have, which is that everyone has equal capabilities and deserves an equal chance.","I'm the founder and CEO of Sama Group, a family of social enterprises - Samasource, Samahope and SamaUSA - that are working to alleviate poverty by connecting the global community to opportunity in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, the Caribbean and here in the U.S.","I love adventure. When I'm not working or on the road, you can find me in my favorite spots around the Mission neighborhood of S.F., kitesurfing in the Bay or dancing.","I love dancing and practiced ballet for ten years until I realized I wouldn't make it professionally - then I started taking salsa classes. I learned to dance samba in Rio and Salvador when I lived in Brazil.","Dancing is my therapy. I also try to meditate every morning and take several two-hour yoga classes a week at my favorite yoga studio, Urban Flow.","The more time I spent in developing countries, and the more time I spent talking to poor people, I realized what they want more than anything is a good job.","We spend billions on international aid annually, but we don't find ways to connect people to dignified work. I realized that if we don't think about ways to harness private capital to solve problems, we're leaving large amounts of money on the table and doing ourselves a disservice.","I think the way you build a company for the future has to include social impact; it has to be part of the fabric of your company. I think when you do that, you invariably end up with much better outcomes, even in the short-term.","The problem in a lot of low-income countries is that people take out loans to go and get degrees, which are then irrelevant in the job market.","The thing that the Internet does is it allows labor to move freely across borders in the way that capital does but, traditionally, labor cannot. So the Internet frees workers to be based anywhere and work for employers anywhere.","I think in general, people who aren't themselves entrepreneurs are often more risk averse. And I think you see this dynamic a lot with entrepreneurial people who lead a company, which is that they hire people who complement them.","I grew up in Los Angeles, where long drives on packed freeways make everyone a fan of radio and, particularly, of America's national treasure, National Public Radio.","FlipBoard is the 'W Magazine' of the iPad-app world. The sleek interface makes content from your friends' Facebook and Twitter feeds much easier on the eyes by displaying them in a magazine format.","Through my studies, I became increasingly disillusioned with the international aid system. I think we systematically deny poor people the chance to engage as equals in the global economic order. At best, we give them handouts or tiny loans and hope they will suffer a bit less from extreme poverty. We don't view them as equals.","Microwork gives marginalized people a chance to earn a living by playing a vital role in the business processes of big companies. In parallel, the organization assists local entrepreneurs in running microwork centers, helping to grow a new pool of business talent across the developing world.","Samasource creates jobs in regions where more traditional forms of employment in low-income economies, such as manufacturing, are difficult to scale because of poor infrastructure. In a village in Rukka, India, for example, our small data entry partner employs over 60 people doing various types of Internet research for Samasource.","The perception in Silicon Valley is that if you dress well, you couldn't possibly be smart, or you're in P.R. but couldn't possibly run a company. I remember briefly attempting the Adidas and jeans and sweatshirt over T-shirt look, but I realized I was trying to dress like a young tech geek, and that just wasn't me.","Many people don't think that the poor in the developing world can do work on a computer. They won't say it explicitly. But they think it's too sophisticated."],"Leila Josefowicz":["You're playing serious music, and you want to be taken seriously. When they get my age wrong on the program, I wish they'd make me older.","Classical music has been based on works people love and come back to for aural comfort.","I think humor is important for all of us, and a great comedian is a great treasure.","It's nice not to have the majority of the attention on me like there is when playing a concerto with an orchestra.","I suppose that's why new music and I go well together, because new music often requires maintaining great rhythm.","My goal would be trying to bring some light to the world, which is often a dark and violent place.","People, of all ages, are far more open than you might think to being moved in new ways.","I guess really what my goal is is just to enlarge the violin repertoire.","If I can add, say, 10 great new violin concertos to the repertoire before I'm done, that will be truly exciting.","When the music is physically demanding, I want to make sure that the effort involved is put across to the audience through physical gesture."],"Leila Slimani":["Let's stop hiding behind a pseudo-respect of cultures, in a sickening relativism that's only a mask for our cowardice, our cynicism, and our powerlessness. I, born Muslim, Moroccan, and French, I will say it to you: Sharia makes me vomit.","'Lullaby' is about boundaries.","People are not born evil, although we all have evil within us.","For me, it is freedom, freedom from everything: when I write, I'm not a woman. I'm not a Muslim. I'm not a Moroccan. I can reinvent myself, and I can reinvent the world.","My parents were lovers of books, and they raised us in a manner that viewed freedom and subversion as indispensable.","I remember, when I was a teenager, people telling me, 'You know, when you are a mother, you will never feel lonely. You will feel so much love, and you will be fulfilled by this love.' Then I became a mother. And I learnt that is absolutely wrong: you can feel very lonely with your children, even if you love them.","I love looking at pieces of art through the eyes of a child.","When I was a little girl and people would ask me what I wanted to be when I got older, I always used to say I want to be paid to think. So for me, to dream, to think, to write - it is wonderful.","One of the big mistakes of the Moroccan elite and the elite in the Muslim world was to be afraid of the conservatives. They are fighting for their ideas. Why shouldn't we fight for our ideas?","I am not afraid of being a pariah.","I remember that the first time I looked at my son, of course I felt love. But I think the first feeling was not love: it was fear. Someone is needing me. If something happens to him, what am I going to do? Maybe I won't survive if something happens to him? The fear was as big as the love.","I knew I wanted to write about a nanny, but it was difficult for me to find a narrative rhythm.","When you live closely with people, you don't see who they really are. In particular, with nannies, they only exist in your home, and when they leave, they don't really exist anymore for you.","I like to describe my characters as though they were all trapped in a glass box.","The only way you can know someone is through their actions - you can never know what's going on inside them.","I had a nanny growing up in Morocco, and my parents encouraged me to put myself in her shoes sometimes.","I am not patriotic or nationalistic, but the French language is like a country where I take refuge when I have nowhere else to go. It consoles me for everything. For me, the language no longer belongs to the colonialists.","Authors have a nationality; books do not.","I, too, am interested in identity and Islam, which is what people expect of us. But one must not write what is expected. It's important for North African writers to show they have other things to say.","A nanny is a woman who lives in an apartment, but the apartment is not her own. She raises children, teaches them how to walk, how to speak; she gives them food - but these children are not her children. So she is in a very ambiguous place.","Motherhood is not only something very pure and very full of love, it can be full of dark things, too.","I think maternal instinct is a male construct that has been used for centuries to keep women in their place, at home.","I like anti-hero women. Negative female characters interest me.","Human darkness fascinates me; I find it intriguing. And there are few female characters who are explored in this light.","Authorities in Rabat believe that if we create a Moroccan character, even in a work of fiction, we are responsible for the image of Moroccan women.","You have to fight against all the things that will keep you out of writing, because life doesn't go with writing. You will always have something more important to do: you will have to take your children to school, you will have to cook something, you have to meet friends. But you have to fight if you want to write.","I don't really consider myself an immigrant, because I was born French; I have always spoken the language. I never had the feeling of being a foreigner. I was very lucky: I came to France, and I had enough money to study and to rent a studio. So, for me, it was not difficult.","When I was a little girl, my first link to the world was as a reader. Sometimes, I feel a nostalgia for those times, for all the emotions I felt as a child - discovering novels, discovering Dickens, Balzac, or Dostoevsky.

I was the kind of girl who could tell her father, 'No, what you are saying is totally untrue, and I don't agree with you.'","That animal part of us, it's the most interesting part. It's everything that has to do with drives, with things we can't stop ourselves from doing, with all the spaces where we're unable to reason with ourselves. It has its dark side, but there's a luminous side, too, which is the fact that we're just another species of animal.","I grew up in Morocco. I was born a Muslim, and, every year, I celebrated Christmas in a big white house in the country, halfway between Meknes and Fez.","Everyone asks me, 'Why do you choose such subversive or shocking themes?' but when I'm alone in my office, I'm not like, 'OK I'm going to shock.' I want to write about a character who fascinates me, someone who I don't understand.","I want to say that I can be Moroccan and speak about someone without speaking about his nationality. Because, you know, I have the feeling that when you come from Morocco, when you come from Afghanistan, when you come from Africa, Occidental people always wait for you to write a novel about identity.","It's very important to say that French doesn't belong to France and to French people. Now you have very wonderful poets and writers in French who are not French or Algerian - who are from Senegal, from Haiti, from Canada, a lot of parts of the world.","I love cooking shows! I'm not a bad cook myself, but I must say that I admire the creativity of those young chefs. It makes me jealous... and hungry.","I don't listen to music. I know it's weird, and I have no explanation for that. But I never do.","When you become a 'public person,' I find it very difficult to keep following social media. It is too harsh, too violent. I only read newspapers online.","You want your children to love the nanny, but at the same time, you want to stay the mother, and you want to be the most-loved. So there is a sort of jealousy between the mother and the nanny.","All fiction is based on truth - 'Madame Bovary' is based on a true story!","My two sisters and I had a very nice nanny at home in Morocco until I was 13. I remember my parents saying how she had insinuated herself into our family. They knew she would suffer when we broke away from her.","A mother should never be blamed for working.","As a mother, you're only allowed to talk about the 'good' moments - not the ones when you've had enough and want to be on your own. Or just want to be a woman, not a mother.","I just don't believe that a woman is naturally closer to her child than a man. Not at all.","People don't want to treat their nannies subserviently. They don't want to act like bosses. And so nobody quite knows how to behave, and everyone is slightly pretending that the mother and nanny are 'equal' - when that's not the case.

With garlic, it's personal; I have never been that big of a fan of its flavor. As for extra-virgin olive oil, I do use it quite often but its ubiquity serves to overshadow many wonderful oils like pistachio, walnut, argan and even grapeseed.","My culinary wardrobe is the same as my biking wardrobe, just no shoes.","I'm a good skin, natural makeup kind of gal.","Designing bridal is perfect for me, because black is my least favorite color, if you could call it a color.","I love to cook and entertain.","The hands really show signs of age.","For my kids, I cook everything.

They did so, not because they were opposed to fun, but because they judged these activities to be inherently harmful or immoral.","When you think about Puritanism, you must begin by getting rid of the slang term 'Puritanism' as applied to Victorian religious hypocrisy. This does not apply to seventeenth-century Puritanism.","The Puritans' sense of priorities in life was one of their greatest strengths. Putting God first and valuing everything else in relation to God was a recurrent Puritan theme.","The oldest theory of art belongs to the Greeks, who regarded art as an imitation (mimesis) of reality. The strength of that theory is that it explains the way in which art takes its materials from real life.","In Puritan thinking, the Christian life was a heroic venture, requiring a full quota of energy.","Puritanism was a youthful, vigorous movement.","Since God is the one who calls people to their work, the worker becomes a steward who serves God.","Literature incarnates its meanings as concretely as possible. The knowledge that literature gives of a subject is the kind of knowledge that is obtained by (vicariously) living through an experience.","The goal of Bible translation is be transparent to the original text - to see as clearly as possible what the biblical authors actually wrote.","A Christian philosophy of literature begins with the same agenda of issues that any philosophy of literature addresses. Its distinctive feature is that it relates these issues to the Christian faith.","Writers themselves benefit from all helpful information about their task and methods. Readers, in turn, can have both their understanding and appreciation of literature enhanced by information about the writer's work.","Readers should aspire to what is excellent. They should refuse to read a substitute Bible. They should want a Bible that calls them to their higher selves - or to something higher than their current level of attainment.","With so many contradictory renditions of the biblical text, the public has lost confidence that we can actually know what the Bible says. It is an easy step from this skepticism to an indifference about what the Bible says.","No group of people has been more unjustly maligned in the twentieth century than the Puritans. As a result, we approach the Puritans with an enormous baggage of culturally ingrained prejudice.","The Puritans were obsessed with the dangers of wealth.","The Puritans removed organs and paintings from churches, but bought them for private use in their homes.","There is a quiet revolution going on in the study of the Bible. At its center is a growing awareness that the Bible is a work of literature and that the methods of literary scholarship are a necessary part of any complete study of the Bible.","The Bible is obviously a mixed book. Literary and nonliterary (expository, explanatory) writing exist side by side within the covers of this unique book.","My claim is simply that the literary approach is one necessary way to read and interpret the Bible, an approach that has been unjustifiably neglected. Despite that neglect, the literary approach builds at every turn on what biblical scholars have done to recover the original, intended meaning of the biblical text.","For the Puritans, the God-centered life meant making the quest for spiritual and moral holiness the great business of life.","Stressing the God-centered life can lead to an otherworldly withdrawal from everyday earthly life."],"Leland Stanford":["Each co-operative institution will become a school of business in which each member will acquire a knowledge of the laws of trade and commerce.","Labor can and will become its own employer through co-operative association.","I have always been fully persuaded that, through co-operation, labor could become its own employer.","Many writers upon the science of political economy have declared that it is the duty of a nation first to encourage the creation of wealth; and second, to direct and control its distribution. All such theories are delusive.","I am in favor of carrying out the Declaration of Independence to women as well as men. Women having to suffer the burdens of society and government should have their equal rights in it. They do not receive their rights in full proportion.","The production of wealth is the result of agreement between labor and capital, between employer and employed. Its distribution, therefore, will follow the law of its creation, or great injustice will be done.","Every thoughtful and kind-hearted person must regard with interest any device or plan which promises to enable at least the more intelligent, enterprising, and determined part of those who are not capitalists to cease to labor for hire.","The right of each individual in any relation to secure to himself the full benefits of his intelligence, his capacity, his industry and skill are among the inalienable inheritances of humanity.","Money is the great tool through whose means labor and skill become universally co-operative.","The employer class is less indispensable in the modern organization of industries because the laboring men themselves possess sufficient intelligence to organize into co-operative relation and enjoy the entire benefits of their own labor.","A man's sentiments are generally just and right, while it is second selfish thought which makes him trim and adopt some other view. The best reforms are worked out when sentiment operates, as it does in women, with the indignation of righteousness.","All legislative experiments in the way of making forcible distribution of the wealth produced in any country have failed.","Each individual member of a co-operative society works with that interest which is inseparable from the new position he enjoys. Each has an interest in the other.","From my earliest acquaintance with the science of political economy, it has been evident to my mind that capital was the product of labor, and that therefore, in its best analysis there could be no natural conflict between capital and labor.","Government itself is founded upon the great doctrine of the consent of the governed, and has its cornerstone in the memorable principle that men are endowed with inalienable rights.","I want, in this school, that one sex shall have equal advantage with the other, and I want particularly that females shall have open to them every employment suitable to their sex.","In a condition of society and under an industrial organization which places labor completely at the mercy of capital, the accumulations of capital will necessarily be rapid, and an unequal distribution of wealth is at once to be observed.","In a very alert and bright state of society people learn co-operation by themselves, but in older and quieter conditions of laboring enterprise, such a bill as I propose will point out the way to mutual exertion.","In the unrest of the masses I augur great good. It is by their realizing that their condition of life is not what it ought to be that vast improvements may be accomplished.","It is probable that for a long time to come the mass of mankind in civilized countries will find it both necessary and advantageous to labor for wages, and to accept the condition of hired laborers.","Laboring men can perform for themselves the office of becoming their own employers.","Legislation has been and is still directed towards the protection of wealth, rather than towards the far more important interests of labor on which everything of value to mankind depends.","The country blacksmith who employs no journeyman is never conscious of any conflict between the capital invested in his anvil, hammer and bellows, and the labor he performs with them, because in fact, there is none.","The employee is regarded by the employer merely in the light of his value as an operative. His productive capacity alone is taken into account.","The great advantage to labor arising out of co-operative effort has been apparent to me for many years.","The only distribution of wealth which is the product of labor, which will be honest, will come through a more equal distribution of the productive capacity of men.","The real conflict, if any exists, is between two industrial systems.","The rights of one sex, political and otherwise, are the same as those of the other sex, and this equality of rights ought to be fully recognized.","The seeming antagonism between capital and labor is the result of deceptive appearance.","There is no reason why the women of the country should not greatly advance themselves.","There would be no idling in a co-operative workshop. Each workman, being an employer, has a spur to his own industry, and has a pecuniary reason for being watchful of the industry of his fellow workmen.","When money is controlled by a few it gives that few an undue power and control over labor and the resources of the country. Labor will have its best return when the laborer can control its disposal."],"Lele Pons":["The inspiration for my Vines comes from thinking about funny and relatable experiences from my daily life.","I am someone that is very hard to handle.

That's why a lot of people are intimidated.","I was always the last one on Facebook, Instagram - everything.","I went to high school, and I started getting bullied because I was very weird. I mean, freshman year I went to school in a pirate suit - I just didn't care. I'm not like the cool girls - I'm the other girl. The one that's basically a nerd, but proud of that.","Dedicate a lot of your time creating Vines and try to post daily.","People tell me all the time when they meet me, in comedy, they say 'You have that type like Sofia Vergara; you can be like her.' She's beautiful, but she can be ugly, too; she can make ugly faces. She doesn't care. She's very outgoing.","I always wanted to be a singer. I was going to finish school and go to Berkley, and then Vine came out, and I felt like I could finally show people my talent. I can even sing in the Vines. It's honestly changed my life. I don't know where I would be right now without it.","Ariana Grande was on a TV show, and then she started her career singing. If I'm offered a TV show, I'm going to pursue that and then see if I can push my singing. And then if I push my singing, awesome. My biggest goal, though? Be an actress in movies.

They told me that they had not decided to take me in, rather that it was God that had decided it for them.","My real mother is a survivor, very strong and respected by the people who know her, but our relationship is not easy - but then, it was never going to be.","To Western parents that want to adopt a child, I would say to people that money is not everything, wealth does not matter.","I have spent most of my adult life proving that I existed. A blog is an accessible way of doing this - there is a date and place in cyberspace that I existed a year ago, to the day, and the proof is still there.","I think we are in an age where cash pays for time and space.

'Cause work controls my life, writing controls my life, performing controls my life. So I don't listen to any music that's not an influence on what I'm working on that day.

We have other poets, and other writers, and other heroes, yet we do not afford them the veneration that we afford to Robert Burns.","Besides, I always thought that one of the great attractions of practising law was what I like to call the collegiality of the profession and I think that duty of collegiality applies even when we are retired.","For in the works of Robert Burns we see the whole cosmos of man's experience and emotion, from zenith to nadir, from birth until death.","Having said that, I enjoyed every minute of my time and I got a degree of job satisfaction which I am sure was far greater than the majority of my colleagues.","I think that practising the law, particularly litigation, and particularly in Glasgow, has always been difficult enough without adding to it by having problems with professional colleagues or former colleagues.","If anyone ever asked me what I had to complain about it would not have taken long to tell them. Maybe I was just easily pleased.","If I was starting off now, I would probably have taken one or two different turnings along the way.","The option of solicitor advocacy came on the scene a bit too late for me.","There are even more statues of Robert Burns than of any other figure in world literature. Indeed if we discount figures of religion, then only Christopher Columbus has more statues than he worldwide.","There does not seem to be that collegiality I referred to, there seems to be much more of a them versus us attitude, rather than we all have a role to play in this process so let's get on with it."],"Len Goodman":["I am a little bit of a softie, yes.

When I'm working for another editor, I'm obliged to follow their vision.","If a story isn't working, I'm simply unable to finish it. That's what usually tells me something is wrong.","People who were more concerned with themselves and looking good to their readers then they were with the characters sacrificed a series for the sake of a story.","I think there's something inherently dishonest in trying to go back and mess with the past.","I try to find what makes even the worst, most despicable character sympathetic at his or her core.","The bottom line always remains the same: What is the basic humanity of the character?

I don't believe any character believes their goals to be truly evil.","These days, it seems that if you're not already in place, you can't get there from here.","Unfortunately, there are writers whose only concern is how good they could make themselves look on a title.","Were there stories I wrote along the way that were terrible clinkers? God, yes. But they were all a product of their time, and I did the best I could.","What makes a story is how well it manages to connect with the reader, the visceral effect it has.","When I'm my own editor, there's very little difference between the first draft and the final. I write what feels right to begin with. I rarely make any major changes.","When someone writes to tell me something I've written made them laugh or cry, I've done my job and done it well.

So I have to write them.","My uncle's a lawyer and I remember going to see him in court and thinking, 'That's cool, too bad I could never be a lawyer.'","When I write I'm never really thinking about themes or the universal.","My weight fluctuates depending on my mood and my current devotion to my fitness routine.","I can play very annoying girl, very lost girl and then all the things in the spectrum between.","Positive, healthy, loving relationships in your twenties... I don't know if anyone would disagree with it: I think they're the exception, not the norm. People are either playing house really aggressively because they're scared of what an uncertain time it is, or they're avoiding commitment altogether.","I am anti-pants.","I'm ridiculous in my oversharing; my mom and sister are very open but a little more judicious than me... and my father is a decidedly private person.","It's very easy for me to say what success is. I think success is connecting with an audience who understands you and having a dialogue with them. I think success is continuing to push yourself forward creatively and not sort of becoming a caricature of yourself.","All my freakouts have been pretty private and directed at family pets and/or people I have been dating for too short a time to freak out at in that way.","I don't really read reviews... That's not where my attention goes.","My parents are artists; in their world, in the world of modern artists, you are supposed to just go into your studio and tune everything out, and your entire relationship with your work is supposed to be a super private one. That was the way to do it and you weren't deeply truly artistic if that wasn't the way you were engaging the press.","I love what I do, I love every minute of it.","I guess I think about doing stuff that nobody else has done.","I feel like you don't know if someone's equipped for a romantic relationship until they're out of their twenties.","It's really hard to grow with another person.","When I graduated college I had a series of just humiliating jobs that I couldn't believe I was at.","I seriously consider television to be the people's medium.","I'm always afraid that I'm being unprofessional, yet I continue to sign all my e-mails 'xoxo.'","I always thought the saddest feeling in life is when you're dancing in a really joyful way and then you hit your head on something.","I have to write people who feel honest but also push our cultural ball forward.","I always imagined that having a baby is something that I'm going to keep in a private place, but maybe my curse is that all I'm going to want to do is tell everybody about what my birth process was like and what my children's nightmares are.","Everyone needs something from me.","You know, I always think of myself as sort of ready for every criticism.","I mean, I - it's so funny, I am, you know, I am, you know, a working woman out in the world, but I still live with my parents half the time. I've been sort of taking this very long, stuttering period of moving out.","You know, bad poetry I wrote in high school can still be found on the Internet, and, you know, there's a Web log of our college newspaper. You know, there's so many different stages of my creative development are sort of on-record if somebody were to choose to look for them.","None of my actions have ever sort of been motored by the search for a husband or wondering if I was going to have a family someday or wanting to live in a really great house or thinking it would be really great to have a diamond.","I feel like a lot of the female relationships I see on TV or in movies are in some way free of the kind of jealousy and anxiety and posturing that has been such a huge part of my female friendships, which I hope lessens a little bit with age.","It's almost like when you're young, your friends take on the romance role, and then guys take on the role of your friends later.","I do think girls in their twenties accept certain kinds of lesser treatment than they would at other times in their lives.","I sort of tend to equate tattoos with prisoners, punks or people with a high level of self-confidence. I don't necessarily have a covered-in-tattoos personality.","I sometimes want to make a book of every tattoo I wanted to get before I actually got a tattoo, because there were so many awful ideas and concepts.","No one wants to see a tattoo on a stomach.","It's interesting to see how other people react to an oversharer.","I'm not great at dating, but I need to do it to relax.","I've only recently realized that I have a radically different relationship with my parents than a lot of people.","I thought I was really a radical, political person, which of course I am not.","There's people who don't want to see bodies like mine or bodies like their own bodies.","I had always written. I had written stories and poems. Then I started writing plays.","You know, when I first started making online videos, there were a lot of filmmakers I befriended who were doing it too.","I think that people in the phase between being someone's kid and being someone's parent have always been uniquely narcissistic, but that social media and Twitter and LiveJournal make it really easy to navel-gaze in a way that you've never been able to before.","I had no friends. I worried a lot.","My parents were very supportive when I was growing up and have been all the way through.","I would go to work from 9 to 6, go home, nap for two hours, then write from 8 to 2 a.m.","I didn't have to wait six years to get my show on the air, worry that someone else had a similar idea, or wait around for notes that took my voice out of the show.","At my age, no one is married, no one has kids, no one has a career.","I've always been someone who feels better, if I see what I'm going through in a movie.","I love flawed female characters, duking it out.","I quit acting when I was 11 because I was cast as a bouncing ball in 'Alice in Wonderland,' and I felt slighted and wounded.","I feel like I don't watch that many shows with death.","I love directing scenes that I'm not in because suddenly I really feel like a filmmaker which is a different thing.","I'd love to write something for a male protagonist. That's sort of the next frontier for me. I think it'd be really amazing to write the kind of parts that I love for women but for a guy.","My mom knows pretty well how I see her.","The joke I always make about myself is that I'm self-involved, but I'm not vain.","I'm always having to be told to brush my hair.","Every time I start feeling sexy I trip.","Let's call a spade a spade - a lot of times when you are a vegetarian it is a just not very effective eating disorder.","There's always an article coming out, saying, 'The new thing is funny women!'","I think romantic comedy, when done right, is my favorite genre. It's just a genre that's very human.","I just hope that I continue to keep a line between my private life and who I play, even if they are closely intertwined, and so I'm careful. I don't even know where my line is, but I know I have a line.","The work that's interesting to me in other people is really confessional.","I thought I wanted to be a journalist or a novelist.","You're raised to think being a mother is an inevitable step in your development but you start to ask yourself questions, because not every woman does want to have children.","There are so many reactions to art that make sense to me - but 'ick' means something.","I went to an amazing school in Brooklyn called St. Anne's that's a really kind of creative hot bed.","I'm half Jewish half WASP.","I think breakfast is the one meal when you don't have to eat animal, maybe.","I'm glad if my work can make a difference.","I kind of look like every other girl, walking around.","It's funny, I never considered that people are going to see me on the show and maybe stop me on the subway.","I think if you feel like you were born to write, then you probably were.","If you're writing, you're starting in private. It can really be this amazing, private, freeing experience. Forget that it's for other people - that comes in later.","I find it really awkward to do a scene where I'm supposed to seem like I'm in love."],"Lena Headey":["Having the tattoo itself is not really for the end result for me. I like having them done.","For me, horror movies are a real escape.","There is something in the act of having tattoos done that I love. It can be quite addictive. I've got a few on my back because my friend is an artist, and a few on my arms. Every time I pass a tattoo parlour, I think, 'Maybe just a tiny one.'","I'm a tomboy. I used to get into a lot of fights. Don't know why - self-expression, I guess.","I always have scarves handy; they're my indulgence. I buy them at an L.A. shop called Lost & Found. I'll spray one with loads of my Byredo Gypsy Water perfume, put it on and be like, 'Ah, this feels good.'","There's nothing more exciting for an actor than a chance to lose, to be someone who has lost - especially if it's someone who starts off with a veneer of control. To be broken is wonderful.","I was obsessed with vampires when I was 13 or 14.","Shooting guns is not something I would do in my spare time. I really don't understand why Americans can purchase guns so easily and why they use them for sporting purposes.","People who never get anxious always amaze me. The world could be breaking up, and they're saying, 'Everything's fine!'","Getting older and having kids, you learn how to become less serious about it all.","I hate being looked at. Can't stand it. I know, I know - I picked the wrong career. I should have been a doctor. If you play certain parts you have this nice face painted on you, and then you have feel as if you have a responsibility to this idea of being beautiful. I hate that about our business.","There's a perceived inverse relation between looks and talent. Look at Charlize Theron - she made herself ugly for 'Monster' and suddenly everyone said 'she's a genius.' It shouldn't be like that.","With fantasy and sci-fi, it's based in a real fandom. You're presenting to experts, and their source material is really important to them. They'll come up and ask: 'so when you turned your head slightly in that scene, what were you thinking?'","I'm 40 next year and I'm very well aware that where I am now, it becomes a bit of a wilderness for actresses.","'Lost Boys' is one of my all-time faves. I just thought it would be great to be a vampire. I remember this movie called 'Once Bitten,' which is about an '80s sort of power girl who became a vampire and was really, like, sexy. Hair like she was from 'Dallas,' shoulder pads, big earrings.","I've never directed before, so I need to make sure that people know that I can. The movie that I've written, 'The Sophisticates,' is a... small ensemble comedy and I hope it's charming and funny.","Since being quite young, I've had a very strong sense of independence and survival. As a child, I was on my own two feet emotionally.","I have an internal protectiveness where it's like, if it comes to just me, as frightened as I am of losing someone I love or things going sour or simply being alone, there is a dark place in my brain where I'm like, It could happen and I'm okay, I'm prepared.","Nothing I do is by design. It's always the result of a happy accident. I didn't have a career plan. It has just become the way it is. It's all good fun.","I love being physical, but I am extreme either way. I can be superfit. And then I can be really lazy and ignore everything.","I am very much a seat-of-the-pants actor. I will prepare when I have to. But I like being unprepared.","I'm sort of like a T. rex in the world of female actresses. Every time a job is finished, I look at my car and think, 'Could I live in it?'","Does our culture have a need for violence? I don't know. I guess it's a personal thing.","I think I cry when I'm angry. I let it go that way.","Sometimes it's a bizarre, fairly cold, and horrifying thing to be a parent.","I look at someone like Kathryn Bigelow, and I have so much admiration. She's playing in the boy's sandpit, and winning.","I've got quite a big gay following. I played a lesbian prostitute in the TV series 'Band Of Gold' but I think my following really grew when I played one in the film 'Imagine Me & You,' with Piper Perabo.","As a teenager I was clinically depressed. Although I had lots of friends, I found those years very difficult.","Getting the role in '300' saved me. I'd been out of work for 11 months after 'The Brothers Grimm.' Once the film came out and didn't do so well, the director Terry Gilliam blamed me for absolutely everything. It was pretty appalling, and I had started to wonder if I'd ever get another job again when I was asked to audition for '300.'","I don't think you should feel guilty about pleasure. Defeats the purpose.","I worked in Tesco's staff canteen because I fancied a boy on the tills. I served him his lunch in a hairnet and tan tights. Not just that, of course - I had a lovely white onesie.","It's amazing the things that you cry at. I cry when I smell my son's hair in the morning. We have a moment of peace and I'll be like, 'Ahhhh! How can you love this much?'","That scene in 'The Purge' where my kids, Mary's kids, are in danger was really crazy for me, because I suddenly... I have my methods as an actor, so I went to the place of 'If somebody came near my children, with bad intent?'","It's a feeling without a lid, of what you would do, physically, verbally, to protect the one thing that is your greatest love.","I've said from day one that I've got no problem with nudity. I've done it throughout my career.","I could quite happily run a florist or a bake shop.","Cersei in 'Game of Thrones' is quite solid and stiff.","There is always that thought that you might get stuck with a character. But there's always the notion that every character is always evolving.","I was never one of the cool kids who read '2000 AD.'","'Dredd' was a weird little out-of-the-blue thing for me.","Nothing's ever allowed to just be entertaining. We have to talk about it.","A lady of a certain age must keep her top on. That's what I feel.","I'm sad I'm not in 'The Purge 2.'","If I was into politics, I would be rich.","I do what I do; I can't control who thinks what.","I drink a lot of coffee.","I carry about eight lip balms: Burt's Bees, Rosebud Salve, Eos.","I usually bring along a bottle of kombucha, thinking, 'This will be really good for me.' But I never actually drink it. The fermented mushroom-y flavor is too intense for me.","I like to keep my personal life private.","I'd love to do a comedy. Umm, I don't know when that will happen - maybe when I'm, like, 80 or something. But yeah, I'd love to. I'm just waiting for the right person to see my hilarious nature and offer me a comedy.","I'd like to play Walter White, but I guess that's been done.","I'd love to have played Joan of Arc. That would have been amazing.","There seems to be great roles for women, and it's not necessarily - you don't have to be young women. Suddenly, we're realizing that, generally, women are interesting, and they can also be weird and crazy and mean.","I find 'Chainsaw' to be a very relaxing film.","I almost never get recognised in the street.","I don't want to be owned by anyone.","Really, I still just think of myself as a Northerner, ultimately. It's in my DNA. I'll always have those Northern qualities. We can be mischievous. We can be bold.","I urge everyone - men, boys, women and girls - to join me in standing up for girls' rights with Plan U.K.","I'm small but quite tough. When incensed, I can swing a punch.","I have a scary side of me.","There's no snobbery in me.","I think I look slightly like a horse. Hand on heart, I think I'm pretty average.","Maybe you just don't see your own beauty.","I miss that London thing of walking outside and bumping into mates and going, 'Do you want to get a pint?'","Some 'Terminator' fans are outraged that I'm playing Sarah Connor. They think I'm not muscly enough. To be honest, I'm a little tired of the comparisons to Linda Hamilton. I know she will always be the original Sarah Connor, but when people see what I bring to the role, they will look at her with new eyes.","One day I can be ecstatically up, and the next, I can feel this real blankness, a deadness almost, which is scary.","One day I was in school, and the next I was acting opposite Jeremy Irons. That's how quickly it happened. I was in class and then working with Sir Anthony Hopkins.","I'm dreadful at schmoozing at Hollywood parties.","I love the chance to train with someone like Mark Twight.","I don't take anything for granted.","I would love to work with Shane Meadows - great director.","I've been working a long time, and mostly European films.","You couldn't get less royal than me.","I took up boxing as a fitness thing. I got obsessed, and I would go every day when I wasn't working. It's just an insane sport when you get into it."],"Lena Horne":["It's so nice to get flowers while you can still smell the fragrance.","My identity is very clear to me now, I am a black woman.","I told them I belong to the same organizations and clubs Mrs. Roosevelt belongs to, but with a few brave exceptions, I was still unable to do films or television for the next seven years.","I was lucky, as many of my generation was, in having a man like Dr. King in our lives. He came at a time that we needed to take a long look at each other and see how similar we were.","Don't be afraid to feel as angry or as loving as you can, because when you feel nothing, it's just death.","Always be smarter than the people who hire you.","I don't have to be an imitation of a white woman that Hollywood sort of hoped I'd become. I'm me, and I'm like nobody else.","Every color I can think of and nationality, we were all touched by Dr. King because he made us like each other and respect each other.","You have to be taught to be second class; you're not born that way.","Malcolm X raised my consciousness about myself and my people and other people more than any person I know. I knew him before he became Malcolm X.","I want to sing like Aretha Franklin. Before her I wanted the technical ability of Ella Fitzgerald.","I made a promise to myself to be kinder to other people.","As much as I try, when I open my mouth, Lena comes out, And I get so mad.","I'm still learning, you know. At 80, I feel there is a lot I don't know.","I really do hate to sing.","Malcolm X made me very strong at a time I needed to understand what I was angry about. He had peace in his heart. He exerted a big influence on me.","I'm not alone, I'm free. I no longer have to be a credit, I don't have to be a symbol to anybody; I don't have to be a first to anybody.","I remember the day tDr. King died. I wasn't angry at the beginning. It was like something very personal in my life had been touched and finished.","After I got over the terrible pain of having something of mine taken from me, I began to think how bad everybody else must be feeling. It wasn't a nice time."],"Lena Olin":["It's important not to lay in a bubble bath drinking champagne. It's important to take part in what life's all about.","I love the camera; there's something very special and sensual about it, and I have a tendency to call it a he, like it was a man. But, unlike a man, a camera is accepting of everything I do.","My favorite thing to do is eat and eat well.","To be a good actor, you have to be very smart. But to be a great actor, you also have to have a streak of, 'I'm an idiot, a complete lunatic.'","It strikes me every time I do an interview that I don't really sit around thinking about my goals and my life and my career. I do what I love doing and I get a lot of feedback. I'm free as a bird, you know? If I do something good, it's, 'Wow, that was brilliant,' and if I do something bad, it just goes away.","Acting is a very strange job.","There are a lot of things to get seduced by in America.","By the time the discussion starts about a movie, it's like bringing up an old boyfriend. It's like, 'I don't even remember exactly what he was like, and now we have to talk about it?'","I use myself for each part. Naturally, it's my body, it's my soul, it's my feelings. That's the only way I know how to work. I couldn't pretend.","I always sort of create practical problems so that I don't have to see a film I've just done. I'm too vulnerable, too fragile. People see your work, and there's nothing you can do. You're completely exposed.","Choosing a role is very difficult. There's no way to have a strategy.","I was so full of joy, the happiest kid. Things changed. I don't want to talk about it. I needed attention. I was pathologically shy. I'd climb the highest tree or try to ski off the highest mountain. I'd get into fights. I wanted contact. I'd hit somebody, just for that.","In Sweden, stardom is looked upon as phony. You walk to the theater every day like everybody else.","I'm not regimented. I don't diet, and I exercise the way I want to.","I consume music the way other people consume movies.","Everyone is complicated one way or another. But it's interesting to dig into a complicated character, to try to find that within yourself."],"Lena Waithe":["The things that make us different, those are our superpowers.","I hope that people will say that 'she told the truth, she told her truth, she wasn't afraid to live her truth, and she wasn't afraid to live her truth out loud.' That's what I want my legacy to look like.","I'm proud to carry that torch and be like, 'I'm gay! I'm black! Hang your dreams on me. Hang your hopes on me. I'll carry them to the best of my ability.'","With 'The Chi,' it's me observing my own city and also pulling some things from themes I've dealt with in my life.","I am always searching for something different or something fresh, something hasn't been done. But the truth is, at the end of the day, we're all sort of retelling something. We're doing a version of something that's already been done.","The truth is, for me, when I was a young black girl who knew I was different, was watching TV, I would always be staring at the TV set looking for myself, and I didn't see me. And when you don't see yourself, you start to think that you don't matter, or you start to think that something is wrong with you.","The cool thing about dope black style becoming in style is that the industry has no choice but to try and reduplicate that.","My family still lives in Chicago: my mother, my sister, my nephew, my family is there. So even though I am not living there, I feel very close to it, and I visit very often.","If you think you aren't valid for whatever reason, let my existence and the way the world embraces my existence tell you that you are valid. You deserve to look, live, and walk through the world however you see fit. That's why I find it extremely important to be so out, so black, and so myself.","Always maintain your composure.","I'm a black woman, so I'm obviously not going to write something where women aren't at the forefront.","Even white people are tired of watching white people's shows.","People always go, 'Damn, how you got all this happening at once?' I tell them it's the Chicago in me.","I wrote 'Twenties' back in 2009. I always wanted to tell a story where a queer black woman was the protagonist, and I'm so grateful to TBS for giving me a platform to tell this story.","Queer black characters have been the sidekick for long enough. It's time for us to finally take the lead.","I'm writing my story so that others might see fragments of themselves.","I never had everything I wanted, but I never wanted for anything.","I love a web series. But to me, it does the girl in Detroit a disservice who just watches television. It does a disservice to the girl on the south side of Chicago who doesn't go online.","I think once 'Empire' hit, there was a lot of bad black TV that followed, because we work in the business of hit-seekers and copycats, so they're like, 'Oh this is a show about black people; this is about music, OK let's do a version of that.' And, of course, it doesn't work because it's not organic.","Being on Netflix lets us be experimental. We can do crazy things.","Things meant to appeal to the masses usually end up appealing to no one.","For me, it's about making art that's not good but phenomenal. James Baldwin didn't want to just stay above the fray. Prince didn't think, 'I wonder what the industry is gonna think about 'Purple Rain.'' It's just, is this honest? Is this real? Does this move me? The rest is icing.","My mother was born into a segregated America. How crazy is that?","I had a lot of great bosses - I worked for Gina Prince-Bythewood for two years, I worked for Ava Duvernay as a PA on her first narrative film, and I worked with Mara Brock Akil, so a lot of wonderful role models.","As a black woman in the industry, you really do have to hold your head higher, stick your chest out, be kind and polite and generous even when you don't want to be sometimes. I learned that and, also, just to never take no for an answer.","I'm a huge fan of television, and the reason I'm a part of the world is because I'm a fan of it.","I'm a big fan of Nora Ephron, who believed everything is copy, and I agree.","I never thought I would write about Chicago, and I definitely never thought I would write a drama.","Maybe some young girl seeing me on the Emmy stage may have meant something for them.","I think that for the most part, black people specifically have sort of been used as props in TV shows as a way to move story along or as a way to make things more entertaining.","I think, to me, I always want to tell the truth. I never want to sugarcoat things. I've never been accused of pulling punches.","I've known I was gay since I was young, I think. And I mean young - like, young - like 5 or 6. I think most gay people or queer people know there's something different about them very early, but I didn't know what to call it.","I loved 'The Wizard Of Oz.' It was, like, you know how some kids, they're crying, and they put on - people put on 'Frozen' to get them to chill and just be quiet? For my family, it was 'The Wizard Of Oz.' They would literally tell babysitters, if she gets - like, if she starts misbehaving or she starts acting crazy, just put 'The Wizard Of Oz' on.","I was such a fan of Aziz. I watched 'Parks and Rec' like every other self-respecting hipster and loved his character so much and just thought he was so interesting.","I've never been a person that has had fear of, like, 'Oh, I don't want to be the poster child for all black lesbian women.' I don't know. I want to be someone in the public eye that they can be proud of.","I just really want be proud of the work I'm doing, whether it's something I've written, produced, or am starring in. I just want to be proud of it.","I love Sarah Jessica Parker. What's not to like?","It took me forever to leave Chicago. I went to Columbia College because I wasn't ready to leave! My professors had to kick me in the pants to move to Los Angeles.","Like 'Sex and the City' - if you're a New Yorker, you knew half the places they were going to. I want 'The Chi' to feel that way as well.","Every black man in Chicago walks through the world differently, and I think what young black boys do is observe, and that's what gives them their road map.","I actually don't like saying 'lead character,' which is an interesting thing. If you say there's a lead, then there has to be someone to follow.","I think it's so trite to say you have lead characters. It's like someone saying I'm the lead in my life.","I got into the business because I love writing. When it came down to finding my voice, which every writer has to take time to do, I think I realized I write black people very well. I write us in a very honest way, and I want to hear the way we really talk.","I feel like I wanna have a series of moments. It's scary when they say you're having a moment, because moments are momentary.","I'm very grateful that I'm the kind of actor where I'm not some character actor. I can't disappear into a world.","To be yourself is truly a revolutionary act, and I think more and more people should try it, because it's gotten me a pretty cool life.","The thing for me is to always tell the truth. Not to preach, but to tell the truth.","I don't need an Emmy to tell me to go to work. I've been working.","It was a symbolic moment when 'Moonlight' literally took the Oscar out of 'La La Land's' hand.","You have to write and develop and wait for the world to catch up to your art.","I don't want to be white. I don't want to be straight. I don't want to blend in.","When you're not as accessible, you get in a tent and get in your own head, and you start doing things that are a little out of touch. I think we've seen it happen with certain artists... people can't touch them; they're not touching people. They're only touching people in their circle.","I never want to feel too far away from people. I think that's when you get in trouble.","There's so many other talented women of color who write funny things every day, and I want them to be recognized, I want them to have a seat at the table because we're out here.","All the writers for 'The Chi,' they're all phenomenal, so I'm just working on projects with them. They have great scripts.","I'm queen of mentorship.","I feel like I've accomplished a lot, but for me, it's about pushing to the point where I can be Mark Walhberg, Ryan Murphy, or Shonda Rhimes. I want to be at that table in terms of bringing new voices in.","There's a lot of Donald Glovers, Jordan Peeles, Justin Simiens. And there's a lot of me's, too.","Wearing one hoop earring and playing with the androgyny - that's who I am. That's what I like to do. And I feel the world should see that. I'm not going to put a shield up or be more feminine to make people feel comfortable.","When people think of the South Side of Chicago, they don't think about where I'm from. It was sort of a pocket: this idyllic community of black people who took care of each other, knew each other, spent time with each other.","I was running around all the time, talking out of turn, a lot of energy, and obsessed with movies. There's nothing I loved more than going to the movies.","I remember going to 'The Wood' and leaving my friend and my mom, who I came with, to go sit in the front row because I was so excited.","I knew very early on I wanted to be a television writer. My teachers told me I was a strong writer and had a voice. I really leaned in to that.","I've been obsessed with television since I was 7 years old, and I've always been writing on some level.","People can say what they want about a person, but if you're successful and you make them money, then people don't care.","To be a black person is to come from a long bloodline of survivors and storytellers, with a resilience that people can't even comprehend.","I definitely have been very mindful of what kind of leader and creator I want to be. A lot of that has to with looking at the writers that you work with. They're all like your children. They all need love, but different versions of it.","The '80s really were - talk about no rules. People just did whatever they wanted; they could look however they wanted. There was just a lot of bigness and brightness.","I'm a big sneaker head.","'The Breakfast Club' was one of my favorites.","Being a black person in America is exhausting.","There's something specific about Chicagoans, and I just felt like I'd love to tell their story in a creative way. Not in a way to go, 'Oh, Chicago's perfect.' I don't believe that. I don't think that. I know we have our issues.","What's 'Atlanta' about? Technically, it's about a couple guys who are friends, but to me, 'Atlanta' is about black lives. I'm getting a real look at what black life means in Atlanta.","I think the stakes are always high when you're an artist of color - to get things right, to get things perfect and make everybody happy.","I watched a ton of TV because I was raised by a single mom and spent a lot of time with my grandmother. Like most grandparents do, she would spend hours and hours in front of the TV box.","The reason I get so excited about 'Master of None' is because it's showing people of color as regular people.","Being a black lesbian myself, I roll my eyes a little bit when I see black lesbian characters on shows where it's purely there for decoration. You can just hear it in the writers room... 'What if we make her a lesbian?'","It's weird because I see black gay characters on television all the time, but do I relate to them? Not always, because they're set pieces."],"Lene Hau":["Physics is about questioning, studying, probing nature. You probe, and, if you're lucky, you get strange clues.","There's a tremendous amount of work building the apparatus, getting the experiment to work. But sitting there late at night in the lab, and knowing light is going at bicycle speed, and that nobody in the history of mankind has ever been here before - that is mind-boggling. It's worth everything.","To get high data transfer rates in communicating information, you would love to use optical fibers. The problem is that light is extremely hard to manipulate. So we make a perfect copy of the information carried by the light. We transfer it to matter - the condensate.","Incidentally, think about the ramifications of storing data on light waves that can be stopped and started at the speed of light.","To me, what makes physics physics is that experiment is intimately connected to theory. It's one whole.","Why is it that I notice so many brilliant scientists using Macs for their personal computers; why does the Lawrence Livermore & Berkeley Labs buy millions of dollars worth of Macs?","Of course, in all magic tricks there's a secret."],"Leni Riefenstahl":["Through my optimism I naturally prefer and capture the beauty in life.","I am fascinated by what is beautiful, strong, healthy, what is living. I seek harmony.","I feel as though I have lived many lives, experienced the heights and depths of each and like the waves of the ocean, never known rest. Throughout the years, I have looked always for the unusual, for the wonderful, for the mysteries at the heart of life.","I set about seeking a thread, a theme, a style, in the realm of legend. Something that might allow me to give free rein to my juvenile sense of romanticism and the beautiful image.","Reality doesn't interest me.","I want to see, that's all. This is my life. I want to see.","The applause was so loud and insistent that I had to respond with several encores. I was numb with happiness, when it was over, I knew that this alone must be my life and my world."],"Lennart Meri":["If geography is prose, maps are iconography.","Security is like virginity: you're either a virgin or you're not. You either have security or you don't.","I am not always happy with the compliments Estonia has received.","Looking in the mirror to check if my tie is straight is a waste of my time. I only look in the mirror once a day, and that's in the morning when I shave.","History is more interesting than politics.","I was too busy looking into Yeltsin's eyes to notice what was under the table.","I've never met a general yet who could milk a cow.","In the past, when I shot films about fishermen and hunters, I always had to admire their ability to perceive time in its entirety. The present was always temporary.","Our civilisation has lost this bond between times, and tends to measure time with a yardstick, bit by bit, from one point to another.","Science will liberate us from the chains of big cities and lead us back to nature.","That radio was very important for me. It meant I always knew what was going on in the world.","Throughout Soviet times, I understood what was really happening in the world around me.","Traveling is the only passion that doesn't need to feel shy in front of intellect.","With that radio I was always swimming with the current political streams in the West. I was never stranded."],"Lennart Nilsson":["You know, of course, the specimens are not alive. We have to fix them in a fixing liquid formaldehyde and then we have to do a rinsing and then we have to coat them in a thin layer of gold.","We sometimes freeze the specimen with liquid nitrogen, which is extremely cold, you know. This is another technique we use now - but the specimens are not alive.","The chemistry of love is something which is extremely extremely unbelievable. This is something we have planned for more than two years, so I hope that we are going to start in the beginning of next year.","And I remember that the editors wanted to have a witness to say that this was really the case, because it was a very sharp picture of the just the face, the head of the fetus inside the womb.","There is a new way with very very tiny fiber optics, which give an enormous high resolution. There are many many thousand fibers, very very close together with a very small diameter.","For the animals, they came from the University in Uppsala and all different kinds of clinics here.","And my real enemy is not to hold the specimen sterile, but it's the lighting. The light is our real enemy. So we have to work with very very poor lighting. But we can increase the light with computers.","That's the new way - with computers, computers, computers. That's the way we can have the cell survive and get some new information in high resolution. We started about five years ago and, today, I think we have reached the target.","I have many times thought I did the wrong thing, but the reason was not to be a medical doctor - it was just to have the information. But then, maybe I was wrong, I don't know.","Of course, today at the Karolinska Institute, I am working with some top experts - even some Nobel prize winners. They have the latest news and I have the technique.","It's to surprise people about something that is extremely well known. I mean human reproduction, the human body, nature and so on. To surprise them with a new technique.","I have some friends, colleagues here at the Karolinska Institute and even in the United States and many other countries too, because we are working together as scientists.","I have the instruments, ideas, technology, computer techniques. We try to create or see something, which has not been known before - just to discover something together. This is always my dream."],"Lennie James":["If you look in real life, it is very hard to describe people as good people, bad people, heroes or villains. People aren't bad people. They all have their justifications.","I don't usually like talking about acting or what my process is, and all those kinds of things, because I don't necessarily think it's helpful to talk about how I do my job.","One of the things I liked about playing Tony Gates in 'Line of Duty' was that I don't think he gave much thought to justifying his actions until he was under investigation.","I owe 'Jericho' my whole time in America, really. It was a fantastic group of people to work with.","I'm not a broad comic, but I think I can be funny and I think I make people laugh.","I was dreading all of the ghost stories of working on American television, not in the least, the length. In Britain, a series is six episodes of an hour drama, maybe sometimes eight, but never twenty-two, so I was petrified of that.","I'm not setting 'Jericho' up to be anything other than what it is, which is, you know, a piece of good, well thought-out, well put-together TV and entertainment.","My thing is, I like playing guys who have a really interesting internal monologue.","I've worked in the theater, television, and films. A five-hour TV series is certainly more time than a character I'd be playing in a film.","I will say that when I first came out to the States to work on 'Jericho,' that was the only time that I've ever been frightened about a job, because in America they tell stories over such a long time, and I was petrified that I'd get bored.","My favorite television show of all time is 'Hill Street Blues.' I think it's the show that is to television what Pele was to football or Muhammad Ali was to boxing.","I've written virtually as long as I've acted, it wasn't a sudden transition. I acted in my first play when I was 16 and I wrote my first play when I was 17.","I went to an all boys' school in South London and the only god was sport.","I'm part of that generation that grew up watching TV, and being an actor was all about being on TV or being in films.","One of the things I learnt over the years is that there is a craft to writing, like there is a craft to acting. I hadn't done my apprenticeship as a writer. I did try to be a writer for hire but I'm not any good at it.","When I was growing up and watching 'The Sweeney,' the notion of police officers being an inch away from the villains that they're chasing was commonplace."],"Lennon Parham":["The smell of shrimp is comforting.","My favorite dessert is banana pudding.","In the summer of 2012 - and we do as we do when we get together to brainstorm an idea - we were both probably eating grilled cheese and watching 'Oprah's Favorite Things,' so it will never end, and we both brought a few things to the table of what we wanted our next project to be. And Jessica said, 'What if we raised a baby together?'","Right after you have a baby, the focus is on the baby. You don't feel sexual; you don't feel attractive; and you have a bigger job.","My family is from a tiny town in Alabama. So all I wanted to do was get out of this town.","'Felicity' was my 'Gilmore Girls' because I grew up in a small town.","Nobody wants an apology letter 14 years later.","I can eat Chipotle all day long for years.","The thing is, if you follow whatever meal you have with Coke, it eats up the other things. It helps with the digestion of it.","I had a moment - and I don't know if it was funny, necessarily, but I realized the effect I could have on people - when I was doing a production of 'The Little Prince,' and I played the snake.","I was obsessed with Carol Burnett and then Tracey Ullman. Like, obsessed with their shows.","For me, I met my husband when I was going full steam ahead of what I wanted in my career. We sort of intersected and were like, 'Oh, hi, hello!' We were both on our way somewhere to speak and then just kept going together.","There's nowhere in New York to go and have your emotions to yourself. People just look the other way because every day people see someone crying on the subway!","Don't say yes to something just because it's an opportunity.","I would say to someone, 'Make your own stuff sooner.' Also, it's OK to say no to something if it doesn't feel right.","Forcing people together is an enjoyable conflict to watch, but I think it's even more enjoyable if they love each other.","From the Twitter responses we got with 'Best Friends Forever' and the small feedback we are getting as the show is meted out, I think people are seeing themselves in the show and enjoying seeing female friendship portrayed in the way it really is.","We always thought we wanted to do a show that you could both laugh and cry in thirty minutes, and I don't know that there are that many comedies that try for that.","When I began to study baby delivery, when I was about to have a baby, I became very into it and fascinated and what our body does and how a mother's body temperature will rise the minute that the baby touches her chest because she needs to get warmer.","A lot of television shows, when you see births, the baby is coming out, and the wife is freaking, 'You did this to me!' but she is still super beautiful. There's none of the realism that we just went through.","When we're on Twitter, we're not only live tweeting episodes and talking about behind-the-scenes stuff, we actively try to respond to everybody.","You learn what can become a good joke and can be repeatable. You have a shorthand about how to introduce a joke to someone.","When you get into a fight with your partner or a friend, you usually have some weird, specific thing that you hold on to that you fight about that has nothing to do with what's going on.","It's pretty simple to me: we come from a really grounded world where anything you say could be the thing that the scene becomes about. We're always treating it as if we would treat it in real life. It's all observation.","The interesting thing for 'Playing House' to me is we both are at crossroads in the pilot. We both have our lives kind of upside-down, and then because we're taking care of each other, we're able to move forward and live our best lives.","You grow and you change, or at least you think you do, but you're kind of the same.","We took 'BFF' around to try and take it somewhere else because we were really proud of it, and it had gotten all that critical acclaim, and Twitter fans were going crazy about it.","The USA marketing team are geniuses at what they do. They do the right kind of thing for every medium. They're very active on social media; they're releasing videos every day up to the premiere.","In ten episodes, we were able to do our writers' room first. We did that all summer and wrote for 15 weeks and got everything in really good shape.","So much of comedy happens between your chin and your shoulders. Nobody tells you when you get your own TV show that you're going to watch yourself in the edit room over and over and over again. It's a tough lesson.","You just go straight for the reality of the situation. So when I sit down to write, I find myself judging it as I'm doing it, as opposed to letting it free flow.","Just because we're on USA, we didn't necessarily have to be the USA brand.","Marissa is one of the fan favorites of 'Comedy Bang! Bang!' for everyone throughout the years.","This whole motherhood thing has really been, like, back to work from the get-go. It's sort of a balance.","Jeff Wachtel, who was the main reason our show came back, and also got picked up to begin with, is from the New York theater.","I did my one-woman show in order to show people what to do with me.","I've been trying to cram myself down the throats of America for a longer time than I care to remember.","'Anne of Green Gables'! I'd love to be the nosy neighbor that gives Anne a mouthful and then gets puts in her place.","Give me a user manual, and I'm happy for hours.","Go for broke with what you believe and what you think is funny and what you're good at.","'Playing House' works because we're being supremely honest to what we think is funny and not what we think other people think is funny.","I just waited tables three nights a week to cover the bases.","The ones that I love of 'I Love Lucy' are when one of them decides they need something, and the other one is along for the ride, sort of as the voice of reason, and is helping and making it worse.","I'm obsessed with that show 'Call The Midwife'. Although I had to take a break at a certain point in my pregnancy because every episode is about having babies.","Zach Woods loves to go jet-skiing. That's a real thing in his real life. He's obsessed with it.","When you have girlfriends, and you get into it, and you share your flaws, and you're like, 'Oh my God. I almost had my period all over that chair,' or whatever. That's how we connect, right?","I was obsessed with 'Kids in the Hall', 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?', 'SNL'... like, I was a Conehead for one Halloween and the Wild and Crazy Guys for another.","Generally speaking, cancer - not that funny of a thing. When you hear about it, you don't go, 'Oh, hilarious!'... But within that - comedy, tragedy, hand-in-hand.","I loved Mommy and Me. I would go every day of my life. I had fun. I thought it was the best thing ever.","If I'm a fan, I'm a fan for life.","I was watching a lot of 'Game of Thrones' while I was breastfeeding a newborn.","I know the words to, like, every song. Hoobastank, whatever."],"Lennox Lewis":["In boxing you create a strategy to beat each new opponent, it's just like chess.","I have been in there with all of them and there is nothing left for me to prove.","Now I am ready to set new goals and start a new career for myself outside of the ring.","The fight will last as long as I allow it to last, and then I will knock him out.","During the past 23 years, I have set a number of goals for myself and I'm proud to say that these goals have been achieved.","If the money's right, I'm happy to bust up the other side of his face... No problem.","It's not rage that drives me, it's competition.","People know I was the last true champion.","Whatever I do, I always want to get better.","My main goal was to win all the belts, and I have done that.","After you win all these belts, you cannot fight all these mandatory guys.","You can just fight one man at a time.","So, I gave my belts out to others to give them a chance.","When you go into the other guy's backyard you cannot hope to win on points.","If the media didn't know I played chess, there'd be no angle on me at all.","I just want to complete my legacy.","I wanted to prove I was the best fighter in the world.","The mission I set out on in the beginning - to become heavyweight champion of the world, undisputed, lineal champion - you could say that mission is complete.","I don't have anything else to prove.","I've worked hard and accomplished what I've accomplished in the heavyweight scene.","When you look back in history and see other fighters coming back, it's never really been good for them.","If I don't feel the same hunger as I once did then I definitely shouldn't box any more.","I always ask myself why old heavyweights come back, but I plan to stay out of the ring.","I've got a new life now, a new future, there's a lot more to Lennox Lewis than just being a boxer."],"Lenny Abrahamson":["That's the way life is: meaning is always there, but there is no clearly given way of decoding it. Conventional cinema obscures this with an easy reduction of meaning to plot and schematic characters.","It's very important to have a good relationship with the crew and cast because you want to get the best out of them. They'll work really hard for you if they like you.","As with any actor and any collaborator, it's about forming a trusting relationship. And that's not that you have to get him to trust you so you can get him to do what you want. Especially with a little kid, it's about making them feel really safe, and getting to know and not treating them as a puppet to be moved around.","A big part of filmmaking is gathering a group of people you can work with.","I can just remember being broke, wondering if I had any talent - really wondering whether this was all a fantasy - but I had to get out there and keep trying.","For me, I always think of the image of sweeping out my footprints as I walk through a scene.","I think that I must be the only person who left California and headed to Dublin in pursuit of a career in film. The arrow is pointing in the other direction in most people's minds.","When I'm shooting, it averages out at a 16-hour day. You have two deadlines everyday - lunch and wrap.","Frank's really different from everything I've done. Maybe the one thing that's the same, and the thing that I tend to do, is that I think I can create an intimacy with the characters, like a sense of presence with the people in the film, and that's what I tried to do in 'Room' as well.","There are more ways to make 'Room' badly than well.","I don't think of myself as doing good works. It's not, 'Oh, I must give these poor people a voice.'","I've been in rooms where people are discussing films that have yet to come out and saying delightedly, 'Oh, I've heard it's a disaster!' The jealousy is unseemly.","I remember as a kid being asked if I was Jewish or Irish. I said, like the glib little 15-year-old I was, 'You can be both.' Feeling very pleased with myself. Before they smacked me.","The most conventional romantic trope of all is that you put lovers under extreme pressure, where they have to make decisions that illuminate aspects of that bond.","It's something I've noticed with my two children - children frequently know and don't know at the same time. They are aware of aspects of the world that are a little bit shadowy, and they choose not to engage with them.","As soon as you make some films that people like, you'll be sent material, and that can come from anywhere.","You can throw away your script more easily than you can throw away your film.","When I read 'Room,' I absolutely loved it, and I thought I knew how to make it.","People say that soundstage sets never quite look like reality. But actually, they can. They can be as real as you want as long as you pay attention to the kind of detail that is given for free in a real place.","In something like 'Frank,' which is a comedy, albeit a strange and emotional one, you can absolutely put in deleted scenes, and we did because they were just funny and great, but they weren't necessary in the overall structure.","I'm not setting out to adapt books and work with books, but when really amazing stories come to you in that form, it's really hard to turn away from that.","I'm a bit of a late developer, generally. But the good thing about being a filmmaker is you still count as young all the way through your 40s.","Generally speaking, the misfit's story is easier to tell.","I remember a Q&A I did in Wales where there were five people in the auditorium.","I'm looking for an intensity of focus. It's a bit like tuning a guitar string. You tighten and tighten, and nothing really changes until you hit that tension, and suddenly it's there: you've got a note.","Films should have the capacity to bring you into another world.","I'm Irish; I grew up in Ireland, and it's impossible to separate my background from who I am as a filmmaker.","Ireland is a good place to start out as a filmmaker. If what you do is good, even at a very small scale, it will get recognized.","As far as the international industry is concerned, I don't think people care at all where you are from - if the work interests them.","I've never worked in the U.K. television industry, but my guess it that it's a tough world for directors.","Cinema at its best can express something of the pure irreducible fact of things.","Shooting 'Adam & Paul' was very tough. There was barely enough time, and the budget was tiny. On top of that, we shot in dangerous locations where we had little or no control or security.","The process of shooting - of choosing shots - is intuitive for me, and I just feel my way towards what seems right.","As a filmmaker, I've sat on the other side, and I've watched when people I know have a film, and it's doing really well, and people are talking about it in all the trades, and everybody is excited about it, and I've always thought, 'Hmm, what would that be like?'","There's so much pressure on kids to perform and to be the best they can be, and particularly with boys: boys who are the gifted ones get loaded with an awful lot of expectation and self-expectation, and that's really hard for an 18 year old.","I'm a bit of a pessimist, oh yeah, and I always think the film I'm about to make is going to be a disaster.","Delusion is not good; better to be realistic and then surprise yourself if you're lucky.","Good filmmakers make bad films; it happens.","The style of direction in 'Room,' maybe a little bit like 'Spotlight,' tries to be hidden.","I think, as directors, they may recognize, more than the rest of the body of filmmakers, exactly what you do as a director, because I think sometimes the conception is if the camera isn't swinging around, and it's not pyrotechnic or worthily melodramatic, then the direction is uninvolved.","Trying to make something as tricky as 'Room' really believable is extremely hard, and it largely rests with that relationship between the actors and the director, and the director and the crew.","I'm a big fan of American vaudeville and Hollywood silent film-era slapstick and the music halls full of ridiculous, eccentric characters.","Most of my work has been independent movies outside the mainstream system.","I am an unusual Irishman. I'm probably Ireland's third most famous Jewish son.","I did go to cheder and was a bar mitzvah. We were members of an Orthodox synagogue, although we were not religious. My grandfather was Polish. He came to Ireland in the '30s.","There's a fashion for a macho style of filmmaking. How long can your longest take be? And shooting things in one shot. For me, if you can sort of disappear and make people feel that they are there, that involves massive amounts of work.","I love the cinema, but I'm not a fascist about it. I've had some of my best experiences watching things on TV. But if I were Stalin, I would force everyone to be in the theater.","I think digital is getting so much better. It's harder and harder to make the argument now for film. All things being equal, though, I still prefer to capture on film.","It drove me as a kid. I couldn't bear the idea that I wasn't the smartest. Then I got put in a B stream for four years at my school. And that was the making of me in a weird way.","Having started in sciences, I then turned around and said, 'Oh, I don't want to do sciences. I want to do philosophy.' And to their credit my parents said, 'if that's what you want to do, then go for it'. Then I got the scholarship to Stanford, which was very nice for the parents to talk to their friends about.","I started to make some commercials, which was a way for me to finally make a living at last. But it was only really a couple of films in that it looked like a viable career option.","When we say 'cinematic', we tend to think John Ford and vistas and wide-open spaces. Or we think of kinetic camera movement or of a certain number of cinematic styles, like film noir.","I always felt there was a kind of humanistic impulse in my thinking about film as well as a real interest in its formal and aesthetic properties - just this idea that it can bring you into a very intimate encounter with people.","I know that it's axiomatic in the film industry that you're not supposed to let the novelist develop their own story. Well, first of all, that's kind of up to the novelist - because they don't have to sell it. But also, I don't believe it. It's about trust.","'Room' was a particularly cohesive group, crew and cast.","I'm interested in discontinuities and interruptions, people having to rewrite the narrative of their lives because of sudden changes.","I'm fascinated by people who have to reinvent themselves. I did it a few times - I was going to be a physicist before I was passionate about philosophy - and I realized that one more change, and I'm going to start looking like a dilettante.","'Room' is a very subtly-made film, and directing awards tend to go to the flashier stuff, but it's the Director's section of the academy that make the decision, so I'm very proud they can see something in what I directed and wanted to reward it.","The title, the name Frank, comes from this extraordinary British character Frank Friedbottom. He was very big in Britain in the '80s, but I, as an Irish kid, saw him on 'Top of the Charts.'","I usually shower the night before, lay out all my clothes on the floor, so then I just fall into them, clean my teeth, stumble out the door, get into my car and go wherever it is that we're shooting. You have breakfast on set.","When you're shooting, there's terrible pressure, and you never switch off. Every day is like the day before an exam; it's relentless.","I was a bachelor for a long time, and I got into all these really lazy habits work-wise. I'd just work as long as I wanted into the night. There was no structure.","I went to Poland for the Warsaw Film Festival, and it was quite an intense experience. I didn't think it would be, but it did feel quite emotional to go back to this place I'd heard so much about.","I'm not an academic type in term of personality. I had my share of madness as a teenager.","I think people like to have their categories clear. They want to know if it's fiction or fact, biopic or not.","The thing about America - it's different everywhere, but visually, it's amazing to shoot in the desert in the New Mexico light. It's really hard to shoot in that desert and make anything look not amazing.","On your first film, you think these are going to be your closest friends for the rest of your life. You form a bond, but then you go back to the rest of your life.","Established actors will challenge you if they don't agree with the way you are taking it, and you have to argue it. But with a younger cast, they are more likely to wonder whether what they are doing is okay instead of trying to second guess the director. That helps push you.","Hollywood is probably the most active centre of film-making in the world, but it's also a very difficult place in which to find your voice... It was also a far more civilised industry in Ireland.","If you're in Hollywood, with no track record, it's pretty odds-on that you can get swamped and overwhelmed by the sheer scale of it all; particularly with the intense commercial push that you feel there.","There was a golden era in film-making in Hollywood back in the 1970s, and although there is some great independent film-making in America, it's actually very hard to get independent films made in the United States. It's much more feasible from Europe.","I was interested in the narrative of how we nurture our elite in this society: all that stuff about believing in yourself and not accepting second best. Our inner world is at odds with that.","After 'Adam and Paul,' I had offers from American agents, but I think I would have been swallowed up.","I wanted to make films that were culturally relevant in my own country, that challenged people, and that people talked about.","As a small kid, I had this huge desire to be thought of as really clever.","I can think back to being four or five and not wanting to sit at the kids' table because I thought it was demeaning. I was this ridiculous little kid.","I came from a classic, literate, intellectual Jewish family.","Although I was really interested in physics, I think I wanted to do it because I thought it was really hard. I did theoretical physics."],"Lenny Bruce":["When you're eight years old nothing is your business.","I'm not a comedian. And I'm not sick. The world is sick, and I'm the doctor. I'm a surgeon with a scalpel for false values.","If God made the body, and the body is dirty, then the fault lies with the manufacturer.","I hate small towns because once you've seen the cannon in the park there's nothing else to do.","The only honest art form is laughter, comedy. You can't fake it... try to fake three laughs in an hour - ha ha ha ha ha - they'll take you away, man. You can't.","The 'what should be' never did exist, but people keep trying to live up to it. There is no 'what should be,' there is only what is.","All my humor is based on destruction and despair. If the whole world were tranquil, without disease and violence, I'd be standing in the bread line - right in back of J. Edgar Hoover.","I don't have an act. I just talk. I'm just Lenny Bruce.","In the Halls of Justice the only justice is in the halls.","I'll die young, but it's like kissing God.","Communism is like one big phone company.","The liberals can understand everything but people who don't understand them.","Satire is tragedy plus time. You give it enough time, the public, the reviewers will allow you to satirize it. Which is rather ridiculous, when you think about it.","Miami Beach is where neon goes to die.","I don't read enough books, so I guess I'm pretty shallow. I'm a lot into the physical. With me, first attraction is never intellectual.","I would be with a bunch of Kennedy fans watching the debate, and their comment would be, 'He's really slaughtering Nixon.' Then we would all go to another apartment, and the Nixon fans would say, 'How do you like the shellacking he gave Kennedy?'","A lot of people say to me, 'Why did you kill Christ?' I dunno, it was one of those parties, got out of hand, you know.","If you can take the hot lead enema, then you can cast the first stone.","Every day people are straying away from the church and going back to God.","There are never enough I Love You's.","Today, I give my daughter what I really didn't have as a kid: all the silly, dumb, extravagant, frilly, nonfunctional toys I can force on her. She probably wants an encyclopedia.","If Jesus had been killed twenty years ago, Catholic school children would be wearing little electric chairs around their necks instead of crosses.","The only truly anonymous donor is the guy who knocks up your daughter.","I won't say ours was a tough school, but we had our own coroner. We used to write essays like: What I'm going to be if I grow up.","The role of a comedian is to make the audience laugh, at a minimum of once every fifteen seconds."],"Lenny Kravitz":["Music is my life, it is a reflection of what I go through.","I just need to know that I did the very best I could and that I was true to myself.","You're never promised your next breath.","We weren't put here to be miserable. We were put here to do the best we can, and we should take our energy and improve our state of being.","Every night is different, you never know what it's going to be like. I remember every night. I don't like to compare them.","People always accuse me of being motivational in a way, like it was a bad thing, but that's just how I was raised. My mom raised me in a positive environment, with lots of love in my heart, and that reflects in my music.","Change is growth. For me it has been a very spiritual and musical rebirth.","When I was a kid and I bought a record, I ripped that thing open, I wanted to know who was playing what, what studio it was cut at, who was the string arranger, who was the engineer.","God gave me the gift to be able to play instruments and I have to play.","If you ask a hundred people, they all give you different answers.","Race in this country is still the elephant in the room that no one wants to discuss.","I was taught by my grandfather that anything that your mind can conceive, you can have. It's a reality.","My dream is to become a farmer. Just a Bohemian guy pulling up his own sweet potatoes for dinner.","I am not trying to change the world. I am just offering my gift that God gave me, and if somebody is moved by it, that's beautiful.","I made the record that my life had me make. Each one is like a diary.","Oasis are not just influenced by the Beatles; they actually take stuff. Then they get praised.","A dramatic thing, the first time you stand up to your dad.","I think it'd be a real nightmare to put a record out and sell 20 million copies and then that's it.","I have a great time with my band and on the stage we get along well.","If you listen to a lot of old funk records, the drums are really small. But you don't perceive it like that because the groove is so heavy.","People see my photos and think I labor over my image and I'm this cool, brooding artist. But I'm just having fun with it.","It's a trip to have a Greatest Hits record. It's a trip.","I identify with women more than men. I guess I have a strong feminine side.","I don't play the tuba.","I wouldn't play together with someone who likes to control everything like me.","It's like a dream to come to Spain and stay for a couple of years and get somebody to teach me Spanish music.","I don't think about the styles. I write whatever comes out and I use whatever kind of instrumentation works for those songs.","I couldn't tell you what I am going to do next 'cause I have no idea, but I am open to anything.","The image that the public gets is whatever they perceive it to be. Everybody has an opinion, everybody has their own vision, so I don't know what my public image is. I have no idea.","That's a big gift when people say to you that a song helped them or brought them to some place in their life where they needed to be.","I am still into the people I listened to growing up, so I completely remember what is like to be a fan, I haven't changed.","I wasn't the kind of person that liked waiting for autographs or following them, I just liked to go to the shows, study their records, driving many, many hours to different states to go to concerts.","I am trying to get closer to God.","There's definitely an old school element to my music, but I also think it's modern.","I never sit down to write. When I'm moved, I do it. I just wait for it to come. You just hear it. I can't really describe writing. It's in my head.","I've woken up from dreams and the whole song is there. I'm listening to it in my dreams. I consciously have to wake myself up and get a tape recorder because I hear it like a record.","My first guitar, a Fender Jazz Master, I traded it in for a Les Paul Deluxe.","They think I'm being serious when actually I'm a very big clown. But you have to know me to see that. I'm constantly cracking up and cracking everybody else around me up.","It was amazing to me that, all of a sudden, I was hearing my music on the radio and coming out of cars.","I'm always sort of reflecting on what I do on what I've done. Usually before I make a new album, I'll listen to the previous albums just to see where I've been.","My career has been a gradual climb. I think that's part of the reason why I've had longevity.","I knew Slash in high school, but not very well. Just knew him as this kid that used to hang out in the hallway. Pretty much looked then the way he does now.","My mother gave lots of good advice and had a lot to say. As you get older, you realize everything she said was true.","There are so many people that don't believe in themselves and don't have faith.","If I had to associate myself with one song, it would probably be Let Love Rule. It's so simple and to the point. It speaks for itself.","We're getting so pulled in by computers and technology, and our kids have their face in the computers all day. The human relationship is being diminished by this.","I feel like I'm only in the beginning of my career. I've only made five albums. It's not a lot.","I'm more hungry now than I was 11 years ago. Which is great because I see a lot of artists that have been out for a long period of time. They get kind of fat.","The story that I wanna tell is pretty much about the way I grew up. Being bi-racial, growing up in a big city and being an artist.","It's very important to vote. People died for this right.","For the last few years, it's been so chic for everybody to be miserable. Like if you're in with the cool crowd, you can't be happy.","God forbid you sing about love. It's a lost concept.","God is always in my life, and that's the most important thing to me.","I mean, there are only so many notes. What makes something original is how you put it together.","I've been compared to hundreds of artists, which just goes to show you that I'm not any one thing at all.","If I were white, I'd get less criticism.","I'm half Jewish, I'm half black, I look in-between. I dress funny. I play all these different styles of music on one record. It's like, What is he doing?","Confusion makes people uncomfortable. They can't put their finger on me.","I knew what I wanted to do from the time I was 5.","Today, people are more into the glitz and the glamour of everything. We don't even read the inside of records anymore.","You can be around 100 people and be completely alone. People don't realize what it's really like.","The image is an image.","I'm in this for the long haul. I've been making music my whole life.","I've had to work very hard, and I don't really have a category or fit into any niche, so each time I come out with a new record, it's like, I'm a new guy.","The loyalty rate isn't that high. I could have a big hit, then put out the next single, and they say, Oh yeah, who are you? Prove it again.","A lot of people don't listen to the lyrics, really.","A lot of people pretty much only listen to the chorus.","The fans of 'The Hunger Games,' of the book, are very passionate. It's funny: Even at my concerts there are people holding up 'Cinna' signs.","Where I'm at in life, the women have got to come with something else, not just the body, but the mind and spirit. It usually trips them out, but that's the way it's going to be. I'm looking at the big picture.","Are things getting better with each generation? Yes. It's quite interesting to be living in these times, for me to witness an African-American being elected president. It's quite extraordinary.","The thing I love about acting is that it's got nothing to do with me; it's about bringing forth a director's vision. It's like a release. I'm glad it's come back into my life.","I always try to keep the circumstances in my life fresh. I like to change the physical environment I live in, change the people around me and try to experience things for the first time. I think that keeps one on their toes, creatively and spiritually.","People don't realize it, but no one lives that rock and roll life 24-7. They think it's hundreds of bottles of champagne flowing and private jets and money. But there's a lot of time when you're traveling - time to think, time to be lonely. Sometimes it gets to you.","If you look at the guys in the '70s, like Led Zeppelin, they had bigger planes than we do, they had more money. But they weren't singing about it.","I mean, look at the people we celebrate - a lot of people who really don't do anything. They just walk the red carpets and go to all the parties, and they're hooked up with the right people, so they're celebrities. But what for?"],"Lenny Platt":["For most couples, the first event they plan together is their wedding.","When you audition for 'Quantico,' they have the academy application manual and maps of the base in the waiting room. So right from the start, they have you doing research, which I thought was cool.","I'm an 'SNL' junkie, and being backstage and seeing how it works behind the curtain for a couple days was something I'll never forget.","'OLTL' was a bootcamp for me, and I was lucky to be a part of it. It was a great experience and met great long-term friends from it.","There was a show at Sesame Place where you could lay down on mat in front of a blue screen, and the monitor would show you flying with Super Grover. I must have been five years old when I did it, and I still remember it. Likely the origins of my acting bug.","Shredder is about as evil as it gets. He is a man fueled by jealousy and rage. At the same time, he doesn't micromanage, so his gang is free to do what they want.","My LinkedIn page looks crazy."],"Lenny Wilkens":["The American dream, to me, means having the opportunity to achieve, because I don't think you should be guaranteed anything other than opportunity.","If you want it, you've got to give it.","I worry about the things I can affect, and the things I have no control over I move by.","Intimidation doesn't last very long.","If you can't go through it, find a way around it. Don't spend all your time banging your head.","If you fail the first time that's just a chance to start over again.","We should never discourage young people from dreaming dreams.","I never really had a chance to know the players individually... I thought when they were on the floor, they worked hard. But I never really got to know them."],"Lenora Crichlow":["I don't really follow fashion exactly, but I've always been very interested in the way that you present yourself as an expression of yourself, so that's my idea of fashion and style from a personal point of view.","Obviously because of my personal connection to Mandela and having had his story as part of my childhood, I knew how awesome he was.","There's nothing like meeting someone's family to get a true sense of them and a reflection of their ethics and personality. It just makes them a more rounded person.","I've always been interested in fashion, the clothes, but I'm not that familiar with the fashion industry; for me it just comes out of quite an innocent sense of style.","Every girl's dream is to have two hot guys having a bit of a barney over you.","I love art, but I'm not an academic; I just like what I like."],"Leo Aikman":["The shortest distance between two points is under construction.","You can tell more about a person by what he says about others than you can by what others say about him.","The best way to break a bad habit is to drop it."],"Leo Baekeland":["I was trying to make something really hard, but then I thought I should make something really soft instead, that could be molded into different shapes. That was how I came up with the first plastic. I called it Bakelite.","Well, it was kind of an accident, because plastic is not what I meant to invent. I had just sold photograph paper to Eastman Kodak for 1 million dollars.","Then I was president of the Bakelite Corporation from 1910 to 1930.","In 1893 I founded a chemical company which I ran until 1899.","I also served on many government committees."],"Leo Bogart":["The Great Idea in advertising is far more than the sum of the recognition scores, the ratings and all the other superficial indicators of its success; it is in the realm of myth, to which measurements cannot apply.","Advertisements may be evaluated scientifically; they cannot be created scientifically.","In my opinion, fun is what makes advertising successful."],"Leo Burnett":["Good advertising does not just circulate information. It penetrates the public mind with desires and belief.","Make it simple. Make it memorable. Make it inviting to look at. Make it fun to read.","When you reach for the stars you may not quite get one, but you won't come up with a handful of mud either.","To swear off making mistakes is very easy. All you have to do is swear off having ideas.","I am one who believes that one of the greatest dangers of advertising is not that of misleading people, but that of boring them to death.","We want consumers to say, 'That's a hell of a product' instead of, 'That's a hell of an ad.'","There's no such thing as 'hard sell' and 'soft sell.' There's only 'smart sell' and 'stupid sell.'","Advertising is the ability to sense, interpret... to put the very heart throbs of a business into type, paper and ink.","Advertising says to people, 'Here's what we've got. Here's what it will do for you. Here's how to get it.'","Curiosity about life in all of its aspects, I think, is still the secret of great creative people.","The work of an advertising agency is warmly and immediately human. It deals with human needs, wants, dreams and hopes. Its 'product' cannot be turned out on an assembly line.","The secret of all effective originality in advertising is not the creation of new and tricky words and pictures, but one of putting familiar words and pictures into new relationships.","What helps people, helps business.","I have learned that you can't have good advertising without a good client, that you can't keep a good client without good advertising, and no client will ever buy better advertising than he understands or has an appetite for.","The greatest thing to be achieved in advertising, in my opinion, is believability, and nothing is more believable than the product itself.","Regardless of the moral issue, dishonesty in advertising has proved very unprofitable.","Fun without sell gets nowhere but sell without fun tends to become obnoxious.","A good basic selling idea, involvement and relevancy, of course, are as important as ever, but in the advertising din of today, unless you make yourself noticed and believed, you ain't got nothin'.","I have learned to respect ideas, wherever they come from. Often they come from clients. Account executives often have big creative ideas, regardless of what some writers think.","The secret of all effective advertising is not the creation of new and tricky words and pictures, but one of putting familiar words and pictures into new relationships.","If you don't get noticed, you don't have anything. You just have to be noticed, but the art is in getting noticed naturally, without screaming or without tricks.","If you can't turn yourself into your customer, you probably shouldn't be in the ad writing business at all.","Plan the sale when you plan the ad.","I regard a great ad as the most beautiful thing in the world.","Too many ads that try not to go over the reader's head end up beneath his notice.","I have learned that it is far easier to write a speech about good advertising than it is to write a good ad.","I have learned that any fool can write a bad ad, but that it takes a real genius to keep his hands off a good one.","Creative ideas flourish best in a shop which preserves some spirit of fun. Nobody is in business for fun, but that does not mean there cannot be fun in business.","There is no such thing as a permanent advertising success.","Anyone who thinks that people can be fooled or pushed around has an inaccurate and pretty low estimate of people - and he won't do very well in advertising.","The sole purpose of business is service. The sole purpose of advertising is explaining the service which business renders.","A good ad which is not run never produces sales.","Whether or not the standard of living made possible by mass production and in turn by mass circulation, is supported by and filled with the work of us hucksters, I guess is something that only history can decide.","I have learned that trying to guess what the boss or the client wants is the most debilitating of all influences in the creation of good advertising."],"Leo Buscaglia":["Your talent is God's gift to you. What you do with it is your gift back to God.","Change is the end result of all true learning.","Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.","A single rose can be my garden... a single friend, my world.","Worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow, it only saps today of its joy.","The fact that I can plant a seed and it becomes a flower, share a bit of knowledge and it becomes another's, smile at someone and receive a smile in return, are to me continual spiritual exercises.","Love is life. And if you miss love, you miss life.","Only the weak are cruel. Gentleness can only be expected from the strong.","The purpose of life is to help others, and if you can't help them, won't you at least not hurt them? I know that is a platitude, that that is sentimental and can easily be attacked. But loving, caring is simple, and we make it complex. Our own neuroses make it complex.","Don't brood. Get on with living and loving. You don't have forever.","Never idealize others. They will never live up to your expectations.","Life lived for tomorrow will always be just a day away from being realized.","The easiest thing to be in the world is you. The most difficult thing to be is what other people want you to be. Don't let them put you in that position.","I have too much respect for people to try to control them. But they are estranged from love, afraid to reach out and touch one another. We're afraid to appear sentimental or speak in platitudes because people will say, 'What a jerk!' It takes courage in our culture to be a lover.","Hugs make you feel psychologically more secure and together.","We all need each other.","Love is always bestowed as a gift - freely, willingly and without expectation. We don't love to be loved; we love to love.","Love is always open arms. If you close your arms about love you will find that you are left holding only yourself.","I still get wildly enthusiastic about little things... I play with leaves. I skip down the street and run against the wind.","We are no longer puppets being manipulated by outside powerful forces: we become the powerful force ourselves.","Biologically and physiologically, we are not equal. Some of us learn better at different times of day. Some learn best visually, some auditorially, some tactilely, by touching.","Don't smother each other. No one can grow in the shade.","Death is a challenge. It tells us not to waste time... It tells us to tell each other right now that we love each other.","What we call the secret of happiness is no more a secret than our willingness to choose life.","I have been a teacher myself all my life. I have an intense passion to share with people. Our only salvation is in knowledge, in learning.","I am a teacher. And I think I am a serious one who happens to be enjoying life.","Love always creates, it never destroys. In this lies man's only promise.","When we sit at the table, there is more going on than satisfying hunger. It is sad to think of those who eat simply to satisfy their hunger and who do not permit themselves to linger under the many spells offered by a good meal - the satisfaction of our hearts, our minds and our spirits.","If you're an advocate of gentleness, you're simplistic and naive. If you're an advocate of despair and hate, you're sophisticated.","I have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate - it's apathy. It's not giving a damn.","If I don't have wisdom, I can teach you only ignorance.","The best students come from homes where education is revered: where there are books, and children see their parents reading them.","Food is celebratory. People who don't cook don't know how much fun they're missing.","I got the copyright for love!","I believe that you control your destiny, that you can be what you want to be. You can also stop and say, 'No, I won't do it, I won't behave his way anymore. I'm lonely and I need people around me, maybe I have to change my methods of behaving,' and then you do it.","It is paradoxical that many educators and parents still differentiate between a time for learning and a time for play without seeing the vital connection between them.","All of my youth growing up in my Italian family was focused around the table. That's where I learned about love.","The minute we stop learning, we begin death, the process of dying. We learn from each other with every action we perform. We are teaching goodness or evil every time we step out of the house and into the street.","I was lucky to have such a loving, crazy family. I learned to give and share.","What love we've given, we'll have forever. What love we fail to give, will be lost for all eternity.","I've learned that you learn best by modeling. If you want people to learn, do it!","My mother made soft polenta often, and as a child, I would watch her stir until she looked like her arm would fall off.","We want to gently remind people that we don't have forever. In my work, I hear parents complain all the time that their children grow up so fast. But they don't take the time to sit down and talk to each other. The last bastion of getting together is around the table.","I've always thought that people need to feel good about themselves and I see my role as offering support to them, to provide some light along the way.","If we wish to free ourselves from enslavement, we must choose freedom and the responsibility this entails.","You can be a follower of Muhammad or Jesus or Buddha or whomever. Always, they said that the most essential factor is to love your neighbor. And to love you.","The way to anybody's heart is through a thoughtfully-prepared, beautifully-executed, lovingly-presented meal.","I've spoken in every state in the union, meeting and hugging the people who later bought my books. I spoke to anybody who wanted to hear me, including 1,000 nuns who could pay me only with homemade bread."],"Leo Durocher":["I believe in rules. Sure I do. If there weren't any rules, how could you break them?","Baseball is like church. Many attend few understand.","Show me a good loser and I'll show you an idiot.","There are only five things you can do in baseball - run, throw, catch, hit and hit with power.","I come to win.","I never questioned the integrity of an umpire. Their eyesight, yes.","I never did say that you can't be a nice guy and win. I said that if I was playing third base and my mother rounded third with the winning run, I'd trip her up.","You argue with the umpire because there is nothing else you can do about it.","You don't save a pitcher for tomorrow. Tomorrow it may rain.","God watches over drunks and third baseman.","I made a game effort to argue but two things were against me: the umpires and the rules.","Winning is a habit.","Nice guys finish last.","Buy a steak for a player on another club after the game, but don't even speak to him on the field. Get out there and beat them to death.","Give me some scratching, diving, hungry ballplayers who come to kill you.","How you play the game is for college ball. When you're playing for money, winning is the only thing that matters.","If you don't win, you're going to be fired. If you do win, you've only put off the day you're going to be fired.","In the olden days, the umpire didn't have to take any courses in mind reading. The pitcher told you he was going to throw at you.","Nobody ever won a pennant without a star shortstop.","Some guys are admired for coming to play, as the saying goes. I prefer those who come to kill.","What are we out at the park for, except to win?","Win any way you can as long as you can get away with it.","As long as I've got a chance to beat you I'm going to take it.","You can't get any pictures from way back there."],"Leo Fender":["If something is easy to repair, it is easy to construct.","The design of each element should be thought out in order to be easy to make and easy to repair.","Let there be bass.","I wonder if I could make an electric bass."],"Leo Fitzpatrick":["I met Roger Ebert at an independent-film awards or something. And he said, 'When I saw you just now, I wanted to punch you in the face. And then I had to remember you're an actor. So, congratulations!' Those are my accolades.","I never went to school for art or was told what to like or when. So every day is a learning process, like most of life.","I'm not an artist or a collector. I'm a skateboard kid with no one to tell me if I'm not doing things the right way.","I've known Larry Clark since I was fourteen. I've always skateboarded in Manhattan. Larry got into the scene in the early '90s, taking pictures and skating with us.","Miramax didn't introduce the actors at any of the screenings. That's why a lot of people thought 'Kids' was a documentary. I still meet people who think it was real.","I had no money. I just figured out hustles to get by, like maybe selling my clothes. I wanted to travel around and be broke and live in sketchy apartments.","The last thing I wanna do is sit home and watch television.","Two of my favorite artists are Josh Smith and Joe Bradley. But I argued against them for years, until I grew to love them and felt stupid for my immediate reaction towards their work.","I just thought it made sense to call a book 'Not Garbage,' even though the majority of it was going to be the scraps from people's studios; like newspaper clippings, weird drawings and stuff they might not necessarily show as artists.","Ray Johnson was a great innovator of mail art and photocopying and sending people photocopies.","I was a very close friend of Dash Snow's, so whenever I get a chance to revisit his work, that's always amazing for me."],"Leo Howard":["Being confident is the key to life. Don't be afraid to be you! I'm super different from a lot of kids my age with style and personality, and I'm OK with it. And if you are OK with it, everyone else will be, too. Just be yourself.","I love performing, and I love being in front of people. I love the pressure you get and the pleasure performing brings.","It was fantastic playing Conan; it was such an experience to go out of the country and be this barbaric human savage child for a month or so. It was a blast and definitely a great experience.","I would be nowhere without martial arts. It's a passion.","I was bullied in first grade, and it's definitely not fun. But always tell somebody instead of holding it in. Communicate with people and just say, 'Hey, I'm being bullied. I need help.'","Don't give in to all the cliques and popularity. It means nothing. I know super popular guys, and guess what? They're just normal people, too.","If you're OK with being clumsy, it's funny.

If you can look at that and think it might be fun then maybe you've got the right musician.","Yeah, the first thing that comes to mind is not to try too hard.","When a record company looks at me I'm very hard to market, I don't really fit anywhere, It's hard to get me on the air, and I'm hard to demography, but! because of that I'm not subject to trends like you pointed out.","I'm not subject to their rise and fall because I'm not accepted by them, so I have my own little curve going on.

That is really the only reason that I'm writing music.","Hopefully, I have a certain amount of what you call musical talent.","I think there have been some periods when the writing almost became a bit of a burden.","The danger of that - and there's a grave danger that I, myself, have to be very aware of - is that you become so involved and intrigued in the language that sometimes you lose track that that is only a means to an aesthetic experience that the listener has to get.","By the visual pattern, but mostly I'm guided entirely by my ear, what I hear.","Now, there are sometimes making a connection between one section and another that sometimes you do want to see the pattern because it helps you to lead into the next thing - it's a rhetorical thing, where you just see how the pattern has to go into the next thing.","But in the end, music is ultimately an aural art, pure and simple.","When I was speaking about communicating, I meant that the listener - we have to reach the listener; otherwise, of course, you're writing the piece, as I say, only for the satisfaction of seeing it on the paper for yourself, and then it ends right there.","Now, what we are not talking about, what you're really coming to, is what compromises one makes so that the listener understands somewhat of what you're doing, what you're trying to express.","You write it down because finally, when it's written down you do get it out of your system somewhat.","A person improvising is sometimes very fortunate that just at that second things coincide.","In writing music, the structure of each piece is a very important factor.","Besides merely some pleasure that we get out of the combinations of pitches together and lines, I think that there is some satisfaction that we get in the fact of having this diffuse thing organized very concretely and put onto a frame and have it actually decided.","I distrust anything that you don't hear.","Because essentially Schoenberg was an extremely gifted man. And in spite of many of his theories and so on, when he really began to write music, he still was guided very much by his internal hearing, by what we call your internal ear.","We can use techniques in modifying things, in controlling things, but the first impulse has to be something that you simply cannot make just out of technique, or else it becomes perfectly evident that it is nothing but technique that you're exercising.","The difference between the student and the born composer is he really hears the thing, and they have to stage it and manipulate it by technical equipment.","By the way, the point between rationality and what we would call the irrational is a very difficult point to establish. There's no specific line, as you know.","No, I think that a person writes a poem because they have an inner urge of something that they want to express, and I think it's that inner urge that you want to express when you write a piece of music.","Well, no. I believe that it's not at all impossible that some of the performances that I've heard so far by some pianists may be superior to my own playing because those are two totally different acts altogether.","It doesn't necessarily mean at all that the composer plays his own works best.","To the person that deals in visualizations, I suppose there is something rather exciting about a whole set of people - they all going symmetrically, up or down, in a military sort of precision.","There are some people, by the way, that associate a certain amount of visualization with the performance of music. Those are people that really are not centrally concerned only with music, the traditional things.","I think recordings have been a terrific advance because now, when you have a piece of music, particularly something that appears to the listener very complicated, there's really a push to the world to try to figure out what it was that he was hearing.","Today, with a recording, he can hear the thing enough times until he really gets acquainted with the language, and then he can begin to make an estimate of the intrinsic, aesthetic value of that piece of music."],"Leo Rosten":["Some things are so unexpected that no one is prepared for them.","We see things as we are, not as they are.","I learned that it is the weak who are cruel, and that gentleness is to be expected only from the strong.","Truth is stranger than fiction; fiction has to make sense.","Courage is the capacity to confront what can be imagined.","I never cease being dumbfounded by the unbelievable things people believe.","Any man who hates dogs and babies can't be all bad.","First-rate people hire first-rate people; second-rate people hire third-rate people.","Humor is the affectionate communication of insight.","Words must surely be counted among the most powerful drugs man ever invented.","Satire is focused bitterness.","A writer writes not because he is educated but because he is driven by the need to communicate.

I think you're supposed to say an ambulance man or a footballer or a soldier or something like that, and I told all my mother's friends that I wanted to be Minister for Health.

No minister can. And never will be able to.","Obviously, nobody likes to read or hear about anyone having a bad experience in our hospitals.","When a hospital isn't under as much pressure, you start to see things slowing down, and it might take five, six, seven days to get the person discharged, and that's the length of stay, so it's all these different factors come into play all the time.","When a hospital is very crowded, there will be a real push to make sure people get their X-rays, get their tests and, you know, 'Let's get them out in four days'.","I don't see myself in politics at 51. I definitely want to do something else.","Politicians should trust people with the truth. Very often, we don't do that.","We have an educated and cynical electorate.","I decided early on to be honest and trust people with the truth.","I find it scary when people talk about me as a future leader.

For the members of all other cults, there was neither law nor mercy.","All men equal in rights and duties, all men equally responsible for the destiny of mankind - what a dream!","Movements such as the Pan-Germanic, Pan-Islamic, or Pan-Negro justify themselves on the basis of their common language, or their common religion, or their color. But since the undefined masses involved in these movements lack the essential and real unity of background or community of purpose, they become a grave danger to general peace.","Just as the formation of the family is basic to the formation of the state, so the states themselves are the only units that can form the basic constitution of a viable international organization."],"Leon Bridges":["My whole life is a vacation.","A lot of R&B cats are doing a lot of auto-tune. Tyrese went back to the basics. I love classic soul music and Ginuwine. Ginuwine and Usher laid the foundation back in the '90s. There's no one doing that anymore.","I've always had a very clear vision of what I wanted to do.","I like to wear short-sleeved collared shirts and high-waist trousers with shiny shoes. And at night, when I'm playing, I'll often wear suits. But it started with my uncle's vintage clothes.","I don't live in this soul music bubble. I love Young Thug, Drake, Kendrick Lamar. I even heard that Kendrick was a fan of my music. Hopefully there's a door open for us to do music together. He's one of my favorite artists. I love Jazmine Sullivan, Lianne la Havas, Usher, Ginuwine. It goes further than classic soul.","I think I'll always live in Fort Worth. It's great that I can now go anywhere I want to play music, but I love coming back here. I can roll down the streets and just reminisce.","I like to groove a little bit!","Gospel music played a huge part of my life. I was too scared to audition for the choir, but through my own music, I was also able to find spirituality for myself.","People have this perception of soul music of somebody shouting.","One time, when I was about eight, these guys started throwing water balloons at me. That really did ruin my summer.","The heart of man will always be dark. There will always be evil people. The problem is that there is nothing we can humanly do to change them.","I write based on how I feel.","I've always had a great work ethic, even when I was washing dishes.","I was 10 years old when I first heard Ginuwine. I remember being at a friend's house, and the music video came on. I was just like, 'What is that?' I was just kind of drawn from there.","The first time I heard Sam Cooke was in the 'Malcom X' film. I was with my father, and that's the first time I heard his song. I remember my father telling me the story of Sam Cooke.","I remember hanging out at Starbucks. There were these older guys who would sit around and play Crosby, Stills & Nash songs. I was just so in love with music. I would just go hang out with them, and I would try to sing and harmonize with them. I didn't even know the songs.","It's kind of weird - I get shy when I'm around new people, still, even when I'm onstage. I come from not really wanting to be in lights or known or in front of people.","I love the pioneers like Sam Cooke and Otis Redding, but when I write music, it comes out in my own way.","If I went crazy and tried to make pop music, my band wouldn't record it! I love them too much to do that.","I never really thought about my music being universal. When I set out to write, it was just a feeling that felt good to me. I never thought about being able to reach everybody.","In the beginning, I was so inspired by the music. I had the option to make something modern with classic undertones, but I wanted to make something that was exactly like that old sound.","I always wanted the world to hear my music, but I didn't know how I was gonna go about it.","I'm coming from a Ginuwine and Usher background: slow and smooth songs. And that's why I really connected to Sam Cooke, because he was just very smooth. It's not like the James Brown types, which is all great stuff, but he was totally set apart from those guys.","My father would play Stevie Wonder in the car, but that never sunk in.","I've just always been around great songwriters. To me, they were the standard.","I believe that gospel is more than just a sound, it's a way of life. I don't really have any shame to talk about spirituality in my music. A lot of your favorite soul songs started out in gospel.","When I write, I talk about stories and things that are happening in my life. I come from the church. There was a time in my life when I actually had that transformation and relationship with God.","My music is more than me writing a flashy soul song. They're heartfelt songs about my family and true stories. I have also songs that aren't personal, but just painting a picture. I don't like being put under labels, but my music is going to continue to stay classic and timeless forever.","The thought of me not having to clock in for a job anymore is something that I can't really put into words, aside from 'amazing' and 'awesome.'","My mom is very excited for the fact that I got signed and, of course, being a mom, she's going to be a little worried.","From the core, I'm a shy person, but when I'm on stage, I know how to put it aside. Of course, I'm not perfect, but I've definitely grown as far as being comfortable on stage.","There are a lot of bands who would get really big in Fort Worth and play shows on a Friday night that everybody would come out to. But I've never been really big in my hometown. My shows would have 10 or 15 people at them.","I was washing dishes at Del Frisco's Grille and busing tables at a Tex-Mex place and writing songs the whole time. I did a lot of my writing at those jobs, thinking up melodies in my head.","I knew I had a gift. I wanted the world to hear my music, and I wanted it to be my career, but I didn't know how to go about it.","My mother and my great-aunt told me stories, like how when my grandfather first met my grandmother at a party, he noticed her long legs and was like, 'Woo woo!' I like to incorporate those stories into my music. They just seem to fit.","I want people to see an honesty within me. I'm not trying to be the next Sam Cooke or Otis Redding.","I'm not trying to compete with any other revival soul acts. It's just Leon Bridges, a kid from Fort Worth trying to be himself and give people hope. It's great music to dance to and just love.","My mom was very religious. She might have let me buy records, but I assumed that she wouldn't.","I wrote my first song, 'Conversion', to this little hip-hop instrumental. I went to an open-mic, plugged my iPod into the P.A., and sang over the beat.","I'm very content to have great management and a great label. But for me, success started when my managers came to me and told me, 'Go ahead and quit your job.' I told them, 'As long as I don't have to wash dishes anymore, I'm good.'","Fame and all that type of stuff is inevitable, but I'm very content having a good band with no negativity, and everyone is on the same page.","My mom is a very religious woman. So when I began recording music, I was afraid she wouldn't accept it. But when I played her a song, she loved it.","Dance really built my confidence on stage. I'm still a shy person. But I have a lot more confidence than I did when I started.","When I started writing the music, I wanted everything to be consistent from the way I dressed to the way I presented myself online. I wanted everything to match what I was doing on stage.","I got tired of depending on other people, and I had this strong desire to make music of my own. I decided to start writing my own tunes and just see what could happen.","When I started writing, I just wanted to do something different and creative. I first thought neo-soul was a good pathway for me, so I tried that out but realized I didn't want to be placed in that box.","I'm totally open to exploring different types of music. I just have to always remember to be true to who I am.","For me, making music just starts with a simple melody, and lyrics will come sometime after that.","When I first got into the music scene, I was inspired by different songwriters. I like to dress from the '50s and '60s. I like to paint a picture of that era through my music and clothes. I am inspired by a whole a lot of things, from doo-wop to gospel and soul music.","The first time I shared my music and style with my mom, she said, 'Boy, you look like you came right out of the 1950s.'","People tell me they use my song 'Coming Home' at their weddings. My audience seems to range from young to old, and it's cool when you really get to connect with all different people.","I shop at thrift stores and consignment shoppes. I wear my clothes as is, and maybe get them dry cleaned whenever possible.","I don't like a lot of attention. That's kind of who I am at heart. So I see everything, the people circulating around me and a lot of people know me - it kind of feels like a heavy weight sometimes.","Because my career has gone so fast, I haven't been able to become confident."],"Leon Charney":["First, we would reposition UPI by bringing it into the 21st century with new technology. And second would be to better utilize its assets, like the library and archives, which have terrific value.","There's a lot of egos in these countries, like the French, the Germans, et cetera, and so they keep funding and rehabilitating Yasser Arafat.","Judaism is a brilliant religion, and the main function of Judaism is to learn and read.","There's no way in the world that the United States does not want to spread democratic ideals, but the first thing we have to do is that which is the interest of our security.","I remember when I was in the Middle East, Yasser Arafat used to go to Bahrain and Qatar on a Thursday and then go to Saudi Arabia and get his financial help on a Saturday.","Can you get a democracy in Saudi Arabia? These people talk about theocracy, not democracy. So I think it's a very tough situation.","The Iraqi war has transformed the Middle East.","Generally, the president's power and capital is used to close a deal and not always to negotiate bit by bit.","I have no doubts, by the way, that Ariel Sharon really wants to move the peace process forward."],"Leon Day":["I was glad to play in the Negro Leagues. I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.","It would mean a lot to me to get into the Hall of Fame, to be grouped with some of the greatest players in history.","I was in Cuba in the winter of 1937. I was playing in Cuba, and I'm in the shower, and I slipped and caught myself with my right arm. I felt something pull right then. Then, in '38, when I came back, my arm was messed up.","Until spring training in 1946, the only time I pitched was in 1945 in the GI World Series."],"Leon Edel":["The answer to old age is to keep one's mind busy and to go on with one's life as if it were interminable. I always admired Chekhov for building a new house when he was dying of tuberculosis.","The biographer who writes the life of his subject's self-concept passes through a fade into the inner house of life.","Any biographer must of necessity become a pilgrim a peripatetic, obsessed literary pilgrim, a traveler with four eyes."],"Leon Foucault":["The phenomenon develops calmly, but it is invisible, unstoppable. One feels, one sees it born and grow steadily; and it is not in one's power to either hasten or slow it down.","Any person, brought into the presence of this fact, stops for a few moments and remains pensive and silent; and then generally leaves, carrying with him forever a sharper, keener sense of our incessant motion through space."],"Leon Gast":["I built a relationship and a rapport with Muhammad Ali, and I could never top that experience.","I knew Ali would beat Foreman - absolutely. At Deer Lake, his fight camp in Pennsylvania, his training sessions were awesome.","Foreman had annihilated every single one of his opponents to that point, but here was Ali, going to Africa, selling himself as the 'real deal' black man.","Ali was actually able to fool some people into thinking that Foreman was actually a white man.","If my parents were to hear that their son won an Academy Award, they'd roll over in their graves. I was the luckiest person, but that luck came through the grace of Muhammad Ali."],"Leon Gorman":["Customer service is just a day-in, day-out, ongoing, never-ending, unremitting, persevering, compassionate type of activity.","Everybody got into the rugged outdoors business and into lifestyle merchandising and so forth and so on. And everybody was getting into catalogs and e-commerce and - you name it. It was just intense.","Oh, we don't have a grandiose marketing plan. We sell products that work, that we like."],"Leon Jaworski":["From Watergate we learned what generations before us have known; our Constitution works. And during Watergate years it was interpreted again so as to reaffirm that no one - absolutely no one - is above the law.","I would rather have a competent extremist than an incompetent moderate."],"Leon Jouhaux":["On completion of my military service, I went back to the factory and to the trade union.","True enough, nature has endowed me with a fair measure of patience and composure, yet I should be lying if I told you that, having seen the reporter off on his way to make his deadline, I fell peacefully asleep.","We too, through lack of knowledge and of sufficiently mature reflection, mistook the visible outward appearance of the phenomenon for the phenomenon itself.","A convention was drawn up on June 17, 1925, in which the principle of supervision, as opposed to that of simple propaganda, was recognized, thanks to the efforts of the labour members, of whom I was one.","From 1918 on, trade unionists were to express from the platforms of their congresses the workers' desire for peace through a rational organization of the world.","Furthermore, it is not distorting history to say that it was largely through the efforts and propaganda of our International Federation that the government of the U.S.S.R. was recognized by the majority of the great powers.","I would not go so far as to say that the French trade unions attached greater importance to the struggle for peace than the others did; but they certainly seemed to take it more to heart.","In the report made on behalf of the C.G.T. we affirmed that the Peace Treaty should, in accordance with the spirit of workers' organizations, lay the first foundations of the United States of Europe.","My parents, and especially my mother, encouraged by the director of the local school which I was attending, wanted in spite of everything to send me to a National School of Arts and Crafts so that I could later become an engineer.","The working classes were becoming more and more sharply aware of the complex causes of international malaise.","This disaster did not force us to abandon our ideal; on the contrary, from the very first months of the conflict, it led us to define precisely the conditions for its realization.","At Leeds the idea of an international labour organization appeared in a trade-union text which also drew attention to the danger to the working classes inherent in the existence of international capitalist competition.","Expressing the thoughts of my comrades, I suggested, among other means, the organization of an international information service on inventories, on production, and on the needs of the various countries for raw materials.","The trade unions, far from being content with these declarations, established international liaisons and supported every policy based on pacification and understanding.","This led me to understand that trade unionism, the instrument of working-class liberation and of social change could, and indeed should, be also an instrument of industrial progress."],"Leon Kass":["Technological innovation is indeed important to economic growth and the enhancement of human possibilities.","Cloning represents a very clear, powerful, and immediate example in which we are in danger of turning procreation into manufacture.","The benefits of biomedical progress are obvious, clear, and powerful. The hazards are much less well appreciated.","Many other countries have already banned human cloning, and there are efforts at the UN to make such a ban universal.","The technical is not just the machinery. The technical is a disposition to life.","Cloning looks like a degrading of parenthood and a perversion of the right relation between parents and children.","Genetics is crude, but neuroscience goes directly to work on the brain, and the mind follows.","I don't believe that efforts to prohibit only so-called reproductive cloning can be successful.","I've been opposed to human cloning from the very beginning.","An enormous amount of direct advertising from pharmaceutical companies are offering a kind of instantaneous solution to problems.","Almost everybody is enthusiastic about the promise of biotechnology to cure disease and to relieve suffering.","It's very hard to make arguments about the effects of cloning on family relations if family relations are in tatters.","The neuroscience area - which is absolutely in its infancy - is much more important than genetics.","I have nothing against respecting people who lived before, but we have no responsibility toward them.","There is a lot of hype and fear about this much-talked-about prospect of designer babies.","If one is seriously interested in preventing reproductive cloning, one must stop the process before it starts.","As bad as it might be to destroy a creature made in God's image, it might be very much worse to be creating them after images of one's own.","Biology, meaning the science of all life, is a late notion.","Even if certain rogue countries do things we wish nobody did, it doesn't necessarily mean that their foolishness should justify our following suit.","I don't like being forced to reduce my thoughts to sound bites.","If you have easy self-contentment, you might have a very, very cheap source of happiness.","Is it possible to covet a much longer life for one's self and be as devoted to the well-being of the next generation? It's a long argument.","It seems to me that a kind of thinking which is not technocratic has an opportunity for a renaissance in this country.","It's a short step from the belief that every child should be wanted to the belief that a child exists to satisfy our wants.","Limits have to be set on how far one can simply use the... cleverness that we have to make changes.","Many people recognize that technology often comes with unintended and undesirable side effects.","My job is to provide the president with the richest possible consideration, so that he knows what is at stake in whatever decision he makes.","Nobody knew in advance that in vitro fertilization would be, by and large, safe.","Once you put human life in human hands, you have started on a slippery slope that knows no boundaries.","One could look over the past century and ask oneself, has the increased longevity been good, bad or indifferent?","One should proceed with caution. We may simply not be wise enough to do some of the kinds of engineering things that people are talking about doing.","Our only responsibility is to live our own life and take care of our own children.","Perhaps you could sympathize with those who seek to replace a dead child with a copy, or to copy a parent or a relative or even a celebrity.","Sexuality itself means mortality - equally for both man and woman.","The abortion controversy is important for what it says about our stance toward procreation and children altogether.","The human animal has evolved as a preeminently social animal.","The so-called right to reproduce is not an unlimited right.","The technological way of thinking has infected even ethics, which is supposed to be thinking about the good.","There were certain questions about the foundations of morals that advances in science all threaten to make more complicated.","There's an ancient tension between wanting to savor the world as it is and wanting to improve on the world as given.","We are enmeshed in a lineage that came from somewhere and is going to make way for the next generation.","We are somehow natured, not just to reproduce, but for sociality and even for culture.","We know next to nothing of what we're going to know in 20 or 50 years.","We owe our existence to our parents, but we actually didn't have a choice.","We should never rush into folly just because other nations are practicing it.","What does it mean to be an individual? What does it mean to flourish?","We may simply not be wise enough to do some of the kinds of engineering things that people are talking about doing.","In cloning, in contrast, reproduction is asexual - the cloned child is the product not of two but of one.","In the case of abortion, one pits the life of the fetus against the interests of the pregnant woman."],"Leon Krier":["Horizontal and vertical sprawl... are the dinosaurs of an ending fossil-fuel age of synthetic culture.","Surprisingly, the Eisenhower Memorial design contains almost none of the known Gehry-box of tricks. His giant etched chain-link curtain, first applied in 1979 to hide an ungracious parking garage at Santa Monica Place, is resurrected for Eisenhower to screen the equally graceless facade of the Department of Education.","You can't have the finest buildings if they're not in focus. They become like nice cars parked on the street.","If a dictator takes up my ideas, the resulting town will survive the political system that commissioned it and stand as a social good. Besides, modernism rather than classicism has dominated the architecture of totalitarian regimes of both the left and right.","The more you densify a city, the more congestion will increase, however technology changes... cities so packed that they will no longer function... vertical sprawl.","I grew up in a small town that was absolutely a perfect embodiment of new urbanism.","Modernist architecture and town planning is inimical to human beings... based on the Darwinian concept that evolution is open ended, that there must always be something new and better.","The problem was Le Corbusier was a genius and an enormous artist, but he tried to resolve problems to which there is no solution. So the idea to demolish the centre of Paris in order to adapt it to the car - he drew it! - is something not even the most bloody dictators conceived.","The Eisenhower Memorial competition and project have stirred a remarkable polemic, the center of which is not President Eisenhower or Washington, D.C. but Mr. Gehry and the values he promulgates.","Against expectations I was charmed by Gehry's Edgemar development, which housed the Santa Monica Museum of Art, and positively awed by the Bilbao Guggenheim. That Gehry is a great artist I have no doubt, but talent and determination are no warrant against confusion, nor are they a guaranty to produce great art.","Why should the Eisenhower memorial be over twice the size of WWII Memorial? Why should it be so vast as to comfortably house two Lincoln Memorials, two Washington Monuments, and two Jefferson Memorials - all six at once?","As long as artists arbitrarily assume the right to decide what is or is not art, it is logical that the public will just as arbitrarily feel that they have the right to reject it.","As is the case with all good things in life - love, good manners, language, cooking - personal creativity is required only rarely.","Tiredness sets a natural limit to what a human being is prepared to walk daily, and this limit has taught man all through history the size of rural or urban communities.","You need a prince to make a town in an intellectual sense. Developers want to make money. If they cared about architecture, they'd become architects. I've had so many projects that never came off because they had no sponsor, and not because they were utopian. I just want to build a town that's normal.","Lots of English people say exactly the opposite of what they mean.","I don't build because I am an architect. I can make true architecture because I do not build.","A city can only be reconstructed in the form of urban quarters. A large or a small city can only be reorganized as a large or a small number of urban quarters; as a federation of autonomous quarters. Each quarter must have its own center, periphery and limit. Each quarter must be a city within a city."],"Leon Max":["The psychology of fashion is interesting because we're selling people something they don't really need. We're just selling them something that makes them feel good. Besides, there is nothing really new in fashion. Everything worth doing has been done before.","Everything is always grungy in England, no? It's like a little shibboleth of the upper class, wearing something out of your grandfather's trunk.","There's something to be said for a disregard of fashion, but it has to be a carefully curated disregard. It works best, I think, on someone under 18. After the age of, say, 40, you can end up looking like a bag lady.","Kudos to people who put themselves forward as the arbiters of taste.","My wife is always by far the best-dressed person anywhere we go. And remember, we are surrounded by rich people who can afford to buy £20,000 gowns.","I don't have many Russian friends. My childhood friends are dead - either from bad health, or they died in perestroika.","By 25, I was a millionaire.","I really like England. I like the lifestyle and the country. The history. The culture, which London is full of. The country pursuits.","My constant goal is to create clothing that applies to the lifestyle of my customers. My clothing must be aesthetically pleasing in color, texture, and construction. Rapid changes are a part of fashion, and the demands of the industry are that I remain fluid and versatile. But my aesthetic requirements will always be the same.","I use the computer as a paintbrush. It enables me to do in hours what would have taken months.","To me, the fashion and architecture I like are very closely linked. Both should be clean and simple and without embellishment."],"Leon Panetta":["Rising sea levels, severe draughts, the melting of the polar caps, the more frequent and devastating natural disasters all raise demand for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.","The United States was attacked on 9/11/12, and we know who attacked us.","The American Dream has been defended, in every generation, by the brave men and women willing to fight and die for America. They are our greatest national treasure. They deserve a serious Commander-in-Chief.","Go forward, knowing that you are greater than the challenges of your time.","One demonstration of extremists, any more than a Ku Klux Klan demonstration in the United States, is not necessarily reflective of what the rest of the country feels.","An aggressor nation or extremist group could gain control of critical switches and derail passenger trains, or trains loaded with lethal chemicals.","The area of climate change has a dramatic impact on national security.","I think the primary message to the world is that the United States is going to remain the strongest military power in the world.","If the Iraqis fail to implement the reforms, if they fail to get a handle on the violence, there's nothing the United States can do, militarily or otherwise, that can solve those problems. They have to assume the primary responsibility to govern themselves.","The United States, and the president's made this clear, does not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. That's a red line for us. And it's a red line obviously for the Israelis so we share a common goal here.","The last thing I want to do is to make the mistakes of the past.","There's no question that the main location of Al Qaida is in tribal areas of Pakistan.","Winning in Afghanistan is having a country that is stable enough to ensure that there is no safe haven for Al Qaida or for a militant Taliban that welcomes Al Qaida. That's really the measure of success for the United States.","Well look, CIA is an agency that has to collect intelligence, do operations. We have to take risks and it's important that we take risks and that we know that we have the support of the government and we have the support of the American people in what we're doing.","The United States will do whatever we have to do to protect our forces.","You know, as director of the CIA, I got an awful lot of intelligence about all the horrible things that could go on across the world.","I think what both Republicans and Democrats need to do and the leaders on both sides is to recognize that if sequester takes place, it would be disastrous for our national defense and very frankly for a lot of very important domestic programs. They have a responsibility to come together, find the money necessary to de-trigger sequester.","You know, one thing I've learned over 40 years is that when you have jobs in Washington, you do it day by day and that's what I'm doing as secretary of defense.","I don't engage in hypotheticals.","I mean, the Taliban, my view is that they have been weakened. We have not seen them able to conduct any kind of organized attack to regain any territory that they've lost. We've seen levels of violence going down.","Frankly, my fundamental beliefs have not changed.","Throughout the 40 years I've been in Washington, I've always worked hard, particularly with regards to the budget issues.","After every major conflict - World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the fall of the Soviet Union - what happened was that we ultimately hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep across-the-board cuts.","Iran's continued drive to develop nuclear capabilities, including troubling enrichment activities and past work on weaponization documented by the IAEA, and its continued support to groups like Hezbollah, Hamas and other terrorist organizations make clear that the regime in Tehran is a very grave threat to all of us.","Iran is isolating itself from the rest of the world.","Rather than undermining the Palestinian Authority, it is in Israel's interests to strengthen it by... continuing to transfer Palestinian tax revenues and pursuing other avenues of cooperation.","When you're smaller and leaner, you're not going to have that large a presence throughout the world.","Well, the United States is a Pacific power. And we have always had a presence in the Pacific.","When you cut a half-a-trillion dollars from the defense budget, it affects almost every area in the defense budget.","Al Qaeda still remains a threat.","I think soon after I became director of the CIA - President Obama pulled me into the Oval Office and said: 'Look, I just want you to know that your top priority is to go after Osama bin Laden.'","In this century, the 21st century, the U.S. recognizes our prosperity and our security depends even more on the Asia-Pacific region.","Well, you know, any defense force worth its salt has to be able to deal with uncertainty, has to be able to deal with events that we may not have planned for.","China is a major power in the Pacific and I think we are dealing with some common threats in that region: the whole issue of Korea and the stability of Korea, the whole issue of nuclear proliferation, the whole issue of providing free access to our ships that are operating in that area.","We either believe in the dignity of the individual, the rule of law, and the prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment, or we don't. There is no middle ground.","I'm going to give people the benefit of the doubt.","I'm not big on commissions.","I don't think I should penalize people who were doing their duty.","If you're a terrorist, you're a terrorist.","My whole life has been dedicated to public service.","It doesn't make a lot of sense for us to borrow money from the Chinese to go give to another country for humanitarian aid. We ought to get the Chinese to take care of the people.","I suddenly realized at the CIA that I had to make life-and-death decisions about people.","Unfortunately these days, there is a hell of a lot that keeps me awake.","The Taliban is resilient.","Today, I think the attitude is that governing is not necessarily good politics, and the result is that it's much more partisan and much more divided.","I mean, the Taliban, my view is that they have been weakened.","The fundamental premise is that neither the United States or the international community is going to allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.","The United States has to have the capability to deal with more than one enemy at one time and be able to confront them and win.","Red lines are kind of political arguments that are used to try to put people in a corner.","You don't deploy forces into harm's way without knowing what's going on.","I don't think there's any question that America is safer as a result of the bin Laden operation.","These days, it takes only seconds - seconds - for a picture, a photo, to suddenly become an international headline.","The United States is going to defend itself under any circumstances.","Companies should be able to share specific threat information with the government without the prospect of lawsuits hanging over their head.","I know that young people sometimes, caught up in the moment, make some very foolish decisions.","I don't usually comment on columnists' ideas of what I'm thinking. That's a dangerous game to get into.","During my time as CIA Director and Secretary of Defense, Hillary was a strong supporter of our efforts to protect our homeland, decimate al-Qaeda, and bring Osama bin Laden to justice.","She is smart. She is principled. She is tough, and she is ready. Hillary is the single most experienced and prepared person who has ever run for president.","When the president went around the table to the country's national security leadership, Hillary was clear: We have to go get bin Laden. And our Special Operations Forces did just that."],"Leon Redbone":["I've got a very behind-the-scenes personality. I don't know how I became a performer. I like to stay discreet, out of the public eye, very low-key.","I'm sad and blue, about nobody but you. I told you that I loved you right from the start, you told me the same and now you try to break my little heart.","I don't do anything mysterious on purpose. I'm less than forthcoming, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm mysterious. It just means I'm not inclined to go there.","Lonesome. Lonesome. I know what it means. Here all by my lonesome, dreaming empty dreams. Weary. Weary at the close of day, wondering if tomorrow brings me joy or sorrow.","Who told you I was a musician?","I extract what I consider the best material from different sources. But often the material I perform comes from a very strange location in history, which are minstrel shows.","I think of these things as obstacles rather than opportunities, because if they were opportunities it means I actually took the business of doing them seriously. To take myself too seriously is the gentle kiss of death.","What I do and what I record only work for the moment.","It can even be a single note which defines the entire song.","The only thing that interests me is history - reviewing the past and making something out of it.","I think there's a preoccupation with the American market to make excuses and justify its past. If it isn't current, it means somebody has to make an excuse for it. If it's 'cult,' it gives it a sense of illegitimate legitimacy.","If you're not interested in history, if you're living for the day, you need some sort of cliche hook. I certainly don't think of myself as a cult anything. It's a strange thing to even consider pursuing.","I'm not interested in stirring anybody up through music. If you're going to stir people up, it has to be a thought process that has nothing to do with music. I see music as having to do with an internal thing. Something that stirs you up is external.","I don't think music should be played anywhere near politics. The two don't go together.","My views on music, and life in general, are completely out of step with everything that's going on. I've always been out of step. The only thing that interests me is history, reviewing the past and making something out of it.","If I had mastered the Spanish language to any extent, I might have gone in that direction.","I would like to speak 10 languages.","I don't have a home. I'm on the road, more or less.","Other musicians are basically personalities who want to make a name for themselves. All I do is sing old songs in the best way I can. What else is there to know? If you were a blacksmith, what would people need to know about you other than whether you can make a good horseshoe?","I got out of the music industry many years ago. I had a charlatan for a producer who I wanted nothing to do with. He's dead now, so I guess I can't beat that horse any more. It left a very bad taste in my mouth, so I just went on about my business doing what I do and not involving myself with record companies, except for distribution.","I have a visual sense for the music. It has to stay true to a certain sense of period. I rely on a sense of colors and mood in my approach to the arrangement.","I tend to notice work.","Music doesn't really require whether the person's a young person or old person for whatever kind of music it is.","I just do a random roulette wheel version of what I've recorded or sometimes tunes I haven't recorded. It's a collection of whatever happens, happens.","There's a little Christmas in all of us, I guess. Even in me.","Home is where you hang your hat."],"Leon Spinks":["Opportunity knocks only once. You never know if you'll get another opportunity.","I'm happy 'bout life. Still trying. I ain't giving up on life.","I know a lot of people think I'm dumb. Well, at least I ain't no educated fool.","I didn't push Cory. I wanted him to decide if he wanted to go into boxing and he did. Can't blame it on me.","It ain't what you do it's how you do it.","Well, I'm still breathing.","I have no regrets.","Kids always need a role model. I let them know you can do it, too, if you really want to.","I still am champion in my own right.","You do the best you can.","I got hit a lot. I'm glad I lived through it.","If I can give you some kind of knowledge of life you should listen.","God gave me the strength to see, and breathe, and talk.","I never did think I had brain damage.","I don't want the kids to go through want I went through.","I love helping the kids.","You can't do nothing but try if you still got it in your heart.","I'm gonna keep going.","It's still in my heart. I can do it."],"Leon Theremin":["I conceived of an instrument that would create sound without using any mechanical energy, like the conductor of an orchestra. The orchestra plays mechanically, using mechanical energy; the conductor just moves his hands, and his movements have an effect on the music artistry.","There was one man who was interested in the color of music, the connection between light and music, and that was Einstein."],"Leon Trotsky":["Life is not an easy matter... You cannot live through it without falling into frustration and cynicism unless you have before you a great idea which raises you above personal misery, above weakness, above all kinds of perfidy and baseness.","The masses go into a revolution not with a prepared plan of social reconstruction, but with a sharp feeling that they cannot endure the old regime. Only the guiding layers of a class have a political program, and even this still requires the test of events and the approval of the masses.","There are no absolute rules of conduct, either in peace or war. Everything depends on circumstances.","Old age is the most unexpected of all things that happen to a man.","Everyone has the right to be stupid on occasion, but Comrade Macdonald abuses the privilege.","There is a limit to the application of democratic methods. You can inquire of all the passengers as to what type of car they like to ride in, but it is impossible to question them as to whether to apply the brakes when the train is at full speed and accident threatens.","Ideas that enter the mind under fire remain there securely and for ever.","The end may justify the means as long as there is something that justifies the end.","The depth and strength of a human character are defined by its moral reserves. People reveal themselves completely only when they are thrown out of the customary conditions of their life, for only then do they have to fall back on their reserves.","If we had more time for discussion we should probably have made a great many more mistakes.","Where force is necessary, there it must be applied boldly, decisively and completely. But one must know the limitations of force; one must know when to blend force with a maneuver, a blow with an agreement.","The historic ascent of humanity, taken as a whole, may be summarized as a succession of victories of consciousness over blind forces - in nature, in society, in man himself.","Fascism is nothing but capitalist reaction.","In a serious struggle there is no worse cruelty than to be magnanimous at an inopportune time.","You may not be interested in strategy, but strategy is interested in you.","Not believing in force is the same as not believing in gravity.","From being a patriotic myth, the Russian people have become an awful reality.","Revolutions are always verbose.","The dynamic of revolutionary events is directly determined by swift, intense, and passionate changes in the psychology of classes which have already formed themselves before the revolution.","Insurrection is an art, and like all arts has its own laws.","Learning carries within itself certain dangers because out of necessity one has to learn from one's enemies.","Technique is noticed most markedly in the case of those who have not mastered it.","Let a man find himself, in distinction from others, on top of two wheels with a chain - at least in a poor country like Russia - and his vanity begins to swell out like his tires. In America it takes an automobile to produce this effect.","England is nothing but the last ward of the European madhouse, and quite possibly it will prove to be the ward for particularly violent cases.","Events can neither be regarded as a series of adventures nor strung on the thread of a preconceived moral. They must obey their own laws."],"Leon Uris":["I am very proud of this work because it is more about the meaning of the Easter Rising and its relationship to what this whole century has been about, people liberating themselves, freeing themselves.","English of course is your major tool, but it is not nearly so important as other aspects of writing for example you have to have some natural ability you can't buy it no one puts it there you're born with it.","Often we have no time for our friends but all the time in the world for our enemies.","It is extremely important to know what you don't want to find.","Research to me is as important or more important than the writing. It is the foundation upon which the book is built.","I enjoy writing, sometimes; I think that most writers will tell you about the agony of writing more than the joy of writing, but writing is what I was meant to do.","I was too heavy to be a jockey and too honest to be a producer, so I became a writer.","I was a terrible English student.","Usually a good part of the people trying it end up not making it.","So writing is a very, very difficult position to obtain... and retain.","Writing, basically breaks down to relationships between people and that is what you write about.","I do not write for an audience.","I essentially write for myself.","I have been writing for 50 years and readers still read my first book from when I was in the Marine Corps.","You can try to reach an audience, but you just write what comes out of you and you just hope that it is accepted. You do not write specifically to a generation.","I have drawn inspiration from the Marine Corps, the Jewish struggle in Palestine and Israel, and the Irish.","My first book was rejected nine times. It turned out to be a best seller, Battle Cry? in 1953."],"Leon Wieseltier":["There are times when the power of language is not the power that is needed.","Her book about the money in sex gives you the feeling of the sex in money.","Incorruptibility by money is the old story... Now it's incorruptibility by media.","I do not value religion chiefly for its morality.","There are moral religious people and moral secular people, immoral religious people and immoral secular people.","The world invited me many places.","I was not interested in spending 10 years in the culture wars.","What matters to me is that one identifies one's genuine obsessions, one's genuine commitments, one's genuine appetites, one pursues them seriously and far.","Dilettantism is the sort of thing one must avoid."],"Leona Helmsley":["I've always wanted to be the biggest real estate man to come down the pike.","We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes."],"Leona Lewis":["I'm very sensitive and I'm quite a soft person, and I cry a lot when things upset me.","I call myself a vegetarian with vegan tendencies.","A part of me feels like I was an animal in my past life that wasn't treated very nicely.","I'd date someone younger or older; age doesn't matter to me. Or looks, really - it's all about maturity.","If I can inspire people by showing that following a dream by working hard and being determined is possible, it's amazing.","I love a beautiful gown on stage, and luckily I've been fortunate to wear some amazing dresses.","Obviously, a long-distance relationship is hard. But, like anything worth having, you make it work.","It takes bravery to end a relationship.","I'm a positive person, and I try to look at the good side of everything.","Love is a very powerful emotion and when a break-up is unexpected, it's very hard to get over.","Animal testing is needless, especially in cosmetics.","For me, love is happiness and inspiration.","I love nature and enjoy learning new skills.","I'm quite curvy and I just try and exercise whenever I can. I don't do anything hardcore as I'm just not that dedicated.","I don't mind letting people in a little bit, but I have learned from the past not to talk too much about my relationships and to keep things as private as possible.","At the end of the day, you should take every opportunity that comes your way.","I like someone who can take the reins, who knows what they want and is strong with me.","I trust every single person around me, and if I feel even a whiff of uncertainty I won't have that person around me.","I love music but, of course, I'd choose love over that.","I can't remember who told me but I was advised early on not to Google myself or read things about myself... I don't read a lot but get the gist of what's been said from friends and family. It's good to avoid it if you want to be normal person.","I suffer from arachnophobia. I don't mind the tiny spiders so much, it's the ones with their legs covered in thick hair.","I think it's always important to be vigilant of what you're doing and aware of your surroundings.","I would love to sing opera.","I'll never go against my morals.","David Bowie is such a big influence to me. Everything about him as a person is intriguing to me.","I am, and always will be, proud to be a Hackney girl.","I'm really not that confident!","I don't think I have the right to give someone advice when I don't know them.","Sometimes I think I want to get 'hair and make up' every day, but that's just not possible.","It takes me a while to come out of myself and get to know people.","I'm very strong creatively, in my music.","I think when people see that you are shy, or even just calm, collected and reserved, they think you can be pushed around, made to do everything they want - but that's definitely not true of me. The people closest to me know that's not the case. They know I'm not a pushover.","I'm living my dream.","When I was really little I would sit in the back of my dad's car when he'd be playing old-school music. He'd turn down the music and turn around and I'd be singing and know all of the words but I didn't even know how to talk. From then on I've always wanted to be a singer.","The most important thing to me is to give something back to my parents, because they've done so much for me throughout my life.","I'm not a loud, extravagant person; I'm never going to be that and, to be honest, I don't want to be like that.","I don't really read the tabloids, and you never know if what's being printed is true or not.","I was the only one at stage school who wasn't white.","I am definitely an individual.","A lot of people can have a lot of different influences, everyone can be compared in some way to someone whether they are from 60 years ago or more recent.","Every performer wants to sing live. That's what I live for.","I know how to look after myself.","The part of London where I grew up has the highest crime rates in the country.","I'm totally against animal cruelty. I don't have clothes, shoes or bags made from any animal products.","I really love getting hot stone massages. They really help me relax and it's so soothing for your muscles.","I love horseback riding. I still do it.","I love Thandie Newton. I love her fashion sense as she is just really classic.","I do love a bit of fashion. I grew up around a lot of it as my mum and dad had clothing stores so my mum was always designing a lot, and I definitely had that as an influence.","Unless the radio is on, I am usually listening to stuff that is very different to what I do.","Working with other artists and sharing your passions is great.","Music TV in the U.K. is disappearing. 'Top Of The Pops,' 'CD:UK' and shows like that have gone, and it's bringing down the music industry. We should do as much as we can to keep our music TV and producers need to be more willing to accommodate live music.","I think it's really hard being in a boy band. There's a lot of dynamics.","I'm glad I was never in a band.","I never dress to shock.","I want all of my songs to do well whether I've written them or not.","I've still kind of maintained a low profile but people still kind of recognize you and will come up to you, and that's taken a bit of getting used to.","My parents have always done what they've loved, and they've had many different careers.","I'm not annoying in relationships! I'm great!","I could hang with horses all day.","People write music, and the music is out there for people to interpret it how they want to.","I'd love to do a film like 'Chicago.' Something musical because I've obviously come from that background.","I've always been conscious of my weight.","Overall, I'm quite good with how I spend my cashola.","My mum is my best friend.","My dad is such a good man.

I can't tell you the number of times people have put autotune on my voice, and I'm like, 'Please take it off!' You don't even sound human; it makes you sound like a robot!","People don't really know me at all.","Kids need somewhere to go, so they're not bored on the street.","I don't get involved in record label politics.","I am a whole lot of trouble.","I don't have many famous friends, really, except Simon Cowell.","I hate having my hair cut so I try not to.","I get such lovely gifts from fans... amazing pictures, handmade jewellery. I'm very lucky!","I try not to diet because it never really works for me, if I tell myself I can't eat something then I tend to want to eat everything in sight.","I usually dream of melodies. When I wake up I have them in my head. I usually come up with things in the middle of the night because that's when my mind is the quietest. I always have my tape recorder, pen and pad by my bed just in case.","My private life is the most precious thing to me.","I'd love to be on 'Glee.' I'd love to play a rebel.

There's a very beautiful side to it; it's scenic, and I can go horse riding.","I believe I could have had a career in the music industry without 'X Factor,' but it was an amazing platform that propelled me to where I am now.","I don't like going out where it's really, really crowded.","Usually when I see someone famous, for some reason, I think I know them.","All my friends I've known since I was really little.","There are so many songs I've recorded, only to hear other people singing them. It happens all the time.","People will always show their true selves in the end."],"Leonard Alfred George Strong":["Real people are places to me as much as persons: I want to see them, as I want to see the places I am fond of, in all weathers and at all times of the year.","I broke down while at Oxford, was rejected by a record number of medical tribunals during the War, and finally got permission to leave Oxford and do civilian work till the War ended.","People and places are the source of my work, both in prose and verse-and this remark is not the truism it seems, for I do not distinguish as sharply between a place and a person as most people seem to do.","Country people give me more than writers, and country places than towns."],"Leonard Bacon":["Technique! The very word is like a shriek of outraged Art. It is the idiot name given to effort by those who are too weak, too weary, or too dull to play the game.

But I don't think there is an active, ongoing nihilist self-consciousness in the artist.","There is, however, a change going on in the world. There's far more interest in drawing now than there has been in a long, long time. Schools are beginning to teach drawing again in a serious and meaningful way.","The art schools... you get young kids doing the most vile and meaningless crap. I think they believe every bit of it.","Of course, I did lots of what would be called graphic design now, what used to be called commercial art.","It took me fifty years to deal with the Holocaust at all. And I did it in a literary way.","I think the leaders inevitably express the people they are leading.","I think it has other roots, has to do, in part, with a general anxiety in contemporary life... nuclear bombs, inequality of possibility and chance, inequality of goods allotted to us, a kind of general racist, unjust attitude that is pervasive.","I think if you touch ordinary people, they're simply ordinary people, the way they've always been. They work hard, they don't have really as much as they should.","I always felt that I had anxiety of survival in terms of livelihood even when I was making plenty of money.","I always felt I needed to teach to survive.","But I think doctors have always been either honest or dishonest.","Art is man's distinctly human way of fighting death."],"Leonard Bernstein":["To achieve great things, two things are needed; a plan, and not quite enough time.","Music can name the unnameable and communicate the unknowable.","In the olden days, everybody sang. You were expected to sing as well as talk. It was a mark of the cultured man to sing.","The key to the mystery of a great artist is that for reasons unknown, he will give away his energies and his life just to make sure that one note follows another... and leaves us with the feeling that something is right in the world.","This will be our reply to violence: to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before.","Technique is communication: the two words are synonymous in conductors.","I'm not interested in having an orchestra sound like itself. I want it to sound like the composer.","A liberal is a man or a woman or a child who looks forward to a better day, a more tranquil night, and a bright, infinite future."],"Leonard Boswell":["The American Dream is one of success, home ownership, college education for one's children, and have a secure job to provide these and other goals.","The 9/11 Commission recently released their report, citing important changes which need to be made to improve our nation's homeland security. I voiced my disappointment with the House leadership when this report was left until after the August recess for action.","As the third anniversary of the September 11th attacks draws near we must ensure our nation is prepared to handle the continued threat of violence and terrorism on our country.","The March on Washington affirmed our values as a people: equality and opportunity for all. Forty-one years ago, during a time of segregation, these were an ideal.","As a member of Congress, I believe it is the responsibility of those elected to represent the people at every level of government to ensure that our government works to ensure that every person who wants gainful employment has it.","I am committed to ensure that our intelligence community, law enforcement, medical professionals, and military have the information and funding needed to protect the American people from threats at home and abroad.","For the good of our environment, the good of the economy, and the good of the Nation, I strongly urge support of the upper Mississippi locks and dams project.","The American work ethic is something to be admired. Our workforce, regardless of position, works hard to produce the best product and serve customers to the best of their ability.","As the 29th state to join the United States of America, it is our turn to show the nation what represents Iowa. Our commitment to quality education, hard work, and small-town values are all represented in the Iowa quarter.","As the world's sole remaining super power and economic powerhouses, our nation's ability to be at the forefront of innovation and production has enabled unparalleled economic success of our nation's workforce.","Barge traffic on the Mississippi River represents the most efficient, most cost-effective, most environmentally sound means of transporting commodity goods from this region of the country to market.","Each state in the Union is honored in the order of when it ratified the Constitution and became a part of the United States. This September it is Iowa's turn.

Whether you are in the forest land business or just enjoy the shade of a majestic oak gracing your lawn, we all have an interest in this important issue.","The 9/11 Commission strongly recommends that the National Intelligence Director be fully in control of the budget, from developing it to implementing it, to ensuring that the National Intelligence Director has the clout to make decisions.","The March on Washington was a culmination of years of hard work and dedication of many individuals.","The National Intelligence Director needs the authority to do the job we are asking him to do. That means power over the intelligence budget. And to be effective, to be allowed to do his or her job, they must have authority over the budget.","The pride people take in their work transcends to their homes, their education, families and communities.","We must ensure that every worker has healthcare and is able to save for their retirement.

It's a lot easier than civilian life. You kind of feel like you're in a motorcycle gang.","The last refuge of the insomniac is a sense of superiority to the sleeping world.","There is a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in.","Let judges secretly despair of justice: their verdicts will be more acute. Let generals secretly despair of triumph; killing will be defamed. Let priests secretly despair of faith: their compassion will be true.","As I approach the end of my life, I have even less and less interest in examining what have got to be very superficial evaluations or opinions about the significance of one's life or one's work. I was never given to it when I was healthy, and I am less given to it now.","A woman watches her body uneasily, as though it were an unreliable ally in the battle for love.","There's always a group of songs that I'm working at. Some of them are 10 years old, and some of them are just a few weeks old. I'm always trying to adjust these songs to some position where I can bring them to completion.","Poetry is just the evidence of life. If your life is burning well, poetry is just the ash.","When things get really bad, just raise your glass and stamp your feet and do a little jig. That's about all you can do.","I don't really understand that process called reincarnation but if there is such a thing I'd like to come back as my daughter's dog.","One of the reasons I'm on tour is to meet people. I consider it a reconnaissance. You know, I consider myself like in a military operation. I don't feel like a citizen.","My reputation as a ladies' man was a joke. It caused me to laugh bitterly through the 10,000 nights I spent alone.","This is the most challenging activity that humans get into, which is love. You know, where we have the sense that we can't live without love. That life has very little meaning without love.","And I had not much of a voice. I didn't play that great guitar either.","Torah values are the ones that inform my life.","I can make a couple of good sandwiches: tuna salad and chopped egg salad. And Greek bean soup. I was a cook for my old Zen master for many years. So there were two or three dishes that he liked, you know. Teriyaki salmon, a few things.","If I knew where the good songs came from, I'd go there more often.","Most of the time one is discouraged by the work, but now and again by some grace something stands out and invites you to work on it, to elaborate it or animate it in some way. It's a mysterious process.","We're in a world where there's famine and hunger and people are dodging bullets and having their nails pulled out in dungeons so it's very hard for me to place any high value on the work that I do to write a song. Yeah, I work hard but compared to what?","In dreams the truth is learned that all good works are done in the absence of a caress.","Journalists, especially English journalists, were very cruel to me. They said I only knew three chords when I knew five!","There were times that I thought I was good looking.","At a certain point, if you still have your marbles and are not faced with serious financial challenges, you have a chance to put your house in order. It's a cliche, but it's underestimated as an analgesic on all levels. Putting your house in order, if you can do it, is one of the most comforting activities, and the benefits of it are incalculable.","The older I get, the surer I am that I'm not running the show.","I don't consider myself a pessimist. I think of a pessimist as someone who is waiting for it to rain. And I feel soaked to the skin.","My mind was always very cluttered, so I took great pains to simplify my environment, because if my environment were half as cluttered as my mind, I wouldn't be able to make it from room to room.","When you stop thinking about yourself all the time, a certain sense of repose overtakes you.","My two great heroes are W. B. Yeats and Federico García Lorca.","Success is survival.","We're always experiencing joy or sadness. But there are lots of people who've closed down. And there are times in one's life when one has to close down just to regroup.","I speak of a clinical depression that is the background of your entire life, a background of anguish and anxiety, a sense that nothing goes well, that pleasure is unavailable and all your strategies collapse.","The fact that my songs take a long time to write is no guarantee of their excellence.","The basic function of popular music is to create an environment for courting, lovemaking, and doing the dishes. It's useful because it addresses the heart in the midst of all these activities, and it will always be useful in this very important way.","Children show scars like medals. Lovers use them as secrets to reveal. A scar is what happens when the word is made flesh.","I have a deep tribal sense. I grew up in a synagogue that my ancestors built. I sat in the third row. My family was decent. They were good people; they were handshake people. So I never had a sense of rebellion.","I think the term poet is a very exalted term and should be applied to a man at the end of his work. When he looks back over the body of his work and he's written poetry then let the verdict be that he's a poet.","The term clinical depression finds its way into too many conversations these days. One has a sense that a catastrophe has occurred in the psychic landscape.","I had girlfriends who really irritated me by their devotion to the Beatles. I didn't begrudge them their interest, and there were songs like 'Hey Jude' that I could appreciate. But they didn't seem to be essential to the kind of nourishment that I craved.","Women stand for the objective world for a man. They stand for the thing that you're not and that's what you always reach for in a song.","I had the title poet, and maybe I was one for a while. Also, the title singer was kindly accorded me, even though I could barely carry a tune.","We used to play music for fun. Much more than now. Now nobody picks up a guitar unless they're paid for it.","I never really liked poetry readings; I liked to read poetry by myself, but I liked singing, chanting my lyrics to this jazz group.","I've got beautiful reviews for all my books, and I'm very well thought of in the tiny circles that know me, but I'm really starving.","There are writers who are great visionaries, who can depict huge movements - things like that. They're the great writers. I'm just the other kind.","I am an old scholar, better-looking now than when I was young. That's what sitting on your ass does to your face.","Out of the thousands who are known or who want to be known as poets, maybe one or two are genuine and the rest are fakes, hanging around the sacred precincts, trying to look like the real thing.","I can work on a verse for a very long time before realising it's not any good and then, and only then, can I discard it.","I never had the sense that there was an end: that there was a retirement or that there was a jackpot.","You can keep the body as well-oiled and receptive as possible, but whether you're actually going to be able to go for the long haul is really not your own choice.","Prayer is translation. A man translates himself into a child asking for all there is in a language he has barely mastered.","To every people the land is given on condition. Perceived or not, there is a Covenant, beyond the constitution, beyond sovereign guarantee, beyond the nation's sweetest dreams of itself.","Any startling piece of work has a subversive element in it, a delicious element often. Subversion is only disagreeable when it manifests in political or social activity.","I didn't want to write for pay. I wanted to be paid for what I write.","I always considered myself a minor writer. My province is small, and I try to explore it very, very thoroughly.","I read with some amusement my reputation as a ladies' man. My friends are amused by that, too, because they know my life.","My sense of proprietorship has been so weak that actually I didn't pay attention and I lost the copyrights on a lot of the songs.","Well, for one thing, in the tradition of Zen that I've practiced, there is no prayerful worship and there is no affirmation of a deity.","I always thought that poetry is the verdict that others give to a certain kind of writing. So to call yourself a poet is a kind of dangerous description. It's for others; it's for others to use.","And most people have a woman in their heart, most men have a woman in their heart and most women have a man in their heart.","I don't think you can write novels on the road. You need a certain stability.","I was 15 when I first became deeply touched by the rhythm and structure of words.","As a young man, Yeats spoke to me in a way I could understand. Shakespeare I couldn't understand, but Yeats I could. It was his subject matter and also I really admired the way he put his personal life on the line.","I always felt I was scraping the bottom of the barrel trying to get a song together.","I've always been into self-dramatization. I intend to live forever.","As we make our way toward the finish line that some of us have already crossed, I never thought I'd get a Grammy Award. In fact, I was always touched by the modesty of their interest.","I had a very messianic childhood.","I think that Bob Dylan knows this more than all of us: you don't write the songs anyhow. So if you're lucky, you can keep the vehicle healthy and responsive over the years. If you're lucky, your own intentions have very little to do with this.","I've never sold widely enough to be able to relax about money. I had two kids and their mother to support and my own life. So there was never an option of cutting out.","All of my writing has guitars behind it, even the novels.","I was born in a suit.","I never had huge amounts of money when I was young. I had huge amounts of fame, and I always had the sense of labor and recompense. I always said I don't want to work for pay, but I want to get paid for my song.","Some people care about their work lasting forever - I have little interest in it.","Songs seem to take me a long time. I don't know why; they're not especially excellent for taking so long.","I don't have any sense or urgency about any of my writing, actually. I don't think mankind will be damaged if I don't put out a new album or a new book.","There are some people who come to me for some illumination on their problems. I guess they feel I'm writing about some of the things they themselves are going through. But I don't usually have much help to give - there isn't much you can say to someone in the midst of their own crises."],"Leonard Lance":["The bailout of Fannie Mae is completely off the books. It's going to cost us hundreds of billions of dollars. Yet nobody is placing this in any type of column in accounting for federal debt.","Sometimes, people forget my record of fiscal conservatism on major issues in the state legislature. The greatest example is my voting against the pension borrowing scheme in 1997.","I've always tried to vote my conscience.","The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news.","I think people are sick and tired of bailouts, domestically and internationally."],"Leonard Lauder":["When you live in the shadow of a big tree, you have to run twice as fast to get into the sunlight.","I'm not a builder of buildings, I'm a builder of collections.","A visionary is someone who can see the future, or thinks he sees the future. In my case, I use it and it comes out right. That doesn't come from daydreams or dreams, but it comes from knowing the market and knowing the world and knowing people really well and knowing where they're going to be tomorrow.","I love that works of art are printed so that anyone can buy them. The variety of what they put on little postcards astounds me.","Power is winning the battle over who owns the customer: the brand or the retailer.","You can't separate a house from a family. It's a living, breathing home.","You are only as successful as the people who work for you want you to be.","I love rumors. It gives me something to think about and enjoy.","To be a great leader, you firstly have to like people. If you don't like people, at the end of the day they will figure this out and you can't lead them too well.","If I don't learn something every single day, it's a wasted day.","Every morning, I eat one fat-free yogurt with a sliced peach when peaches are in season, and one thin slice of whole-wheat bread. The same thing. I don't want to get fat. And I want to keep my fitness.","I don't think there's anything wrong with being paternalistic as a company.","I happen to like Precisionism. It talks to me because I collect Cubism.","I think a cosmetics company should be headed by a woman.","No one stopped buying I.B.M. because Tom Watson wasn't there, but they stopped buying Elizabeth Arden because she wasn't there.","My mother always used to say when picking up a product, 'Would you give this to the Duchess of Windsor?' Well, that's lovely. But the Duchess of Windsor is dead.","If tomorrow all of America were to become paternalistic, we would beat the Japanese every day of the week. I think that the concept of accusing someone of running a paternalistic company, that's not an accusation. One should compliment someone on that.","The best advice I ever got came from my mother, Estee Lauder: She believed that if you had something good to say, you should put it in writing. But if you had something bad to say, you should tell the person to his or her face.","One person really can make a difference.","I'd rather be a big fish in a specialized pond than a little, little fish in a more generalized big pond."],"Leonard Little":["Not a problem kid or anything like that so when you're in the legal system like that, it's always hard on a person for the first time to go through some things like that.","St. Louis is more humid. But after a while, the heat started taking a toll on us, so we started rotating a little more up front trying to stay fresh out here.","I know who I am and can deal with the use of Indian mascots... But I know it can be demeaning to a group of people. Maybe it would be all right if they were truly honoring the people and are giving due respect to the people they are representing.","This will be my last contract. I wanted it to be a good one.","Some people meet me sometimes and they sit down and talk to me for a while and ask me my name and say, 'Oh, you're the guy'."],"Leonard Maltin":["Everyone is looking for the sure thing. They are looking to hedge their bet. They think the way to do that is to go with a proven quantity, a remake of something you have already seen. That is their mindset.","Dumbo... makes me cry. Every single time and in the exact same spot. I just have a special affection for Dumbo.","The last person to stand still and repeat himself was Walt Disney. He refused to repeat himself. So to think that he'd be making the same kind of film in the year 2001 that he made in 1941 is absurd.","Shakespeare wrote great plays that we're still watching all these years later. Charlie Chaplin made great comedies and they are still as funny today as they ever were.","Quality survives.","While it was occasionally done here or there, nobody else had a figurehead like Walt doing it. Jack Warner wasn't on TV. Walt was the boss, but he had a real public profile and he used it to his advantage. And he became a household face.","Timing in life is everything.","Hollywood executives believe that money is both the be-all and end-all to the moviemaking process.","Los Angeles has the greatest concentration of surviving movie palaces in the United States, yet most residents have never been inside one of them.","NBC anchor Brian Williams is a standup comic in disguise.","I had the great good fortune to interview Peggy Lee. Her memories of working with Walt Disney and his team were warm and upbeat.","I think the people who are making Christmas-themed movies today feel that people are more cynical about Christmas. There's more of an edge.","When Tim Allen made The Santa Clause, I thought that was a delightful film. It took a modern sensibility but layered onto it a kind of sentiment.","I think people in Hollywood are afraid of sentiment because they think audiences will reject it.","Television is what made It's a Wonderful Life the classic it is today.","A Christmas Carol is such a fool-proof story you can't louse it up.","Movie theaters still exist in spite of all of the alternatives that are available, video and video-on-demand and DVD and streaming video and all of these things.","Beauty and the Beast became the first animated feature ever nominated for best picture.","Polar Express is not an attempt to do animation. It is a technology-based film.","I'm a lifelong Disney nut.","Audiences deserve better.","I teach at USC. I have a big class of 360 kids, only about a fifth of whom are film majors. I don't just show the Hollywood blockbusters. I show independent films, foreign films, documentaries.","If I were less than honest as a critic, I think people would spot that right away, and it would destroy my credibility."],"Leonard Mlodinow":["Our subliminal mental processes operate outside awareness because they arise in these portions of our mind that are inaccessible to our conscious self; their inaccessibility is due to the architecture of the brain rather than because they have been subject to Freudian motivational forces like repression.","Expressive speech, with modulation in pitch and volume, and a minimum of noticeable pauses, boosts credibility and enhances the impression of intelligence.","Social rejection doesn't just cause emotional pain; it affects our physical being.","Nonverbal communication forms a social language that is in many ways richer and more fundamental than our words.","On the unconscious level, touch seems to impart a subliminal sense of caring and connection.","In physics, all can you do is predict the consequences of physical laws.","When judging a product, we rarely have exhaustive scientific data to go by. As a result, if we are to form a complete picture, we must fill in the blanks, just as we must in our visual perception.","Social connection is such a basic feature of human experience that when we are deprived of it, we suffer.","People intuitively realize that there is strength in numbers and take comfort in the company of others, especially in times of anxiety or need.","One of the ways we interact with other human beings and form social bonds is through touch, and probably most of us are not aware of the extreme importance of touch.","We all know that looks matter. What most of us don't understand is just how much looks matter and how difficult it is for us to ignore a person's appearance when making a social judgment.","We unwittingly judge products by their boxes, books by their covers, and even corporation's annual reports by their nice glossy finish.","Whether it's fiction or nonfiction, writing takes me to another world.","'Subliminal' is about how we misinterpret our behavior because we're unaware of what our unconscious minds are doing.","Language is handy, but we humans have social and emotional connections that transcend words and are communicated - and understood - without conscious thought.","I believe there is true expertise in some endeavors, and not in others. There is obviously no such thing as expertise in predicting the results of coin tosses, but there is expertise in predicting the behavior of lasers.","A failure doesn't mean you are unworthy, nor does it preclude success on the next try.","I believe in a kind of God. I think all scientists, in a way, believe in a certain God, in a certain order of nature.","Evolution is among the most well-established theories in the scientific community. To doubt it sounds to biologists as absurd as denying relativity does to physicists.","Politicians often misuse science for political ends and to pursue their own agenda.","The attacks on global warming are no different than the attacks the cigarettes companies used to use to say that cigarettes don't cause cancer.","We all know that looks matter, and modern politicians have always assumed that their battles are decided on both substance and image.","Intentionality and talent always matter. An extraordinary feat is certainly made more likely by someone's focus, hard work, etc. But chance also matters.","I think the fun of following the movie box office and stocks is very similar to the fun of sports - all three combine passion and unpredictability.","I've always loved science, as far back as I can remember. I was very, very curious about how everything worked: the world, the physical universe, chemistry, law. So it was only natural to be curious about how our mind works.","One thing that feeds into the way you experience the social world is your mood - and one thing that affects your mood is the weather.","Non-human primates spend hours a day grooming each other. And with humans, touching is also important. It's a way to form bonds and connect in modern society. But you can also speed up the use of conscious purposes once you're aware of that, and it can be manipulated.","I always liked movies, so I started writing for Hollywood, but my day job was physics.","I find that predicting the course of our lives is like predicting the weather. You might be able to predict your future in the short term, but the longer you look ahead, the less likely you are to be correct.","We should keep in mind that it is easy to concoct stories explaining the past or to become confident about dubious scenarios of the future. We should view both explanations and prophecies with skepticism.","Of course our feelings matter. But emotional decisions are usually not the best ones. On the other hand, your emotions can affect your decisions whether you like it or not because the effects can occur on the unconscious level.","We all know that players will hit a few more home runs than usual in some years and a few less in others. But the mathematics of chance also predicts that some years they'll hit a lot more, and some years a lot less.","By subliminal, I mean things that occur in our world that are below the threshold of consciousness but do have a psychological effect on us.","We have emotions for a reason; for instance, imagine pain. You have pain so that if you touch something that's hot, or if you slam your hand with a hammer, you will pull your hand away and not do that again.","One of the things your unconscious mind does for you - and it's a great gift - is it gives you extra courage to view the outer world and it does that by giving you an extra-special view of yourself.","In all our perceptions, from vision to hearing, to the pictures we build of people's character, our unconscious mind starts from whatever objective data is available to us - usually spotty - and helps to shape and construct the more complete picture we consciously perceive.","Scientists attach great importance to the human capacity for spoken language. But we also have a parallel track of nonverbal communication, which may reveal more than our carefully chosen words, and sometimes be at odds with them.","We routinely participate in elaborate nonverbal exchanges even when we are not consciously aware of doing so.","One of the most surprising forms of nonverbal communication is the way we automatically adjust the amount of time we spend looking into another's eyes as a function of our relative social position.","People spend a lot of time talking and thinking about how members of the opposite sex look, but very little time paying attention to how they sound. To our unconscious minds, however, voice is very important.","The pitch, timbre, volume, speed, and cadence of your voice, the speed with which you speak, and even the way you modulate pitch and loudness, are all hugely influential factors in how convincing you are and how people judge your state of mind and character.","Listeners instinctively detect that when we lower the usual pitch of our voice, we are sad, and when we raise it, we are angry or fearful.","French culture is known for many great attributes, some of which probably have nothing to do with food, wine, and romance.","Touch seems to be such an important tool for enhancing social cooperation and affiliation that we have evolved a special physical route along which those subliminal feelings of social connection travel from skin to brain.","Touch is our most highly developed sense when we are born, and it remains a fundamental mode of communication throughout a baby's first year and an important influence throughout a person's life.","If memories were indeed like what a camera records, they could be forgotten, or they could fade so that they are no longer clear and vivid. But it would be difficult to explain how people could have memories that are both clear and vivid while also being wrong. Yet that happens, and it is not infrequent.","Just as our brains fill in the details of an image our eyes record only roughly, so, too, do our brains employ tricks we are unaware of to fill in details about people we don't know intimately.","Every aspect of our lives plays out in two versions: one conscious, which we are constantly aware of, and the other unconscious, which remains hidden from us.","We perceive, we remember our experiences, we make judgments, we act - and in all of these endeavors, we are influenced by factors that we aren't aware of.","The truth is that our unconscious minds are active, purposeful, and independent. Hidden they may be, but their effects are anything but, for they play a critical role in shaping the way our conscious minds experience and respond to the world.","My best subjects were chemistry and math.","I just really loved films and thought I should be writing screenplays.","Whatever I've worked on, I've always tried to make my writing personal. I think that's what makes my books somewhat different from what other scientists are doing. You have to tie concepts into everyday life, or they just won't be interesting for readers.","You have to have passion for a subject to write about it. You can't expect your readers to feel any excitement if it's nothing but a boring writing exercise for you."],"Leonard N. Stern":["If I have taught my sons anything in life, it is to have integrity - to always tell the truth, and I believe they have.","I brought my sons into the business to extend my working life, so I could keep my hand in the business."],"Leonard Nimoy":["I think it's my adventure, my trip, my journey, and I guess my attitude is, let the chips fall where they may.","Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.","Which is probably the reason why I work exclusively in black and white... to highlight that contrast.","That is the exploration that awaits you! Not mapping stars and studying nebula, but charting the unknown possibilities of existence.","I'm touched by the idea that when we do things that are useful and helpful - collecting these shards of spirituality - that we may be helping to bring about a healing.","But if you're talking about fine art work, then I think you have to ask yourself some pretty deep questions about why it is you want to take pictures and what it is you want to say.","Some words having to do with the death of the people in the World Trade Center attack had been added, and when I got to it, I had this overwhelmingly emotional experience. I struggled to get through the words; tears were streaming down my cheeks.","I certainly don't live in a kosher home although I was raised in a kosher environment.","The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have.","My folks came to U.S. as immigrants, aliens, and became citizens. I was born in Boston, a citizen, went to Hollywood and became an alien.","Spock is definitely one of my best friends. When I put on those ears, it's not like just another day. When I become Spock, that day becomes something special.","For me it's all about personal vision; is there something about a subject that uniquely speaks to me.","My wife and I are affiliated with a temple here in Los Angeles. We feel very close to the congregation and to the rabbi, who happens to be my wife's cousin and who I admire greatly. I talk to him regularly but I consider myself more spiritual than religious.","I began working with a family camera. It was called a Kodak Autographic, which was one of those things where you flopped it open and pulled out the bellows. And I've been at it ever since; I've never stopped.","I think about myself as like an ocean liner that's been going full speed for a long distance, and the captain pulls the throttle back all the way to 'stop,' but the ship doesn't stop immediately, does it? It has its own momentum and it keeps on going, and I'm very flattered that people are still finding me useful.","Most of my images have been done in-studio, under very controlled lighting conditions. There have been a few that have been shot in nature, but even then they were shot almost exclusively at night, and again, under controlled lighting conditions.","I'm attracted to images that come from a personal exploration of a subject matter. When they have a personal stamp to them, then I think it becomes identifiable.","I use a computer. I don't know if that qualifies me as a techie, but I'm pretty good on the computer.","I have a master's degree in photography as a fine art, and I would call my work primarily conceptual. I don't carry cameras with me wherever I go. I get an idea of a subject matter I want to deal with and I pull out my cameras.","Boston was a great city to grow up in, and it probably still is. We were surrounded by two very important elements: academia and the arts. I was surrounded by theater, music, dance, museums. And I learned how to sail on the Charles River. So I had a great childhood in Boston. It was wonderful.","What I'm exploring right now is the subject of my own mortality. It's an area that I'm curious about, and I'm researching it to see if there's a photographic essay in it for me. If images don't start to come, I'll go to something else.","My dream concept is that I have a camera and I am trying to photograph what is essentially invisible. And every once in a while I get a glimpse of her and I grab that picture.","I did not move into developing or processing color. I stayed with black and white. I still think to this day that I prefer to work in black and white if it has to do with poetry or anything other than specific reality. I have worked in color when I thought it was the appropriate way to express the thought that I was working on.","You know, for a long time I have been of the opinion that artists don't necessarily know what they're doing. You don't necessarily know what kind of universal concept you're tapping into.","You proceed from a false assumption: I have no ego to bruise.","I am not Spock.","Years ago - in the 70s, for about a decade - I carried a camera every place I went. And I shot a lot of pictures that were still life and landscape, using available light.","This time, there have been a lot of interesting discussion about the subject matter and I've had a good time talking about it. And in some of the cases, I'm not just signing books; I'm showing slides and talking about the work.","The book tour has been really interesting and very gratifying. I have not book toured before. I've never had quite as much pleasure, as much satisfaction.","That's true, because I'm a photographer now.","That's the most difficult issue for me... to find a subject that holds my interest long enough that I'm prepared to go to work and spend the time and energy to shoot the subject.","Other times, you're doing some piece of work and suddenly you get feedback that tells you that you have touched something that is very alive in the cosmos.","My memory of those places is better than my pictures. That's why I get much more satisfaction out of shooting thematic work that has to do with an idea that I'm searching for, or searching to express.","I've been working with photography for many years.","I deal with this spiritual issue every day - either shooting or processing or sorting or discussing or having conversations - I'm in constant contact with it.","I became involved in photography when I was about thirteen years old.","I became hooked on the idea of being able to shoot an image and process it myself, and end up with a product.","I also do my own processing, so it means a big commitment in lab time.","A neighborhood friend showed me how it was possible to go to a camera shop and pick up chemicals for pennies... literally... and develop your own film and make prints.","For a period of time, I carried cameras with me wherever I went, and then I realized that my interest in photography was turning toward the conceptual. So I wasn't carrying around cameras shooting stuff, I was developing concepts about what I wanted to shoot. And then I'd get the camera angle and do the job.","I'm not an equipment nut. I tend to use whatever's to hand. I have several cameras, of course, but I'm not emotional about any of them.","I became enamored with photography when I was about 13 or 14 years old. I've been at it ever since. I studied seriously in the '70s."],"Leonard Orr":["I noticed every time I spent a lot of time in the bathtub, I would just get fantastic realizations about myself, and they were so valuable and liberating.","Personal law is simply the thought that controls your mind and your life more than any other thought. Finding that thought is the most valuable knowledge that you can have about yourself. It is like the leverage on personal change. It enables you to change very efficiently.","During one of my early seminars, there were a bunch of seminar junkies there.","It takes as much imagination to create debt as to create income.","Birth is the scariest event of most peoples' lives. You have to feel safe enough in your own mind before you can remember your own birth.","I was endorsed by many corporations to work with their people. Since I had several hundred successful case histories, I realized that it was really valuable and everybody should have access to the information, so I started teaching seminars to groups of people.","The water was like a physiological stimuli to the subconscious that overwhelmed people with too much psychoanalytical material, you might say. People could do 10 breathing sessions without the water, and then they did breathing sessions in the water.","The average session takes about one to two hours. It's totally amazing because when a person breathes, they go through one stage of relaxation after another, and every stage releases tension.","I just refer to myself as being Spirit, Mind and Body like everybody else and working toward the mastery of my natural divinity and the healing of my emotional mind.","The more riches you have, the more you can share. So I like to share everything that I have that's of value.","I have this problem in the rebirthing community because it's so powerful sometimes, I get thrown out because people want to do things a certain way and they are just not open to new ideas, so they don't want me to come around."],"Leonard Peikoff":["Each man must reach his own verdict, by weighing all the relevant evidence.","The more you learn, if you learn it properly, the more clear you become and the more you know.","The unphilosophical majority among men are the ones most helplessly dependent on their era's dominant ideas."],"Leonard Peltier":["A political prisoner is someone who is out fighting for his or her people's rights and freedom and is imprisoned for that alone.","In them days, it was just still not illegal to kill an Indian. If you killed an Indian, you'd be very unfortunate if you got probation - most of them were released immediately.","They still don't want to admit to the world that this isn't the best and the fairest and most equal justice system. And that they are guilty of railroading people into jail. They don't want to, or never will, admit these things.","The United States government can indict you on something, and now you've got to prove your innocence. And that's not the Constitution of the United States.","The FBI has always supported big business and big government.","What Bill Clinton did to us was cruel. The White House gave my attorneys indications that there was a good chance for my clemency to be granted. I had to prepare myself for being released because there was no sign that my petition would be denied."],"Leonard Shlain":["Surgeons are not technicians; they're not mechanics. They're artists. I see patterns where not many other people see patterns. ...I think that's what made me a good surgeon, and now, that's what's making me a good writer.","I'm a synthesizer. We need to synthesize more the relationships between artists and scientists, and men and women.","I... had my mind blown by all the opportunities that were in California in the '60s and '70s. In Detroit, everything was Freud... Out here, everything was Jung."],"Leonard Slatkin":["The convergence of the Rhone and Saone. Paul Bocuse. The birthplace of cinema. Chateauneuf-du-Pape just a few miles down the road. It does not get much better than Lyon.","How could a New Yorker possibly take something called the Hollywood String Quartet seriously?","The role of an orchestra in the 21st century isn't just playing, it's about developing future audiences and performers.","I use my hands like a sculptor, to mold and shape the sound I want, to clarify.","I knew I could never match my father as a violinist, and there were already four generations of outstanding cellists in the family.","On the corner of 57th and 7th Avenue sits the most famous concert hall in the world. No less a figure than when Tchaikovsky led the first performances in 1891. Virtually every major artist has performed there. There is simply no place like it. The first time I stepped foot in Carnegie Hall was in 1964.","Over the years it has been my privilege to lead performances with Saint Louis, the National Symphony, Cleveland Orchestra and so many other wonderful organizations.","There is no 'perfect' in music. If I ever came off the stage and felt it could not be better, it would then be time to quit.","I don't really think about retiring. I will retire just before people start saying, 'I knew Leonard Slatkin when he conducted well.'","An orchestra knows during the first two minutes of the first rehearsal whether or not they are going to enjoy the person on the podium.","A music director cannot and should not be chosen on the basis of a first date. It is not so difficult to make a good impression with a single appearance, usually containing some of a conductor's party pieces, works they have performed successfully many times before.","The conductor is the artistic leader and sometimes cultural arbiter of his or her community. It is their leadership that is looked to and should anything go wrong, they are the persons taking most of the heat.","We are a global society, and one does not have to be from Germany to give a great performance of Beethoven.","I've come to the conclusion that a long, personal relationship is next to impossible for me. Ultimately, music is a possessive mistress.","I'll know I'm reaching the total American market when I'm asked to do a video for MTV.","The life of any musician really doesn't fall into a normal schedule at all. Every week there are different rehearsals, different days and nights of performances, so we don't have a particular pattern that we can follow. For a conductor, it is a little bit worse because we have to allow for traveling.","Growing up in Hollywood, like I did, I have a passion and a love for the movies, so I go to the cinema all the time.","People know Detroit for the cars, but the suburban areas of the city are really beautiful. It's much more inhabitable than people think. Many believe it's like Berlin at the end of World War II.","I am usually cooking at least four times a week if I am home. The easiest thing that I do a lot is gazpacho. It's simple and it tastes best if you let it sit over night in the refrigerator... I don't want anybody near me when I am cooking. If I am going to make a mistake, it has to be my fault.","To my mind and ear, there is simply nothing that compares to the musical sophistication of a late Beethoven, Bartok, Schubert or Brahms work for minimal forces.","I'm not particularly lucid after a concert. I'm not very lucid before, either.","There's not an orchestra in the world that doesn't have weaknesses. None of us can play everything well. The repertoire is just too big.","I'm beginning to see that just knowing the piece is not enough. Having a clear technique is not enough. Having a broad repertory is not enough. I want desperately to get past all those things.","I have been long associated with British music. I have favoured it as my alternate music next to American.","In some ways I believe music is the more convincing communicator of ideas than words. For instance, we can hear of Kordaly and Bartok and recognise them as Hungarian, but very few of us speak Hungarian, but the music itself speaks to more people.","Randy Newman and I grew up together in Los Angeles. We are both products of the film studio era. Randy is one of the great songwriters of our time and one of the fun people to be with."],"Leonard Susskind":["Extra dimensional theories are sometimes considered science fiction with equations. I think that's a wrong attitude. I think extra dimensions are with us, they are with us to stay, and they entered physics a long time ago. They are not going to go away.","Einstein, in the special theory of relativity, proved that different observers, in different states of motion, see different realities.","The success of ordinary cosmology speaks against the idea that the universe was created in a random fluctuation.","I did not come from an academic background. My father was a smart man, but he had a fifth-grade education. He and all his friends were plumbers. They were all born around 1905 in great poverty in New York City and had to go to work when they were 12 or 13 years old.","A lot of my research time is spent daydreaming - telling an imaginary admiring audience of laymen how to understand some difficult scientific idea.","I often feel a discomfort, a kind of embarrassment, when I explain elementary-particle physics to laypeople. It all seems so arbitrary - the ridiculous collection of fundamental particles, the lack of pattern to their masses.","Unforeseen surprises are the rule in science, not the exception. Remember: Stuff happens.","You are a victim of your own neural architecture which doesn't permit you to imagine anything outside of three dimensions. Even two dimensions. People know they can't visualise four or five dimensions, but they think they can close their eyes and see two dimensions. But they can't.","It seems hopelessly improbable that any particular rules accidentally led to the miracle of intelligent life. Nevertheless, this is exactly what most physicists have believed: intelligent life is a purely serendipitous consequence of physical principles that have nothing to do with our own existence.","Science blogs bore me. When everyone is an expert, no one is an expert.","I have a funny mental framework when I do physics. I create an imaginary audience in my head to explain things to - it is part of the way I think. For me, teaching and explaining, even to my imaginary audience, is part of the process.","Life is fragile: it thrives only in a narrow range of temperatures between freezing and boiling. How lucky that our planet is just the right distance from the sun: a little farther, and the death of the perpetual Antarctic winter - or worse - would prevail; a little closer, and the surface would truly fry anything that touched it.","Man - life in general - seems irrelevant to the workings of the universe: a mere smudge of water, grease, and carbon on a pinpoint planet circling a star of no special consequence.","Every time a bit of information is erased, we know it doesn't disappear. It goes out into the environment. It may be horribly scrambled and confused, but it never really gets lost. It's just converted into a different form.","I was from a poor Jewish family in the South Bronx. My father was a plumber, but when I was 16, he got sick and I had to take over. Being a plumber in the South Bronx wasn't fun.","I was going to engineering school but fell in love with physics.","I have always enjoyed explaining physics. In fact it's more than just enjoyment: I need to explain physics.","I'm afraid I am a bit of a technophobe - a nineteenth-century man caught in the twenty-first century. But there is one piece of technology that I would especially welcome: a device to automatically balance restaurant tables on all four legs so that they don't rock back and forth.","You have to say now that space is something. Space can vibrate, space can fluctuate, space can be quantum mechanical, but what the devil is it?","Why is there space rather than no space? Why is space three-dimensional? Why is space big? We have a lot of room to move around in. How come it's not tiny? We have no consensus about these things. We're still exploring them.","Over the years, I began to understand that there were a lot of people out there reading physics in popular literature that they could not understand - not because it was too advanced, but because it wasn't advanced enough.","I'm a great believer that scientists should spend as much time as possible explaining, and you do explain in the process of teaching.","I'm a great believer in our ability to come up with the ideas necessary to solve the big questions. I have less confidence that we'll be able to find a consensus about which ones are right without experiment.","I went to college because my father thought that I should learn engineering, because he wanted to go into the heating business with me. There, I realized I wanted to be a physicist. I had to tell him, which was a somewhat traumatic experience.","Physics is perceived as a lonesome, nerdy kind of enterprise that has very little to do with human feelings and the things that excite people day-to-day about each other. Yet physicists in their own working environment are very social creatures.","I'm doing physics because I'm curious about how it works - full speed ahead, damn the torpedoes, don't worry about whether somebody is going to be able to do an experiment next week, just figure it out.","Space can vibrate, space can fluctuate, space can be quantum mechanical, but what the devil is it? And, you know, everybody has their own idea about what it is, but there's no coherent final consensus on why there is space.","Is the universe 'elegant,' as Brian Greene tells us? Not as far as I can tell, not the usual laws of particle physics, anyway. I think I might find the universal principles of String Theory most elegant - if I only knew what they were.","Whether or not evolution is compatible with faith, science and religion represent two extremely different worldviews, which, if they coexist at all, do so most uncomfortably.","The most important single thing about string theory is that it's a highly mathematical theory, and the mathematics holds together in a very tight and consistent way. It contains in its basic structure both quantum mechanics and the theory of gravity. That's big news.","The dark energy is not exactly zero, but the first 122 decimal points are zero. That's crazy. That is really one of the craziest things we've ever discovered.","I'm not going to argue with people about the existence of God. I have not the vaguest idea of whether the universe was created by an intelligence.","Science to me is sufficiently weird and interesting, and stranger than fiction.","At 5 years old, I saw 'Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,' and I was so scared when Costello sat himself down in the lap of the monster, not realizing where he was. My friends teased me. They were older, 8 years old. And my goal was to become a mad scientist and get back at them. And here I am, mad as hell!","Eventually, when the universe expands enough, all that will be left is the dark energy.","The word 'universe' is obviously not intended to have a plural, but science has evolved in such a way that we need a plural noun for something similar to what we ordinarily call our universe."],"Leonard Woodcock":["Well, first of all the Dominion Bureau of Statistics made a survey in the spring of 1970, which showed that on balance the difference in the cost of living between Canadian cities and American cities was 5 % to the advantage, of course, to the Canadian cities.","And so we said to General Motors that the solution had to be a first year increase, which had to be sizeable because we had to catch up with the lost position as against the cost of living and we had to make some progress.","At the end of 1964, wholesale prices had been relatively stable for some years.","I might say that when the settlement was made the Nixon administration issued what they called a second inflation alert in which the General Motors settlement was branded as being inflationary and bad for the country.","Now, wages in the automobile industry are made up of two components, what we call base rates and the cost of living factor which is fed in by the operation of the escalator.","We made a demand for the the same wage rates to be paid in the Canadian plants as in the U.S. plants.","When we came then to the 1967 negotiations we had the problem of one market between two countries fully under the control of the American companies that owned the facilities on both sides of the border."],"Leonard Woolf":["Anyone can be a barbarian; it requires a terrible effort to remain a civilized man.","The grinding of the intellect is for most people as painful as a dentist's drill."],"Leonardo Del Vecchio":["I don't like paying taxes, but I like sleeping at night.","The values of life are most important.","I am proof that you can you make money in Italy and be honest."],"Leonardo DiCaprio":["I'm not the kind of person who tries to be cool or trendy, I'm definitely an individual.","Everywhere I go, somebody is staring at me, I don't know if people are staring because they recognize me or because they think I'm a weirdo.","My mother is a walking miracle.","If you have the ability to convince somebody of something that you don't necessarily think is the case, it's a valuable asset. Not that I'm, like, a pathological liar, but we spend most of the day not fully being honest, you know?","Raising awareness on the most pressing environmental issues of our time is more important than ever.","If you can do what you do best and be happy, you're further along in life than most people.","I got attention by being funny at school, pretending to be retarded, and jumping around with a deformed hand.","I've been very lucky to have achieved a lot of the things that I dreamt of achieving as a young man. But, at the end of the day - and I truly believe this - it is not about achieving great wealth or success. Because they don't bring happiness, ultimately.","To believe in love, to be ready to give up anything for it, to be willing to risk your life for it, is the ultimate tragedy.","The first kiss I had was the most disgusting thing in my life. The girl injected about a pound of saliva into my mouth, and when I walked away I had to spit it all out.","I prefer ordinary girls - you know, college students, waitresses, that sort of thing. Most of the girls I go out with are just good friends. Just because I go out to the cinema with a girl, it doesn't mean we are dating.","I don't think anyone really gets used to being recognized around the world. It kind of feels like a videogame at times, especially with paparazzi and people following you and things of that nature. But it's part of who I am now.","As a young boy, I was obsessed with endangered species and the extinct species that men killed off. Biology was the subject in school that I was incredibly passionate about.","Drugs? Every one has a choice and I choose not to do drugs.","My mom, Irmelin, taught me the value of life. Her own life was saved by my grandmother during World War II.","I get unhappy doing things that I'm not passionate about. Because I feel like I'm squandering this incredible gift I've been given to finance films. As soon as my name alone was enough to make this happen, I vowed to myself that I was going to work with directors who were changing cinema, doing something important, you know?","My dad's probably one of the kindest people in the world. When I was younger that's not how I was- I was a little spoiled brat.","I love being immersed in nature, going to places in the world that are pristine and untouched by man. It's almost a religious experience when you go to a place like the Amazon, and there's no civilisation for thousands of miles.","My career should adapt to me. Fame is like a VIP pass wherever you want to go.","I've never tried to reach a certain demographic of an audience or try to say, 'OK, now I'm going to do this type of film to transition myself into more adult roles.' Or a romantic hero. Or whatever it may be - you know what I mean?","If I want to go to a party with a few male friends, it doesn't mean I'm gay.","I love science fiction, but I have a hard time feeling for characters in a galaxy far away. Choosing movies is the one thing in my life where there's no compromising.","With Romeo and Juliet, you're talking about two people who meet one night, and get married the same night. I believe in love at first sight-but it hasn't happened to me yet.","I had a period when I was sixteen where I started to get a big head. I was going through puberty, and I was nominated for an Academy Award. My head got inflated. My friends were the real ones who said, 'You're acting different.' But the truth is that I don't need that, because I don't get out of hand.","I remember reading the book in high school and always thinking of Gatsby as this strong, stoic, suave, mysterious man who had everything under control. But when I read it as an adult, I realised he is a hollow man, a shell of a person trying to find meaning, who is not completely in touch with reality.","I don't see why I can't have friends of both sexes without wild rumors being circulated. It's crazy.","I don't think I ever expected anything like an Oscar ever, to tell you the truth. That is not my motivation when I do these roles. I really am motivated by being able to work with great people and create a body of work that I can look back and be proud of.","I really hate relaxing. I've done three movies in a row, worked for two years straight, and to me, idle time is the devil's workshop. I like to focus on something.","School, I never truly got the knack of. I could never focus on things I didn't want to learn. Math is just the worst. To this day, I can't concentrate on it. People always say, 'You should have tried harder.' But actually, I cheated a lot because I could not sit and do homework.","I love scuba diving, and I've been up and down the Amazon.","As a kid, I was going to be a marine biologist or an actor. When I became successful as an actor, I said, 'Well, maybe I can lend a voice to this with an equal passion.' You realize how lucky we are and how destructive we've been and what little regard we have for the natural world.","Don't think for a moment that I'm really like any of the characters I've played. I'm not. That's why it's called 'acting'.","I've never been Romeo who meets a girl and falls for her immediately. It's been a much slower process for me each time I've gone into a relationship.","I think I will always feel like an outsider.","I have very little fashion sense, and to tell you the truth, I give it very little thought. I dress to be as comfortable as I possibly can. Most of my clothing is either black, grey, or dark blue, and I don't really wear a lot of colours. But I do like jackets. I have a little bit of an obsession with them.","To be honest, I'm not really prepared to do a musical, simply because I think I have a pretty atrocious voice.","I am trying to do the best work I possibly can and making movies that will have resonance for years to come. I think if you try for an Oscar or a goal like that, the more people are going to see it as transparent. It's not on my radar. If it happens, great, but I'm happy to continue working as I am, really.","I have a production company,; I have a foundation. I have a lot of responsibilities. Not family - just a lot of responsibilities.","A great white jumped into my cage when I was diving in South Africa. Half its body was in the cage, and it was snapping at me.","Television is better than it's ever been in history. A lot of stories are being pushed - because of how complicated they are to make - toward Netflix and other channels on cable.","Considering all that's happened in my life, I feel like I'm a pretty levelheaded person that has remained happy and not let my shortcomings overtake the better part of me. I'm fulfilling the things I wanted to fulfill, and I'm still sane.","My parents, who were split up, were so good at keeping my environment strong and keeping everything around me not focused on the fact that we were poor. They got me culture. They took me to museums. They showed art to me. They read to me. And my mother drove two hours a day to take me to University Elementary School.","I don't watch anything of mine much. I haven't gone to drama school, or college, either. I just like to watch other actors in action. I learned so much from working with De Niro. I'd be in a scene with him where I was supposed to be acting, and I was just watching.","I can remember getting rejected systematically by casting directors as a young kid. I felt like the biggest outsider there ever was; that I'd never belong in that club.","I don't ask other actors questions. I think that's too intrusive. I just watch. I don't want to be constricted to an idea of what acting is by anyone else. I want to take my own education.","When a role for a young guy is being offered to me, I think of River Phoenix. It feels like a loss.","I get a friend to travel with me... I need somebody to bring me back to who I am. It's hard to be alone.","School, I never truly got the knack of. I could never focus on things I didn't want to learn.","I've managed to keep a clear head and remain sane in this business because I remain a kid off-camera.","The good thing about acting is that it always keeps you on your toes... It's not like any other job where you can go in and do the same thing as yesterday.","There is a lot of speculation about what women are attracted to, and there are a lot of misconceptions.","I just really love doing what I do. I know every career is fleeting and there will be time periods when I don't get the opportunities that I'm getting right now, so I am taking advantage of them.","Being dubbed as a hunk sort of annoys me. It gives me a yucky feeling.","Women have been the most persecuted people throughout all of recorded history, more than any race or religion.","I certainly don't eat raw bison liver on a regular basis.","I took some time off after 'Titanic' because I needed to let the dust settle and recharge my battery. I felt, 'OK, you've been given a tremendous opportunity; what are you going to do with it? Now your name can finance movies that you do want to do.'","I've gotten to go to far-off places in the world, have very unique, isolated, intense experiences for four or five months at a time, and then, kind of like a dream, those things disappear. You may see those people again, but it's never, ever going to be as intense as it was for that time period.","I'm just starting to scratch the surface of what really makes me happy and it's taken me a while to admit that acting like a little child and being a jerk and a punk is fun.","Portraying emotionally ill characters gives me the chance to really act.","The best thing about acting is that I get to lose myself in another character and actually get paid for it... It's a great outlet. I'm not really sure who I am - it seems I change every day.","I'm probably not going to get married unless I live with somebody for 10 or 20 years. But these people (Romeo and Juliet) took a chance and they did it. We don't have the balls that Romeo did.","You do need parental guidance and I was in a great position with both my mum and dad. They split when I was a baby but even though I stayed with my mom they were both very much involved in my upbringing.","My friends have named me the person they least want to do extreme adventures with, because I always seem to be very close to being part of a disaster. If a cat has nine lives, I think I've used a few.","The bottom line is, when it comes to an actor and his performance, whether nominated or not, it simply has to do with whether that character had enough resonance with the audience. You know, to the filmgoers. And that something that you can't control.","There are a lot of directors I'd still love to work with. Paul Thomas Anderson is someone I'd love to work with. I think Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu is very talented. Ang Lee is very talented. I mean, there are a lot of people. There are many great directors out there.","I am friends with Demi. Don't believe anything you read.","I couldn't deal with playing a character who rides motorcycles and has a leather jacket and is a tough kid, y'know?","I've always been spontaneous and outgoing... I've tried lots of things so I've got some good life experiences, which is great 'cause it means I've got lots of material to work with as an actor.","Money was always on my mind when I was growing up. So I was always wondering how we were going to afford this and that. Acting seemed to be a shortcut out of the mess.","It's easy to fall into the trap of believing all the hype that's written about you... Who knows? In a couple of years, you might find me in the loony bin!","I like to be able to play a character and act out a lot of things which I can't or don't do in my normal everyday life.","I was always the kid in school who tried to get attention, not necessarily the class clown, but I'd do little unexpected performances.","I've been planted here to be a vessel for acting... That's why I'm really taking any part, regardless of how complicated it's going to be.","I really don't know what I'm doing... I don't. It's terrible. I go in there and I learn how to be like the character and do the best I can, and that's all I really do.","Brothers don't necessarily have to say anything to each other - they can sit in a room and be together and just be completely comfortable with each other.","I didn't know what types of movies I wanted to do. I want to do things that are different. I want to take my time with each role.","I want to be a jerk like the rest of my friends, and have fun, and not care about the consequences, but I just can't now.","The role of Rimbaud is one of the most important roles to play for a young actor.","Meryl Streep does things I would never have thought possible... Her presence on screen is outstanding.","I just want to keep doing what I'm doing and hopefully people will watch my movies.","I realise that I do not change the course of history. I am an actor, I do a movie, that's the end of it. You have to realise we are just clowns for hire. After I had success it was great, at first, not to worry about money. It was on my mind when I was growing up.","My father, George, has also affected the choices in my life regarding films. I like films that take chances or say something different or experiment. Growing up with him, I was surrounded by different artists - not just actors or film-makers but cartoonists, poets, writers.","I have learned from my experiences in this industry that there is absolutely no way to control people's opinions on your performance in your movie. You go out there, promote your film and hope people like the work you did.","I grew up when I was 15 when I had my first opportunity in movies. I watched every great movie for a year and a half, and since then I've asked myself how I can emulate such artistry. That's really my motivation. I want to do something as good as my heroes have done.","Hoover was incredibly ambitious as a young man. He was highly motivated to succeed in Washington, primarily due to his mother's expectations of him.","I play fictitious characters often solving fictitious problems. I believe mankind has looked at climate change in the same way, as if it were a fiction.","Hopefully I've gotten better as an actor as the years have gone on, but the type of work I want to do has never changed.","I was a bit of a loudmouth, and I was in an environment where the elements aligned to have kids smack the hell outta me once in a while.","I like stories in specific time periods. 'The Revenant's' era of American history was fascinating because it was this lawless no-man's land. It defined the idea of the American frontiersman as man conquering nature. In a way, the story of Hugh Glass is about man dominating nature.","I am completely open to doing a romantic comedy, but I will never do something just for the sake of doing a specific genre or because it's the time or place to do a different type of movie. I think that would be a huge mistake.","It's always this grand search in the industry to find good material. Whenever there is good material, they all jump on it, and it's like a food fight to get it made. That's why so many things take years and years to develop because it all shows up on screen.","I have to say that whatever decisions I make, I really do think that movie making is a director's medium. They are the people that ultimately shape the film, and a director can take great material and turn it into garbage if they are not capable of making a good movie.","People are always like, 'It must be so hard for you, not to be able to leave your house. I'm like, 'No, I go where I want and do whatever I want all the time.' 'No, you walk down the street?' 'Yeah, I do all the time.' 'Really?' 'Yeah, all the time.'","I went to a concert once when I was a little kid and ran up onstage, started dancing, started saying anything that came to my head. I was like a little vaudevillian.","I did imitations of anyone who came to my parents' house, and that was my identity at school - if there were ten minutes to lunch, and the teacher was done with the lesson, he'd say, 'Okay, Leo, get up there and do something.'","I haven't died in a movie in a while,'The Departed,' 'Body of Lies,' 'Revolutionary Road,' 'Shutter Island' and 'Inception.' I guess I did die in 'The Departed.'","When I started acting, I didn't think of it as a career. I always thought Hollywood was this magical world where a fairy came down and said, 'Come live with the Munchkins; you are now one of us.' I didn't understand the concept of it as a career. I thought I would save up enough money to go to college.","I saw all the moral decay you could, beginning at 2 years old. But I also got to see how the other half lived.","When I was 14, I was on the cover of 'Bop' and 'Tiger Beat.' Every two months, I would see a new kid's face, and I remember saying, 'This is not something that lasts very long.'","My parents know I was outgoing as a child, and whenever people came over, I'd automatically do impressions of them as soon as they left; it was my mom's favorite thing. Yes, I grew up in Hollywood, but not in any rich neighborhood.","My love of performing goes way back. My mom got me on 'Romper Room' when I was five - it was my favorite show. But they couldn't control me. I would run up and smack the camera, and I'd jump around and do my little flips and routines. I wish I could get that tape now.","I've never done drugs. That's because I saw this stuff literally every day when I was 3 or 4 years old.","Hollywood is a very volatile place where artists come in, and they essentially say they want to belong. It's incredibly vulnerable to be an actor and also get criticism at a young age when you're formulating who you are. We've seen a lot of people fall victim to that, and it's very unfortunate.","I've always been a slow starter. My first date was with a girl called Cessi. We had a beautiful relationship over the phone all summer, and then when we met, I couldn't look her in the eye.","When you are given an opportunity to make a film like 'Body of Lies' - and I would put 'Blood Diamond' in the same category - of course you jump at these opportunities.","If a studio is going to offer me the opportunity to invite my mother and grandmother and all my friends to visit me free of charge in Thailand, I'm going to take that opportunity.","I believe, you know, as history unfolds, certain films will disappear, and certain ones will stand the test of time. And you never know which ones those are. And you've just got to go for the opportunities of films you think might be memorable.","I've been a pretty lucky man.","I don't know if I'm more confident than ever before, because I definitely had confidence when I was starting out. Maybe I have less confidence now that I did then.","I am not of the vein of actors - and I will not pretend to be one - that takes my character home with me. I don't."],"Leonardo da Vinci":["Tears come from the heart and not from the brain.","While I thought that I was learning how to live, I have been learning how to die.","Who sows virtue reaps honor.","I love those who can smile in trouble, who can gather strength from distress, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but they whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves their conduct, will pursue their principles unto death.","Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.","Why does the eye see a thing more clearly in dreams than the imagination when awake?","Learning never exhausts the mind.","As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a life well spent brings happy death.","The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding.","Water is the driving force of all nature.","Nothing strengthens authority so much as silence.","The greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions.","For once you have tasted flight you will walk the earth with your eyes turned skywards, for there you have been and there you will long to return.","Art is never finished, only abandoned.","Nature is the source of all true knowledge. She has her own logic, her own laws, she has no effect without cause nor invention without necessity.","The human foot is a masterpiece of engineering and a work of art.","In rivers, the water that you touch is the last of what has passed and the first of that which comes; so with present time.","Time stays long enough for anyone who will use it.","The beginnings and ends of shadow lie between the light and darkness and may be infinitely diminished and infinitely increased. Shadow is the means by which bodies display their form. The forms of bodies could not be understood in detail but for shadow.","Iron rusts from disuse; water loses its purity from stagnation... even so does inaction sap the vigor of the mind.","Where the spirit does not work with the hand, there is no art.","Intellectual passion drives out sensuality.","I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.","He who loves practice without theory is like the sailor who boards ship without a rudder and compass and never knows where he may cast.","A beautiful body perishes, but a work of art dies not.","There are three classes of people: those who see, those who see when they are shown, those who do not see.","It's easier to resist at the beginning than at the end.","Every action needs to be prompted by a motive.","To such an extent does nature delight and abound in variety that among her trees there is not one plant to be found which is exactly like another; and not only among the plants, but among the boughs, the leaves and the fruits, you will not find one which is exactly similar to another.","People talk to people who perceive nothing, who have open eyes and see nothing; they shall talk to them and receive no answer; they shall adore those who have ears and hear nothing; they shall burn lamps for those who do not see.","Life well spent is long.","Where there is shouting, there is no true knowledge.","The smallest feline is a masterpiece.","The natural desire of good men is knowledge.","Our life is made by the death of others.","You can have no dominion greater or less than that over yourself.","I have always felt it is my destiny to build a machine that would allow man to fly.","Blinding ignorance does mislead us. O! Wretched mortals, open your eyes!","The length of a man's outspread arms is equal to his height.","The spirit desires to remain with its body, because, without the organic instruments of that body, it can neither act, nor feel anything.","All our knowledge has its origins in our perceptions.","He who wishes to be rich in a day will be hanged in a year.","Poor is the pupil who does not surpass his master.","The human bird shall take his first flight, filling the world with amazement, all writings with his fame, and bringing eternal glory to the nest whence he sprang.","Medicine is the restoration of discordant elements; sickness is the discord of the elements infused into the living body.","He who is fixed to a star does not change his mind.","Time abides long enough for those who make use of it.","Nature never breaks her own laws.","Weight, force and casual impulse, together with resistance, are the four external powers in which all the visible actions of mortals have their being and their end.","I have found that, in the composition of the human body as compared with the bodies of animals, the organs of sense are duller and coarser. Thus, it is composed of less ingenious instruments, and of spaces less capacious for receiving the faculties of sense.","It is better to imitate ancient than modern work.","The painter who draws merely by practice and by eye, without any reason, is like a mirror which copies every thing placed in front of it without being conscious of their existence.","Each man is always in the middle of the surface of the earth and under the zenith of his own hemisphere, and over the centre of the earth.","Human subtlety will never devise an invention more beautiful, more simple or more direct than does nature because in her inventions nothing is lacking, and nothing is superfluous.","Marriage is like putting your hand into a bag of snakes in the hope of pulling out an eel.","It seems that it had been destined before that I should occupy myself so thoroughly with the vulture, for it comes to my mind as a very early memory, when I was still in the cradle, a vulture came down to me, he opened my mouth with his tail and struck me a few times with his tail against my lips.","Just as food eaten without appetite is a tedious nourishment, so does study without zeal damage the memory by not assimilating what it absorbs.","For, verily, great love springs from great knowledge of the beloved object, and if you little know it, you will be able to love it only little or not at all.","You do ill if you praise, but worse if you censure, what you do not understand.","Just as courage is the danger of life, so is fear its safeguard.","Necessity is the mistress and guide of nature. Necessity is the theme and inventress of nature, her curb and her eternal law.","How many emperors and how many princes have lived and died and no record of them remains, and they only sought to gain dominions and riches in order that their fame might be ever-lasting.","All knowledge which ends in words will die as quickly as it came to life, with the exception of the written word: which is its mechanical part.","There are four Powers: memory and intellect, desire and covetousness. The two first are mental and the others sensual. The three senses: sight, hearing and smell cannot well be prevented; touch and taste not at all.","Science is the captain, and practice the soldiers.","The painter who is familiar with the nature of the sinews, muscles, and tendons, will know very well, in giving movement to a limb, how many and which sinews cause it; and which muscle, by swelling, causes the contraction of that sinew; and which sinews, expanded into the thinnest cartilage, surround and support the said muscle.","I have offended God and mankind because my work didn't reach the quality it should have.","In order to arrive at knowledge of the motions of birds in the air, it is first necessary to acquire knowledge of the winds, which we will prove by the motions of water in itself, and this knowledge will be a step enabling us to arrive at the knowledge of beings that fly between the air and the wind.","Although nature commences with reason and ends in experience it is necessary for us to do the opposite, that is to commence with experience and from this to proceed to investigate the reason.","The divisions of Perspective are 3, as used in drawing; of these, the first includes the diminution in size of opaque objects; the second treats of the diminution and loss of outline in such opaque objects; the third, of the diminution and loss of colour at long distances.","Painting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight; which are: Darkness, Light, Solidity and Colour, Form and Position, Distance and Propinquity, Motion and Rest.","The mind of the painter must resemble a mirror, which always takes the colour of the object it reflects and is completely occupied by the images of as many objects as are in front of it.","Men of lofty genius when they are doing the least work are most active.","The poet ranks far below the painter in the representation of visible things, and far below the musician in that of invisible things.","Just as courage imperils life, fear protects it.","Anyone who conducts an argument by appealing to authority is not using his intelligence; he is just using his memory.","Man and animals are in reality vehicles and conduits of food, tombs of animals, hostels of Death, coverings that consume, deriving life by the death of others.","The function of muscle is to pull and not to push, except in the case of the genitals and the tongue.","The senses are of the earth, the reason stands apart from them in contemplation.","Many are they who have a taste and love for drawing, but no talent; and this will be discernible in boys who are not diligent and never finish their drawings with shading.","Our body is dependant on Heaven and Heaven on the Spirit.","I have wasted my hours.","The Medici created and destroyed me.","Beyond a doubt truth bears the same relation to falsehood as light to darkness.","Knowledge of the past and of the places of the earth is the ornament and food of the mind of man.","Experience never errs; it is only your judgments that err by promising themselves effects such as are not caused by your experiments.","As every divided kingdom falls, so every mind divided between many studies confounds and saps itself.","There is no object so large but that at a great distance from the eye it does not appear smaller than a smaller object near.","The truth of things is the chief nutriment of superior intellects.","Common Sense is that which judges the things given to it by other senses.","Experience does not err. Only your judgments err by expecting from her what is not in her power."],"Leonhard Euler":["Mathematicians have tried in vain to this day to discover some order in the sequence of prime numbers, and we have reason to believe that it is a mystery into which the human mind will never penetrate.","For since the fabric of the universe is most perfect and the work of a most wise Creator, nothing at all takes place in the universe in which some rule of maximum or minimum does not appear.","To those who ask what the infinitely small quantity in mathematics is, we answer that it is actually zero. Hence there are not so many mysteries hidden in this concept as they are usually believed to be.","Madam, I have come from a country where people are hanged if they talk."],"Leonid Hurwicz":["Legal behavior is not incompatible with rational, self-interested behavior.","A game is defined by the players' strategy domains and payoff functions.","A need for enforcement implies the possibility of behavior that violates the rules of the game. The point is that if there were no possibility of violation, then you wouldn't need enforcement.","Just because there are people who violate rules, behave illegally and so on, it does not mean that everybody is like that. On the contrary, if you watch certain judges, you observe that they honestly try to implement what they believe the Constitution says and just put it into effect.","My father was convinced, I think rightly, that if he stayed in Russia, he would have trouble with Lenin.","I had the belief that many troubles you could observe on the European continent were due to politicians not understanding economic phenomena. Even if they had good intentions, they didn't have the skills to solve problems.","When you talk about the economic process of a society, sometimes we separate it into two stories. One is about monetary variables. But then, we very often assume the underlying arrangement, the other variable, is 'perfect competition,' which means people do whatever they are supposed to do.","There are two kinds of games in economics. One is the game where people use only legal moves. Then there is the true game, the one like real life, where the strategies and moves people make, some of them contain illegal gains."],"Leonid I.

While the damage we've done is irreversible, that doesn't give us the right to do nothing.","What we owe future generations is the subject of growing debate by economists, philosophers, ethicists, public policymakers, and academics of all stripes. But for me as a mother, the moral implications are very clear. We owe them clean air and fresh water, a healthy planet and a secure future.","I don't need jewels and cars. It's about the delicacy of the way I'm handled.","When we strip away the clothes, the jewelry, that's who we really are. I walk around naked in my house.","Ask any parent what we want for our children, and invariably we say 'a better life.' To that end, we give our time, our sleep, our money, and our dreams, much as our parents did before us. We all want a better life for our children. But what we want for them ceases to matter if we leave them an unlivable world.","I don't believe in nudity for nudity's sake, but it's really beautiful when it's done well, when it's within a story. I'm very comfortable with my body. I grew up mostly in France, where nudity is not taboo.","I'm not good with limitations. I tend to like to find my own. It hurts sometimes, but it's good.

What death is, I don't know.","In the political confusion and the torrid heat, I convinced myself that Madrid was the world's stomach and that I had been chosen for the task of restoring this digestive organ to health.","You don't decide to paint. It's like getting hungry and going to the kitchen to eat. It's a need, not a choice.","I suppose what I believe in is peaceful anarchy.","I have always thought - and a lot of people won't agree with this - that we're incredibly driven by fear, basically. Aren't we? It's awful to be frightened. I think it's a very strong, very powerful thing, fear.","I hated being in a convent. It's another form of power. Manipulation. Because who can say - one God for the whole universe? I think there must be millions of gods! And they're not all of them very nice.","I do miss England. Well, I miss the idea of England, I think. But I haven't been back for years. I probably just miss the past.","I never thought of myself as a Surrealist. I didn't think of myself as anything. I try not to.

This is retaliation and selective repression.","The infrastructure, institutions and social fabric of Venezuela are deteriorating, and people realize the Chavez government has been the problem, not the solution.","Repressive regimes do not endure change willingly - and Venezuela is no exception.","We must not allow the practices of an anti-democratic State that abuses the powers of government to violate the human rights of Venezuelans.","A national primary election would electrify the people and give them a larger stake in the outcome.","Our arguments - and those of hundreds more Venezuelans suffering the same injustice - are clear and forceful: political disqualification violates laws in Venezuela and throughout the continent."],"Leos Carax":["I travel, I read, I write, I have other lives. But when I have a camera, I know that's my country, my island.","I changed my name when I was 13. I don't know why but it made sense at the time. I wanted another identity. I wanted to reinvent myself.","I've always been interested in invisible worlds, and I like to visit digital worlds, you know, any world that's imposed on us.","When I was 16, I felt very relieved to discover cinema. It was like an island where I could see life and death from another perspective. Every young person should be interested in that island. It's a beautiful place.","I don't work with people who ask me questions.","We all get a little tired of being ourselves sometimes. The answer is to reinvent yourself, but how do you do that and what is the cost?","When I was 16, I discovered this island called cinema and I thought: 'Oh, how wonderful; I'm ready.'","I don't think men were meant to be interviewed.","I mostly don't submit to talking about my work because I would like another talk about real life.","Men talk about art, and artists make art, but should artists talk?","When I made my first film, I had hardly ever seen a camera before, and I was a young man when I arrived in Paris from the suburbs. At the time, I didn't talk much. I was very shy, so the bluff served me. I was telling people that I had no money, and that I knew how to make films, but I had no proof.","My films start with images, a few images and a few feelings, and I try to edit them together to see the correspondence between these images and these feelings.","I'm not especially interested in actors or their life, double, triple identities and all that.","I'm not a cineaste. I've made so few films. Sometimes it feels each one is the last one or the first one.","I'm not only my films, but I'm pretty much my films.","Video is freeing, but also lazier. You have to recreate the love of the moment.","Cinema is a territory. It exists outside of movies. It's a place I live in. It's a way of seeing things, of experiencing life. But making films, that's supposed to be a profession.","I'm not against the virtual world; it's fascinating, but I don't like the way they try to impose it on us. It's a thing imposed by rich countries.","The virtual world is not the enemy. The pioneers invented a world they believed in, but the followers must follow that world whether they believe in it or not.","I like tragedies, whether they're sci-fi or something else, but I can't say I know much about any genre in particular.","There's a real cowardice in the movie business. If you don't meet the right crazy people, you can't do it.","I feel that cinema is my country. But it's not my business.","Every film starts with two or three images. Then I try to edit these images.","Even a fiction film is hard to end. You can going on shooting and editing a documentary forever.","I care about cinema even though I haven't made many films."],"Leroy Chiao":["One of my challenges was to try to photograph the Great Wall of China. And I did actually take some photos, but it was hard to discern the wall with the naked eye.","But a lot of that kind of work is done pre-flight, coordinating efforts with the flight directors and the ground teams, and figuring out how you're going to operate together.","Coming down under a parachute is quite different as well. You hit the ground pretty hard, but all the systems work very well to keep it from hurting, so it doesn't even hurt when you hit. It was a great experience to be able to do both.","I had done everything I could do as an astronaut, and we have a long line of inexperienced astronauts waiting for their first missions, and so my role really should be to step aside and help them prepare for their missions, rather than to try to get another mission.","I hope that China will continue with space exploration. It would be logical to have international co-operation. I hope that it will come about and that I can be involved in it.","I loved flying as much as I thought I would and continue to fly aircraft.","I spent a lot of my time working in the American module, and he would stay in the Russian segment working on his things, and we'd meet up at meal times. So it actually worked out very well.","I think it's good to have competition. Now we have a third country that can launch astronauts, so it's good for all of us. It makes us a little bit more competitive and wanting to be the leader.","I would say keep supporting space flight, keep telling the public and the politicians why it's important to advance science and explore the galaxy. I encourage the Japanese to keep doing what they're doing.","I'm Chinese-American, of course, and so it's very interesting to see China actually launch their own astronauts, becoming the third nation, following the United States and Russia, to do so.","Of course, you'll have to meet the physical and psychological demands. A space walk takes a lot of energy.","One day, people will be able to buy tickets to visit space.","Our task was doing maintenance and repairs to keep the station in a good state for the return of the shuttle flights and resumption of major ISS construction.","The most interesting thing was looking out the window and taking photographs of different places on Earth.","There is no one area of chemical engineering that specifically helped me in my career as an astronaut, it was more the general education in engineering. Also, it was a very difficult and rigorous course. So, it made me strong and resourceful.","There were different challenges along the way. Certainly the food shortage was unpleasant.","Tinkering is something we need to know how to do in order to keep something like the space station running. I am a tinkerer by nature.","Well, it's still a bit uncertain, but I will do the consulting, and I'll see how I can contribute. But I'm sure whatever I do will involve the space program. That's where my passion is."],"Leroy Hood":["Don't underestimate the power of your vision to change the world. Whether that world is your office, your community, an industry or a global movement, you need to have a core belief that what you contribute can fundamentally change the paradigm or way of thinking about problems.","If you just focus on the smallest details, you never get the big picture right.","If you look at healthcare today, it's all about disease. It's not about understanding wellness at all.","The wellness and prevention market will outgrow the health care market.","My fundamental philosophy is that you owe it to society to transfer to them any knowledge you have that might be useful.","Changing the world is not easy, but its pursuit will change you profoundly.","Cloning interferon was not something I wanted to get into.","Your genome sequence will become a vital part of your medical record, thereby providing critical information about how to optimize your wellness.","An important finding is that by determining the genome sequences of an entire family, one can identify many DNA sequencing errors and thus greatly increase the accuracy of the data. This will ultimately help us understand the role of genetic variations in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.","To manipulate the immune system, you need to find the key bottlenecks that govern the system. The T-cell is an absolute bottleneck.","All of the details that most of us memorize in medical school - you don't have to learn those things. They're going to be in your computer.","Anybody that thought the genome was going to directly provide drugs was a fool. Biological networks are not simple, and making drugs to affect them won't be simple.","What is unique about humans is their individuality.","Genes are natural resources.","We don't argue if drug companies create drugs that can cure humans and charge lots of money for them, even though we all have these diseases. It will be pretty hard to make a different argument for genes.","Almost never does a single company have excellence in a multiplicity of disciplines.","Data-intensive graph problems abound in the Life Science drug discovery and development process.","The Human Genome Project has given us a genetic parts list.","If a startup stays in Microsoft, it does not have a chance, because all it tries to do goes against what Microsoft is about.","Life is a process of evolution.","The major thing is to view biology as an information science.","The systems approach to biology will be the dominant theme in medicine.","Breast cancer isn't one disease - it's probably four or five different types, and without knowing what type a person has, you can't optimize treatment for them.","Medicine will be personalized and preventive: Your genome might predict that you have an 80 percent chance of breast cancer by the time you are 50, but if you take a preventive drug starting when you are 40, the chance will drop to 2 percent.","If you know the mother's genome and the father's genome, and you see that the children have some genes that neither parent has, then you know that difference is either a mutation or a processing error.","Each form of Alzheimer's disease should perturb different brain networks and so influence the concentration of different proteins that can be measured in the blood.","I have good genes, and I also do lots of exercises.","I didn't want my genome to be sequenced by any of the companies that were out there doing the partial sequences just from the point of view of commercialisation.","My own view about knowledge is we're always better to have knowledge.","We are evolutionary descendents of this marvellous panoply of life. And what that says unequivocally is we have an utter total obligation to make sure we have an environment that not only is good for us but is good for all living organisms.","I think the real problem is it's easy to persuade young kids of particular kinds of ideas, because they are flexible.","In the late 1970s, when I was a professor at Caltech, I pioneered four instruments for analyzing genes and proteins that revolutionized modern biology - and one of these, the automated DNA sequencer, enabled the Human Genome Project.","Many nonprofits rely on grants alone.","Don't listen to the prevailing majority points of view. If you have new ideas, push them.","If you go to the FDA with a drug that's only meant to treat 50 people, and it's a 95 percent cure rate, you'll get your drug approved.","In the end, what counts is what you do.","I already get 10 job offers a year, which is more than I can handle anyway.","What you need to learn how to do is analyze situations and do differential diagnoses and understand the principle and the concepts rather than learn all the details, and medical school doesn't begin to do that.","For some people, it's best for their mental health to know they have the gene for Huntington's and some time in the future they'll have a problem.

At the end of the '90s, it just wasn't fun anymore on many levels.","You know, there are times when you play a song over and over and over and you get a little tired of it and you let it sit for a while. It's like, you may love eating sushi, but if you eat it every single day, you're going to get a little tired of it.","My heroes are guys like Frank Capra and Elia Kazan and Coen brothers and Terry Gilliam, more so than a lot of bass players at this point in my life. So I've always been an old-film nut and have very much enjoyed doing videos over the years.","I love character actors. If I'm switching channels, and something with Slim Pickens is on, or Walter Brennan, I'm stuck. I have to watch it.","You can't watch 'Dr. Strangelove' with commercials. That would be sacrilegious.","Daniel Day-Lewis is my favorite actor walking the planet right now. He never ceases to amaze me.","I've always said the bass just happens to be the crayon I picked out of the box. I'd still be drawing the same pictures... should I have picked trumpet or accordion or guitar, whatever it may be. The sounds in my head are still the same.","Band chemistry is a tricky thing. If one guy isn't feeling right with the other guys, everything gets thrown off. When you get the personalities and the chemistry right, that's a grand slam.","If I'm home and I come up with something, I'll try to record it, but a lot of the time I'll forget to. A lot of things go off into space and never come back 'cause I just don't remember them.","I don't really listen to bassists - not anymore. When I was younger, I listened to those guys and was trying to figure out everything they did. Nowadays, I draw inspiration from everybody.","For me to do a project - I have a pretty successful solo career, so - for me to even want to do Primus, it had to be a creative step forward.","It's always hard to put your finger on what it is that makes Primus Primus.","I've never been on the cover of 'Tiger Beat' magazine, let's put it that way. But that's not why you go see Primus. You don't go see Primus to see what kind of new clothing I'm wearing or what my new hairdo is.","I have a very difficult time describing my music.","I've just always had a soft spot for character actors.","From my experience, moving through life, things tend to go in eight- to 10-year cycles. Friends, relationships and whatnot.","Comedians get jokes offered to them, rock stars get women and underwear thrown onstage, and I get guys that want to take me fishing.","Play as much as you can as often as you can with as many people as you can. That's how you learn and grow."],"Les Dawson":["The mother-in-law came round last week. It was absolutely pouring down. So I opened the door and I saw her there and I said, 'Mother, don't just stand there in the rain. Go home.'","The way prices are rising, the good old days are last week.","In awe, I watched the waxing moon ride across the zenith of the heavens like an ambered chariot towards the ebony void of infinite space wherein the tethered belts of Jupiter and Mars hang, for ever festooned in their orbital majesty. And as I looked at all this I thought... I must put a roof on this toilet.","I've got a friend who is a lion tamer. He used to be a school teacher till he lost his nerve.","My mother-in-law said, 'One day I will dance on your grave.' I said 'I hope you do; I will be buried at sea.'","Mind you, I've always been musical... Mother used to sit me on her knee and I'd whisper, 'Mummy, Mummy, sing me a lullaby do,' and she'd say: 'Certainly my angel, my wee bundle of happiness, hold my beer while I fetch me banjo.'","My mother-in-law fell down a wishing well. I was amazed; I never knew they worked.","I'm not saying my mother didn't like me, but she kept looking for loopholes in my birth certificate.","I saw six men kicking and punching the mother-in-law. My neighbour said 'Are you going to help?' I said 'No, six should be enough.'","The mother-in-law is the centre of a family.","I'm often accused of saying some pretty rotten things about my mother-in-law. But quite honestly, she's only got one major fault - it's called breathing.","The mother-in-law had an accident at work. A hot rivet dropped down her drawers and she fell off the oil rig.","My mother-in-law has so many wrinkles, when she smiles she looks like a Venetian blind.","I went to the doctor last week. I said: 'Can I have some sleeping pills for the wife?' He said: 'Why?' I said: 'She's woke up.'","My wife sent her photograph to the lonely hearts club. They sent it back, said they weren't that lonely.","My mother-in-law has come round to our house at Christmas seven years running. This year we're having a change. We're going to let her in.","I'd like to thank the BBC for allowing me to work here. And I'd like to thank the wife and kids for making it necessary.","The wife's run off with the bloke next door. I do miss him.","I can always tell when the mother in law's coming to stay; the mice throw themselves on the traps.","I used to sell furniture for a living. The trouble was, it was my own.","My mother-in-law's so fat that when she passes her handbag from hand to hand she throws it.","I took my mother-in-law to Madame Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors, and one of the attendants said: 'Keep her moving sir; we're stock-taking.'","I'm the most unromantic lump of Northern suet. Yes, a woman did accost me once in South Shields, but she had a face like Red Rum.","I discovered the wife's got asthma. Thank God - I thought she was hissing at me.","Take my wife... please. I'm not saying she's ugly, but when she went to see a horror film, the audience thought she was making a personal appearance.","I don't mind what the critics say, so long as I get some reaction. The worst thing is to be ignored.","You do something you're really quite proud of, and the public doesn't like it. Then you do something that perhaps you're not at all happy with and the public loves it. And that's the moment of truth, because it's the audience that's the final judge.","Slumps don't bother me.","When we were courting, I told my wife: 'I could live in your eyes.' She said: 'You'd be at home; there's a stye in one of them.'","I've just had some bad news. Tomorrow is the mother in law's funeral. And she's cancelled it.","My wife is a sex object - every time I ask for sex, she objects.","Marriage is an institution and that's where a couple finish up.","I need to give affection and love, because without that, I wither. I need to give that love to someone. Without that, I'm rudderless.","How can you analyse what is funny? What's funny to one isn't funny to another... What's funny to you is a personal thing.","I toyed with the idea of playing Ravel's 'Pavane pour une infante defunte' but I couldn't remember if it's a tune or Latin prescription for piles.","My lad chewed and swallowed a dictionary. We gave him Epsom salts - but we can't get a word out of him.","I know my name will always be linked with women.","With wives, men hide behind the air of bravado, which is basically a defence mechanism, I think. Clever creatures, women. Very clever.","Despite the fact that feminists say they're not getting a fair deal, women are still very powerful.","When I was a child, I had wax in my ears. Dad didn't take me to the doctor, he used me as a night light."],"Les Paul":["Now I need to take a piece of wood and make it sound like the railroad track, but I also had to make it beautiful and lovable so that a person playing it would think of it in terms of his mistress, a bartender, his wife, a good psychiatrist - whatever.","You can't go to the store and buy a good ear and rhythm.","I have younger friends who don't work, and they aren't doing so well. My secret is to keep going, keep working.","When I got my first guitar my fingers wouldn't go to the sixth string so I took off the big E and played with just five strings. I was only 6 or 7.","As far as I'm concerned, I'm just a guitar player, and my job is to go out there and play and entertain and do my thing.","If I have to go around telling everyone how great I am, then there's something wrong with my act.","The audience, they're not professionals. They just love music. It isn't necessary to play over their heads to be admired.","We go in there and we work on altering those ideas and in many cases go in different directions.","One minute we're over here, the next minute we're doing something completely different. But it's interesting because you are producing so many things you couldn't do with analog.","I used my mother's radio as a PA system. I'd take the telephone, the speaking part, and take those two leads off and lead them into the radio and the sound would come out of the speaker.","I wanted something very dense, something that would sustain long and more pieces of wood that would be soft, sweet, for more of a mellow sound.","You learn fast from others how to be an entertainer as well as a musician; you don't necessarily have to get out there and just play - you can be an entertainer, too.","There are times when you want to go where you used to go and you can't go there."],"Les Wexner":["As an entrepreneur, you work out solutions.","Entrepreneurs, guys that start businesses, grow with them. It's more painful than it would appear.","Sometimes I wish I lived more in the day, but I'm happier thinking about tomorrow or the day after. The way I see it, there's always a new or next thing.","Growing up, I knew you were supposed to have a profession - and something better than being a shopkeeper, which is what my parents were.","A woman at the Limited once asked me, 'Why do you work?' She said, 'You made a lot of money as a young man, so why are you still working?' I had never thought about it before. Forced to consider it, I told her, 'You know why? Because I think that if you stop to smell the roses, you'll get hit by a truck.'","In the '70s and '80s, the mentality of America was that everything was disposable. The notion of quality wasn't important.","I don't think most analysts understand that whether I work a 70-hour week or an 80-hour week, I take my head with me when I go home."],"Lesley Ann Warren":["Trust your own instincts, go inside, follow your heart. Right from the start. go ahead and stand up for what you believe in. As I've learned, that's the path to happiness.","Good work is good work wherever it is.","I have come far, but not far enough. It is still a man's world.","I know that some people work differently, but I have to work from the inside out. It doesn't matter how big the character is, there has to be a truthful core.","You have to be really willing to embrace life and life's turns, and play that for your audience, because there is value in every moment of that journey.","Human beings have to create hope. They have to. You have to have something you hold onto as being a possibility. Otherwise, why go on?","I'm a gigantic musical film fan.","I came from the musical stage. My first show was '110 In The Shade.' I started as a ballet dancer and then sort of gravitated toward musical theater, so any time I got asked to sing or dance, it was a joy for me.","I was terrified, terrified in 'Songwriter,' because there I was, New York Jewish girl, singing country-western onstage with Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson. I mean, forget it. I was so terrified.","The truth is, I would do anything for Alan Rudolph. If he asked me to stand on my head and spit wooden nickels, I would. I love him. I loved working with him.","I've been a character actress right from the beginning. I was no more like 'Cinderella' in my real life than I was like the neurotic poet in 'Cop.'"],"Lesley Garrett":["I do hope that our spring will be starting shortly and we will all be able to enjoy some sunshine again.","I saw The Sound of Music when I was 10 and thought that it was the most beautiful singing I had ever heard.","I don't think I have ever met a single person who isn't moved by music of some kind.","I performed in Sydney some years ago for the Sydney Festival and I am just so pleased to be returning to the wonderful Sydney Opera House and also performing in Melbourne for the first time.","As far as I was concerned the important thing was that the music was getting the attention as well as me so it was always a great way to get more of the public to connect with classical music, and opera particularly.","One of the problems that we face through the media attention that these artists receive is that there has been an awful lot of talk about opera and classical music being elite and being for an elitist group.","What people really should be able to be confident in is that the standards of music- making that classically trained musicians present is elite, it is the best and all of us as artists should be committed to that.","I don't just come from a musical family, but from a musical community.","The musical heritage of Yorkshire is deep and wide.","And woven into the fabric of this harsh existence was music.","I'm very pro presenting the best music I can to the widest audience possible.","Singing is an arduous business and it needs sacrifices.","I do a lot of vocal hygiene.","I'm engaging my diaphragm as I'm speaking to you right now.","There are a lot of unseen elements to having a successful singing career.","It worries me that young singers think you can shortcut the training and go straight to fame and fortune, and programmes like Pop Idol have encouraged that.","I wouldn't want to criticise someone like Charlotte Church because she has done fantastically well, but personally I've always cared about the long term.","To tell you the truth, I never listen to opera at home.","Nobody inspired me more than Julie Andrews, who is a classically trained soprano herself.","That was when I realised that music is the most profound, magical form of communication there is.","Music is there to access those dark emotional corners that we don't normally get too close to.","Opera is credible drama now, and it costs less than going to a football match. What have you got to lose?","I would just like to say that opera is no longer about fat people in breastplates shattering wine glasses."],"Lesley Gore":["I still get a chill when I sing, 'You Don't Own Me.' I find some new feeling in it every time.","I wouldn't go so far as to make 'You Don't Own Me' a tango or 'It's My Party' a hip-hop thing. Believe me, those things have been suggested to me. But I thought if I could stay true to the song, the arrangements would work. I'm really enjoying singing them.","We recorded the record on a Saturday afternoon March 30th and I heard the record for the first time on April 6th. I was driving to school, literally seven days later.","Really you just gotta keep chugging along and keep a positive attitude and get through all the problems. You gotta face them, otherwise you don't get through.","I don't know any other lifestyle. I get up in the morning and I really do feel that the world is my oyster, and I start that way, the same as I would if I were preparing to write a song: put a blank piece of paper up on the piano and you go for it.","I just kind of lived my life naturally and did what I wanted to do.","You know, the interesting thing about having traveled around the country as much as I have, and I think it's sort of inadvertently what made me come out or at least begin doing things within the community and thinking more about that, was that I get to travel quite a bit.","I have to say that when I first started singing, I didn't think it was a very noble profession. I worked for people like Robert Kennedy and I thought: 'Wow, that's what it's about. That's how you change the world.' And then I watched that disintegrate in front of my eyes, and it was very discouraging.","Actually, the funny thing is, after all these years, I've got all these new songs to learn for the show we're doing at Joe's Pub, so it's kind of fun to get down and rehearse new things, and also rethink some of the older songs, how we're going to do them.","Given that there was that era of girl group music and it's still very popular, but I think if you looked at the chart from that time you would see many more men on it. Because the industry, they were catering to young girls. I mean, that's what they thought their audience was.","I meet a lot of young people in the Midwest, and I saw what a difference a show like In the Life can make to their lives in some of these small towns where, you know, there are probably two gay people in the whole damn town.","I think I turned to writing really just to wake up in the morning and be a musician and to have something to do, and feel like a musician every day even if I wasn't working.","I think the record industry, by and large what's left of it, is still totally homophobic. I think it's much less so in the film industry now, but the record industry, it's always been a man's world.","You can only bite off so much, so you gotta know what you want to do.","You know, Quincy Jones was a great mentor, but he was a man in a man's world. Fortunately he's a very sensitive man and a beautiful human being, and even though he was 14 or 15 years older than me, he's a capable human being and has great communication skills.","The short story and the truth is that I was taking vocal lessons here in New York... One day, instead of my lesson, the piano player and I went into a studio... and we put down some demos... Those demos got to Quincy Jones through an agent... He listened to them, he called me, and we started to record.","I decided to host a couple of the 'In The Life' programs. And I did that really as a result of meeting a lot of young gay people in the Midwest who really had nothing to relate to. At least I felt this program is presenting them with some options.","I've listened to Eminem rap. That's not daily fare for me, but I can't help but admire how vivid what he does is. My own taste goes a little more toward Norah Jones.","If I've learned anything in this business, how stupid would it be not to do 'It's My Party' when people come to hear it?","I worked with Carl Perkins on a number of shows. Live shows. He just showed up and played. He just killed. Killed! Man... he was amazing!","I had an opportunity to meet Elvis, only once. It was at the MGM Grand. It was certainly not at the height of his career. No, it wasn't at the height of his career, but it was still a thrill to see him and meet him anyway. You know?","I have a bit of a problem with 'American Idol.' Forgive me, but it's difficult for me to watch. I can't help but think of people being exploited. On the other hand, I'm really enjoying 'Glee.'","As far as I'm concerned, collaboration is the essence of life. It's wonderful to be able to have talents, and, very often, we think that we know what our talents are, or we find out through a back door that we have a talent. I know that I found out I was a lyricist quite through a back door.","Frankly, if 'American Idol' was the way I'd have to audition as a singer, I'd be standing behind the counter in a 5&10 right now. I couldn't have done it that way.","I have nothing but the best memories of growing up in New Jersey. Of course, I grew up in a nice town, a suburb. But Tenafly was right next to Englewood, which had a tremendous amount of racial tension in the '60s. So I was aware of the real world.","On 'Sullivan,' you sang live. Not only that, you sang with a 40-piece band. So you had instruments that weren't even on the original record! So this was when the rubber met the road - when you had to really learn how to perform. And it was for 10 or 12 million people. So that was a challenge.","I think that in many ways, gays are behind women and behind blacks, as far as rights go. But I always say, if you know one of us, it's hard to hate us.","I didn't disappear; I started writing songs and worked behind the scenes.","I'm a musical person, and that's what I want my life to be about.","When I wake up in the morning, and I go to the piano, and there's a blank sheet of paper in front of me, by the end of the day, that could be a gold mine. You really do need to wake up and expect that the world is your oyster because it very well may be."],"Lesley Manville":["I still sing, but completely for my own pleasure. I play a nightclub singer in 'Sparkle,' but I'd like to pursue it a bit more. I sang at a friend's 60th at Claridge's the other month; I did 'Baby It's Cold Outside' with the actor Hilton McRae, and 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow.'","I like to personalise my dressing room, have a cover for the bed and, if it is a long run, a few cushions and a teapot - a little pot for one.","One of the significant things that's happened, which shouldn't be looked at as lightly as it might sound, is that women over 45, over 50, are now allowed to be sexy.","I hate that thing that if you are over 45, and you're going to be on telly or make films, you have to do all this stupid stuff to your face. I would no more let someone stick a needle in my forehead than fly to the moon.","I'm quite chameleon in my work - not normally looking much like I do in real life.","It gets easier as you get older because life deals its particular hand, and our experiences get deeper, richer, more profound. When I gave birth to my son, something happened. It is a huge thing for a woman: a whole set of emotions you never had before arrives, and a love you never had before in your life is now on tap.","There isn't a spare minute in the day. I have spent my life doing everything. I work. I go home. I do the shopping. I cook. Then there's the laundry and the dog. Most of my life, I have been a working mother. And even when I wasn't, I still did it all.","When I was eight, it was clear I was a very good singer.","I had two starts, really. The first was going to the Italia Conti stage school, aged 15. I'd gone to sing, but one day I found myself doing an improvisation and thought, 'Oh God, I quite like this acting thing.' The second start was meeting Mike Leigh when I was 22. He showed me I could play people that weren't like me.","A lot of the actors I knew threw in the towel when they became mothers. I couldn't do that financially, and I didn't want to - but I was knackered all the time.","Stage is the ultimate test; I like watching established screen actors on stage to see if they can really do it. But it's great to have a healthy mixture of the two. Film is so technical: there's something very particular about the relationship between you and the camera. It took a long time for me to get good on film.","I quite like that people tend not to know my name. I remember being at the Cannes film festival for 'All or Nothing.' I looked very different in the film - I had a little greasy bob and no makeup. I went to a dinner after the screening, and everyone completely ignored me. I got a real buzz out of that.","I, Lesley, I like looking nice. I like doing my hair and wearing makeup and wearing nice clothes. But I don't care what my characters look like.","When I make films, I work with Mike Leigh, who's the most prolific director in England.","It's not just about young people - there are films being made that deal with women getting older. That's a huge bonus, and here in America, that's a huge step forward.","I have been devoted to my son, and there have been lots of jobs in the past that I haven't done because I didn't want to be away from him.","I've got two older sisters who I'm very close to. And my son's grown up with a big sense of family around him.","My mother always cooked, every day, proper food. We didn't have fast food. It was probably pretty much meat and two veg, but as time went on and new things came into the culture, she embraced all of that. I grew up with mealtimes and sitting around the table with proper cooking and eating.","I completely think of myself as sexual. Completely and utterly. Probably more so than I did when I was 30. I don't know why. I'm very comfortable with how I look. I'm absolutely committed to never having anything done to my face. I would never let anyone near me with a Botox needle.","People say, 'I know you, don't I?' And they expect me to say I know them from their daughter's school or something - they can't place me. And I love that. Long may it last.","I do get clocked in the street. People say, 'You're an actress, aren't you?' But they don't know my name. Nine times out of 10, they don't know what I've been in.","In my work, I want to convince people that I'm that character. If they know everything about Lesley Manville - private life, all of that stuff - it doesn't help. So the kind of anonymity I enjoy is key.","For me, the times in my life when I've been single have been more formative and crucial than I could have imagined. I can cope, function and be happy on my own. I'm highly capable. That doesn't mean I don't like being with a partner, or that I don't feel more rounded when I'm with someone. But the times on my own have been so good.","I was champion soprano of Sussex when I was 16!","When I gave birth to my son, something happened. It is a huge thing for a woman: a whole set of emotions you never had before arrives, and a love you never had before in your life is now on tap.","I do absolutely want to be around as long as possible. I tell my son: 'You do realise, I am going to live to 100.'","I'm a big fan of Edouard Vuillard, so I'd like anything by him - particularly a painting called 'Madame Hessel on the Sofa.' His work is realistic without being literal: I can really imagine what Madame Hessel is thinking.","The thing is this: I've got an amazing career in England that couldn't possibly get much better. I do the best theater around, I work at the National Theater, the Old Vic - which I'm sure you've heard of because it's the one Kevin Spacey runs - and I play the most amazing roles and work with the most amazing directors.","I'm fascinated by food. Food is love, isn't it?","A friend of mine rang the box office to collect a ticket I'd reserved for her, and the girl said, 'Who's Lesley Manville?'","Hollywood... that's not going to be my niche at all. If anyone is going wants to work with me, I would think it's going to be independent films. I'm not 22!","I've reached a point in England where you can't go much further; I would love to come to America and work with some of the interesting directors here.","For Kitty Gilbert in 'Topsy-Turvy,' I had to get to the point where I could improvise in the style of 1880, which is difficult. The research for that was huge.","I had left school at 16, gone to stage school - and, until I was 22, I hadn't really played anyone but myself. Then in 1979, I made a film with Mike Leigh called 'Grownups,' which went out on the BBC, and overnight this new career opened up.","In 1990, I was in 'The Three Sisters' at the Royal Court and won the Clarence Derwent award for my supporting role as Natasha - the prize was £100. I could have paid the gas bill, but I ended up buying a porcelain and silver Bavarian coffee set in an antiques shop in Penzance.","Corinne Bailey Rae I listen to a lot, and I'll hear Desert Island Discs and quickly write down the name of a song, and it will open up a new area of music for me. I discovered an Argentinian guitarist, Jose Luis Bieito, on Classic FM.","If I go away, I take a little picture of my son. It's in a frame with a speaker, and he recorded a birthday message for me when he was nine or 10. I can't listen to it without filling up.","You've got to take responsibility for your own actions. We all know people who reach rock bottom. However much that they're told that what they're doing is harming their own life or whatever, you cannot make someone do it unless that person reaches the point where they know that they have to deal with it themselves.","Anyone who has to write an obituary for me one day will probably say, 'She did absolute depths of agony really well.' I'm not, however, an unhappy person.","I had this exceptional classical music voice. If I'd followed a true path for my talent, I would have ended up being an opera singer.","The more life you have, the more it's in your pores, the more able you are to be creative as an artist.","I try to keep the more uninteresting stuff to a minimum, unless I'm really broke.","For me, personality acting is not that interesting. I don't want to just be myself.","I think that distributors and marketing companies realise that there are a huge number of women over 40 who want to go the cinema and see films about themselves. Women of my age don't want to be force-fed with stuff about 25-year-olds.","With learning lines, before I had Alfie, I'd put it off and think, 'Oh, I'll just have a glass of wine and then do it later,' but when you've finally got a child to bed and you know you've only got an hour, then you achieve so much.","Oh, there's so much ego with men; in their head, they can't possibly think about Tesco's when they are doing Othello. Er, why not? They want to think that they are such geniuses they can't muddy their day with domesticity, and I've got no truck with it whatsoever.","I'm very lucky because I don't half get some juicy jobs. But I can't tell you the number I've turned down in the past 20 years because I wanted to be at home, looking after my son. There was never any question about that. Alfie and I are dead close. I can't bear it when he's away.","The thing is, when you have a child with someone, like it or not, you're going to have to have a continuing relationship with them.","I got invited to what's called the Gifting Suite in Toronto. I had the day off, so I thought I'd go and see what's what. You come out laden with wonderful stuff. Apparently, if you go to the Oscars, you get given things like iPads. Not that I'm in it for the swag.","The more you've lived, the more you've experienced, you emotionally know a lot more, especially if you haven't had a regular, straightforward kind of life.","It would never occur to me not to look dreadful if that's the job description.","I'd love it if doors open for me in America. There are directors I'd love to work with there. I'll always do theater, but I've got to pay the mortgage.","I love playing women at the far ends of the social scale. I've done it all my life; that's where my ability lies."],"Lesley Nicol":["The first meal my husband ever made me was a chicken curry. I have never tasted anything so delicious in my life.","I took a cookery course. On the examination, I had to cook a cheese omelet with peas and an egg custard. With the egg custard, which was supposed to be a dessert, I forget to put the sugar in, so that's more of a quiche, isn't it?","I can do basics, but I'm not a proper cook. I can do a roast. I can stick a chicken in the oven with vegetables.","I mean, I've done musicals, but it's not my best thing.","People have preconceptions about women of a certain age.","I have been invited to do something called 'Celebrity MasterChef' in England, which, of course, I can't do. It's complete nonsense. You have to be a decent cook to begin with. I'd be the joke one.","One of the Sunday newspapers asked me to make my favorite dish, and they photographed me holding it in the kitchen. It was roasted salmon with roasted vegetables. That's not cooking; that's putting things in a pan. It looked quite nice, but I'm not saying it was good.","I think I should be a nightclub singer. I love to sing!","People are always asking me for my favorite recipe, and I have to say, 'I don't really have one.'","I don't do freeways.","Since I've turned 50, I've had the best roles of my life, and I've got married. Everyone said that wasn't possible because there are no men, but I've done it. I think it's just going to get better.","I've been to the White House and had Hilary Clinton push through the crowd to come and meet me. Chelsea Clinton, too.","As an actor, you never know where the work's going to come, so you have to be flexible about it.","At the drop of a hat, people will say there are no roles for women after 40. It's there with a bunch of other rules I'm not interested in.","I met Bette Midler, who I absolutely love.","I'm very lucky to have a husband who cooks, for a start. It's a good partnership. I met him through a friend, and we just hit it off.","I don't have any rules when it comes to clothes. I'll wear anything if it fits and looks good.","I inherited my weight problem from my mum. She was always on diets. If there was a box of chocolates in the house, she'd eat half a chocolate, then put the other half back. She loved me, but she did encourage me to diet in my teens.","For many years, I picked the wrong men, or they picked me. I think if you don't feel attractive or worth something as a woman, you attract men who don't really look after you. That's what happened to me, but I realise that those relationships were like a journey, helping me to learn something about myself.","I get invited to a lot more glamorous parties since I've been in 'Downton Abbey,' which has made me much more fashion conscious.","I want to have a scene with Maggie Smith.","I quite like L.A.","I'm not very good with conventional, prim-and-proper people who are well-behaved, grown-up.","My husband is a martial artist, and he thinks it's hilarious that I have a stage-fighting-proficiency certificate. He thinks that's ridiculous. Can't say I've used it much.","I believe anything can happen.","I go dog-walking a lot.","People I've never spoken to before come up to me and give me a hug.","I'm an ambassador for Medical Detection dogs.","When I heard I had gotten 'Downton Abbey,' I remember I was standing on a freezing cold street in Manchester where we were shooting the Manchester part of 'West is West.'","I guess that is my favorite thing - to make people laugh and also to maybe engage them emotionally and touch them somehow in telling the story.","I've not cooked Christmas dinner since 1982.","Coming eyeball to eyeball with a hummingbird on my terrace is as exciting to me as any celebrity I've met as a result of 'Downton Abbey.'","'Sweeney Todd' is my favorite Sondheim musical.","I was painfully shy as a child.","I never imagined I'd go into acting, but I always loved drama, and when I was 16, I discovered the Library Theatre up the road. So I plucked up courage and asked if I could watch rehearsals. It was like Heaven.","The first time I ever got up on a stage, I did a comedy poem. I don't know how I got there in the first place because I was very, very shy.","I sometimes wonder what it would have been like if I'd got 'Downton Abbey' when I was 22.","When you look back, I think things are as they are meant to be. Timing is very important.","The first role I played was Madame Ranevsky in 'The Cherry Orchard.'","Visiting a show that's already established can be a bit daunting, as they've been a family already, and you're the newbie.","I always admire people who have passion.","I wish I could play the piano. I started when I was four and finished when I was five. I got bored. I couldn't tell my left hand from my right back then!","For years, I've felt that there's an inner cook in me just waiting to be unleashed. But I have to confess I'm having an awful lot of trouble finding her in real life.","I did an O-level in domestic science when I was at school, but on the day of the practical exam, it was a cookery nightmare.","My poor cooking is legendary among my friends.","I know it sounds funny, but every time I have a disaster in the kitchen, it knocks my confidence level a little bit more, and I feel annoyed with myself that I can't do better."],"Lesley Stahl":["I don't know of anybody's political bias at CBS News. We try very hard to get any opinion that we have out of our stories, and most of our stories are balanced.","I can't tell people what flag to fly.","I thought administration was the running of the office. The Xerox machine. Paying bills."],"Lesley Visser":["I don't know if everybody is ready to hear a woman tell them so-and-so is going to run off left tackle. But you know what? They're going to hear it.","Guys do not have a genetic blueprint that allows them to understand or love sports.","My schedule has slowed a little. I've cut back on some of my assignments. But I still have the enthusiasm for the sports world that I had 38 years ago.","I'm proud of my status as a pioneer in this business.","For years, I stored my sweaters in the oven.","Everything is working.","All the cameras shifted from the players to me.","I went to the top of the Cotton Bowl by myself, sat down and cried.","What kept me going through all the years? More than anything, the love of and respect for competition. That's what it comes down to for me. That's why I do this.","That I've lasted is one of my greatest accomplishments. Maybe my greatest."],"Lesley-Anne Down":["The curtains would open and it would be just her standing in some ludicrous pose, like Aphrodite.","I personally don't have a problem with naked bodies on television.","It wasn't sexual in its element. I wasn't being exploited. I was doing what happened. It was very challenging because I played Phyllis from 15 years old to 53 when she died of breast cancer.","We've all listened to Dr. Laura Schlessinger, haven't we? We all know how not to play a psychiatrist.","That Days of Our Lives thing for a week nearly killed me.","When I get to my deathbed, I don't want to take my last breath and say, Well, how glorious. I've left the world my acting credits. I won't even think that."],"Lesli Linka Glatter":["I was born in Dallas, and I grew up both there and in New York City, which was very schizophrenic.","When I went into film, it never occurred to me that I wouldn't be able to do whatever I wanted to do. Maybe that was a good thing in the beginning. I had blinders on, and I charged forward.","One of my first episodic jobs was on 'Twin Peaks,' if you can imagine that - one of the most unusual series ever.","I like to really know what every scene is about, what the text is, what the subtext is. Then I figure out how to express that when I'm shooting.","Like any director working today, I started out when somebody took a shot at hiring me. It's how we all start out - male, female, white or minority.","As somebody who has been an executive producer on a television series, I can tell you that increasing director diversity is as simple as hiring more women and more people of color.","We've heard the excuses from those responsible for hiring that they don't want to take a chance on a new director. But the truth is that the industry hires new directors all the time; it's just that most of them are white males.","Sometimes there are no good choices.","Demi Moore is an extremely sexy woman. Melanie Griffith, Annette Bening - these are all brave women. They've all managed to have kids and still be sexy. If anything, being a mom makes them even sexier.","My background is in modern dance. I was a dancer and a choreographer before I was a director, and in dance, you can't cheat. Your leg goes up in the air, or it doesn't. So when I direct, I'm a big preparer.","I don't ever want to impose something on the story. I want the story to tell me.","When you're working in a collaborative storytelling medium, every step of the way, you're opening yourself up.","Every creator sets up their world differently. That's what's so amazing about someone like Aaron Sorkin and his writing.","The characters, to me, in 'Homeland' are not one note in any way.","On various shows, I've been the producing-director, the executive producer-director; and if you were working with the material you love with the right group of people, it's an incredible job to be doing.","Trust the material; trust the story that you're telling.","America had the message of freedom and democracy, but we haven't actually shown that to be what we do in the world. So I think that's a terrifying thing.","Film schools are now nearly 50-50 male-female, and women are also well represented at festivals and in indie film. But what happens to them after they direct their first film or short? Where do they go? They certainly aren't being given the same opportunities as their male counterparts.","We often hear of a male director directing a great indie and immediately being offered the next huge comic book movie. Rarely, if ever, does this happen to a woman.","I have been helped over and over by wonderful men and women in my career. Men help each other all the time, and that kind of inclusion among women can create similar success.","To anyone in the position to hire women directors: Make the commitment."],"Leslie Banks":["In all honesty, at that time, I never saw myself as an author... I was just a Mom in a state of panic, trying to enter a short story contest to win the prize money in order to keep the lights on in my home.","The story grew, got way bigger than the contest rules called for, and next thing I knew I had a book.","It was all a back-handed blessing, and my friends were the ones who kept the faith, read my work, and urged me to submit it to publishers (by sending it out for me - they would not hear no for an answer.","I look at life, the experiences I've had, at the human condition, the dynamics between people, the news (world news), and draw from the compelling realities all around us.","I love the paranormal, because there, every genre I write can become one beacon for my imagination.","That has always been it for me: family first."],"Leslie Bibb":["There is something that feels stagnant about having things you don't use or wear. But shoes are my thing. Shoes and scarves, I'm a big fan of the scarf.","People get DUIs, people get in fights with their boyfriends, it happens, life happens, but it's about being accountable for your actions. I don't know. I'm just not that girl, I don't go to clubs. I'm a pretty normal girl.","I never think, Oh, I'm so beautiful. To me, feeling happy is more important.","I do have body-image issues, just like everyone else. I mean, I wish I had bigger boobs. And I hate my butt. I want an onion butt - you know, a butt that'll bring tears to your eyes?","I felt like the big geek in high school. And I still feel like a big geek.","I hate being a blonde.","I've had some styles that make me wonder what the hell I was thinking. How did I let someone do that to me?","My friends tease me because I don't like clutter. I'm not someone who gets attached to things.","Listen, if you said to me, 'Adam Shankman is going to direct you in a musical and you have six months to learn how to tap,' I'd practice till I was blue in the face. I would do it because I'm so headstrong and think I can do anything. But just to show up and sing a little ditty, no.","Women have that weird way of trying to be feminist. You know, like 'hear me roar.' But what they really want is a man to open the door for them.","I like day dates. On night dates, you just go somewhere and start drinking. But if you really want to see if a girl is worth your time, go to a museum or for coffee.","I'm not a 'Steel Magnolias' kind of girl. I'm kind of like a guy. My favorite movie is 'Caddyshack.'","I feel like if you're a girl in the South, you know 'Gone with the Wind' better than anything. Scarlett O'Hara is such a quintessential Southern woman.","My dad died when I was three so my mom had to raise four kids on her own, and I think there's a part of me that pulls upon having watched my mom do that our whole lives. She had to make it work."],"Leslie Bricusse":["I'm musical in the sense that I can write a song, but I realised when I was learning the piano as a child that there were people who played it so much better.","When I write a song, I hear the music and words at the same time - one suggests the form of the other.","When I wake up, if I can't figure something out during the daytime and then wake up at 4 A.M., it's there immediately. I don't know if it's the subconscious mind working, but it just happens.","If you can't get a word at first, it's always waiting somewhere, and it's just a case of finding it.","As a complete score, I love 'Sherlock Holmes' - but we cast it badly. We put Ron Moody into the part - a great Fagin, not a great Sherlock Holmes.","I wanted to grow up to be George and Ira Gershwin from the age of about six.","It takes a while to get a show on, and I've a number that have not yet been produced. I want to see all of them produced spectacularly before I pack it in.","When you live in a world of imagination, your imagination doesn't necessarily grow old with you.","I think we have to assume we have one life. Though, having said that, I did write a song called 'You Only Live Twice.' I'll settle for that.","I don't believe in giving in to old age.","Writing songs and lyrics is not that different from doing the 'Times' crossword every morning. They both give you a good mental workout.","My view is that the great songwriting happened between 1920 and 1960. We're all, in our different ways, descended from the great songwriters of that era.","'Retirement' is a dirty word. Luckily, I can carry on working until I drop, provided I retain my mental abilities.","I never try to predict what will happen to any project, ever. There are so many factors. Does the public like the subject matter, the way you handle it?","I was talking to a TV bigwig, and he said, 'Nobody under 35 knows who Sammy Davis is.' Well, you'll hear angry denials of that from younger people.","The film musical is a very strange animal. They can bite you in the back, or they can do very well for you.","I fell in love with the idea of writing songs when I was a child. I thought I was going to be a journalist at first, but I gradually fell in love with all these great writers like Irving Berlin and Cole Porter, who were at the peak of their powers then.","It's much easier to write a song for a musical than just writing a song because, writing for a musical, you know what the story is about, so you know what the songs have got to say.","I think 'Scrooge' is the best of the Christmas stories. Every child warms to it because it's about one man's transformation. It's saying that it's never too late to change, and that's a good feeling to have at Christmas."],"Leslie Caron":["In order to have great happiness you have to have great pain and unhappiness - otherwise how would you know when you're happy?","It's very difficult to marry into another civilization.","I think it's the end of progress if you stand still and think of what you've done in the past. I keep on.","I know a lot of Americans in Paris who have married Frenchmen. They keep bringing up their experience, the clash of civilizations, the clash of personalities.","James Ivory comes close to the actors for the first rehearsal. He more or less lets you direct yourself and then will only correct you if he finds it incorrect.","It's the first film that I made where the director was not present under the camera, and it threw me.","The American is wholeheartedly for love and romance at any cost.","I was trying to be very at ease in this arrogant person, and very worldly, but something human came into the part. I hate to say that. I wanted to be totally worldly.","No matter what you do, your person comes through. You can't completely change yourself on the screen. I had in mind someone colder and more in control, but I couldn't do it. This human note just crept in and maybe it's better.","I hate biographies which say, I was called to such and such an office, and he offered me so and so, and I got so and so money. I find that very tedious. The best biographies are written by other people.","I toured the Middle Eastern countries with the ballet.","Fred Astaire was a more formal, trained dancer who loved waltzing and only danced with the girls.","We were all ruled by the studio system. I signed a contract for seven years.","I got as little as a $75 a week when I started.","The studio system collapsed only when Elizabeth Taylor charged $1 million for Cleopatra.","There were many good actresses in my time like Jane Powell and Debbie Reynolds, but I was the only dancer.","I longed to break out of the system and do different roles.","When I did small films like Lily and Buenos Vista, everyone thought my career would be ruined.","I regret not doing a film that I was offered with Clark Gable because the script was not good enough.","I seemed to belong to three countries: I had an apartment in Paris, a house in Hollywood, and when I married British theater director Peter Hall, I moved to London.","I had two children. I had a nanny to manage my kids.","You have actresses like Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts, who have roles specially written for them.","Cinema will always have an important role to play in society.","The most important thing is to remain active and to love what you are doing.","I went to the Tokyo Film Festival in Japan because I love Japanese cinema.","I went to Kerala in India, to learn Ayurveda, which was fantastic."],"Leslie Charteris":["It should cause no surprise that anyone so lazy as myself should be economical to the point of miserliness with everything he writes.","For there is a price ticket on everything that puts a whizz into life, and adventure follows the rule. It's distressing, but there you are.","The gleam in their eyes telegraphs only too clearly that they are hoping for a headline, which of course means something disparaging, because nothing makes such good copy as a feud.","The reason is that for many years I have avoided reading anything whatsoever that approaches my own line of country, out of a somewhat fanatical desire to avoid the risk of unconscious imitation.","I had still never read one of the Bond books when the movie Dr. No came out.","In 1938, when I had decided that the only way to see the country was in a trailer, and I built the trailer which I still have and lived in it for eighteen months, and learned America from San Diego to the Canadian border, from Miami to New Jersey, and east to west in between.","In 1939 I hadn't even realized that this was an immigration problem.","Everything I write is designed to be milked to the last drop of revenue.","If I didn't see its place in the Saga when I planned it, I probably wouldn't write it at all.","Others, amounting to four novels and a mess of short stories which I did not think worth preserving, I have done my best to eliminate from the record by refusing all requests for permission to reprint them, and I hope I have done a good job of making them hard to unearth.","About the Saint's amorous adventures, by the way, I can't speak so brazenly.","He believes in romance. He isn't merely going through the mechanical movements of a man in an exciting situation. He is, vitally and positively squeezing the last drop of delight from living the best life he knows in the best way he can."],"Leslie Cockburn":["When you have a situation that's destructive, when there's tremendous inhumanity everywhere, you see how humanity survives in all of its different permutations.","When you are on assignment, you stick to the facts, limit your vision, and often cut out the most revealing material. There is no texture, no shades of gray. In fiction, you can bring the reader on the perilous journey with your characters as they discover that war is more like a wilderness of mirrors, full of danger and uncertainty.","I covered the first Gulf War in Saudi Arabia and Israel for ABC News.","After reading Graham Greene and Joseph Conrad when I was a student at Yale, I wanted to live in the world they captured in their books. I had had some experience living in Africa. I was drawn to that kind of adventure.","Journalism, for me, has always been a calling. There are things that must be exposed to the light, truths that must be uncovered, stories worth risking your life for.","I started making little films with a 16 mm camera as an undergraduate at Yale. My first job out of college was 'assistant editor' on a forgettable low budget feature.","When I was at graduate school in London, I began working at NBC News, which had a thriving documentary unit.","In documentary films, the most difficult thing to achieve is to make something complex appear simple.","When you do a piece of journalism, you may have to cut away 95 percent of what you are experiencing.","When I was in London at NBC, I was the lowest man on the totem pole. I would go to diplomatic receptions to meet people.","I have a great spouse, Andrew Cockburn, who's also a journalist.","I think the greatest thing about making a documentary is your ability to just follow the story and the subject.","It's a very enclosed world on Wall Street."],"Leslie Dewan":["A nuclear power reactor is just a fancy way of boiling water.","Nuclear power is a young technology - there's so much more to be discovered. That's what makes it so exciting to me. Yes, there are problems, but innovative people are going to be able to come up with solutions and bring the technology to its full potential.","I've always been concerned about global warming. It seemed to me like working in nuclear power was a logical way to do something to help the environment.","I've always thought of nuclear as something that's good for the environment. I worry about my polar bears.","If you want to bring change to any field, beat away at a problem until you solve it.","Ever since I was little, I've always had a few science experiments going on."],"Leslie Easterbrook":["I have fans all around the world.","When I first started acting, I started in opera and had a great desire to play grand, tragic characters. I got sidetracked in musical theater and ended up doing a lot of comedy.","Mother Firefly is the kind of character I've always wanted to play. She's larger than life, terribly tragic, and capable of a lot of love.","I can be inappropriate at times.","I did a film once that I was killed in. It was a painful, horrifying day. It was a wonderful day from the standpoint of acting, but I was a wreck otherwise.","I wish I had a funny story.","I'm a big taco fan."],"Leslie Fiedler":["I long for the raised voice, the howl of rage or love.","There are things in American culture that want to wipe the class distinction. Blue jeans. Ready-made clothes. Coca-Cola.","Faulkner sat in our living room and read from Light in August. That was incredible.","All good criticism should be judged the way art is. You shouldn't read it the way you read history or science.","I love it now that a large minority of people who are handicapped prefer to call themselves crippled. This is all part of the game, like queer theory.","Of the female black authors, I really like Morrison's early books a lot. But she's really become so much a clone of Faulkner. He did it better.","I like that people who are not experts can not only understand but get engaged by my work. I like that Joe Paterno can read me. Bill Bradley.","Anybody in the next centuries wanting to know what it was like to be a poet in the middle of the 20th century should read Kaddish.","Cooper wrote a novel which is absolutely indistinguishable from Austen, completely from a female point of view, completely English, no sense that he was an American.","Critics? How do they happen? I know how it happened to me. I would send a poem or story to a magazine and they would say this doesn't suit our needs precisely but on the other hand you sound interesting. Would you be interested in doing a review?","DeLillo never seems committed to me to what he is writing. Very nice surfaces, but he's got nothing underneath.","Faulkner turned out to be a great teacher. When a student asked a question ineptly, he answered the question with what the student had really wanted to know.","Foucault was the one person I met in France that I could talk to. He was a mensch. You know whether you agree with him or not because you know what he is saying.","Gertrude Stein really thought of Hemingway as frail. He almost married Stein.","Hemingway seems to be in a funny position. People nowadays can't identify with him closely as a member of their own generation, and he isn't yet historical.","Henry Miller wrote novels, but he calls his protagonist Henry, often Henry Miller, and his books are in this gray area between memoir and novel.","I admire Ginsberg as a poet, despite the fact that he seems not to know when he is being good and when he is bad. But he will last, or at least those poems will last.","I gave up writing blurbs because you make one friend and 200 enemies.","I have, I admit, a low tolerance for detached chronicling and cool analysis.","I liked Camille Paglia. I liked her even better when I heard her talk.","I never met anybody in my life who says, I want to be a critic. People want to be a fireman, poet, novelist.","I think Henry Miller has had huge influence not because he wrote about sex, but because the memoir or the nonfiction novel has become such a monumental force in American publishing, if not in literature.","I think the pattern of my essays is, A funny thing happened to me on my way through Finnegans Wake.","I used to be fond of Indian arm wrestling.","I've been writing about James Fenimore Cooper. He was not a writer. Here was a man who was 30 years old and had never put anything more than his signature on paper.","I've had a tough time with Pynchon. I liked him very much when I first read him. I liked him less with each book. He got denser and more complex in a way that didn't really pay off.","If there's one thing I can't stand, it's somebody doing something because I pushed them in that direction.","It's funny to be a critic.","It's so wrong when I pick up a new edition of Huckleberry Finn and I look at the last page and it doesn't say, Yours truly, at the end.","Jane Austen is at the end of the line that begins with Samuel Richardson, which takes wonder and magic out of the novel, treats not the past but the present.","Kafka is still unrecognized. He thought he was a comic writer.","My assignment is what every writer's assignment is: tell the truth of his own time.","One more recent novelist to come along is Cormac McCarthy. Him, I like.","Raymond Carver is good. I think he'll be appreciated more and more. He's an easy writer to imitate.","Saul Bellow never took my advice when he was my friend.","The black situation has changed. They finally realized they're Americans.","The middlebrow, I hate.","The novel doesn't come into existence until certain methods of reproducing fiction come along.","The novel is always pop art, and the novel is always dying. That's the only way it stays alive. It does really die. I've been thinking about that a lot.","The novel is the first art form that is an honest-to-god commodity. That's what makes it different from both high art and folk art.","The reason Saul Bellow doesn't talk to me anymore is because he knows his new novels are not worth reading.","What I really dream of is that somebody would blow everything I've done out of the water in a beautiful way, which would clear the way for something better to come along.","When all of us are forgotten, people will still be remembering Stephen King.","When I was 12 years old, someone took me to see Martha Graham. It was nothing like what I thought of as serious dancing and even then I knew I was having a great experience. It was as if somebody was moving through space like no one ever did before.","When somebody asks me what I do, I don't think I'd say critic. I say writer.","Writers always know whether you like them or not."],"Leslie Hope":["There are really only two things I'm terrified of: water and cockroaches.","I was in a university prep school in Canada, and the way that particular place worked was, you chose at a very young age what you were going to do with the rest of your life. Mine was law.","I was very aware that my path into the industry would probably be as an actress and not in production, that I could learn a lot that way. And I did.","I don't know so much about making it, because I think of myself as a working actor who's always got my eye on what's going to be the next job. I've been acting for 22 years, and I think there's something to be said for simply staying in the game.","When I got off '24,' pretty soon after that I did a movie that took place in the '70s, this movie with Jimmy Caan and Gena Rowlands, and I needed to kind of have that '70s pouffy housewife hair.","Everything I know about the FBI came from movies! Right? The idea of these kind of uptight, conservative guys whose ties are tied too tight.","I ate ants. They weren't that bad.","At the age of 16, I decided to rebel and become an actress. I wasn't happy with rules and regulations."],"Leslie Howard":["Don't think I am not homesick for America. I say 'homesick' advisedly because I am a man with two homes - America, which gave me hospitality for many happy years, and where my daughter was born; and my native England.","I can't think of anything more exciting than trying to be an actor.","What the actor is in private life, he is to a large extent on the stage, because he cannot conceal himself and his true personality from his audience.","The truth is that to enjoy acting one must be an exhibitionist at heart, one must revel in those exposures of the emotions which would be agonizing to a shy or reserved person. All the great actors have been and are exhibitionists."],"Leslie Jamison":["The global phenomenon of poverty tourism - or 'poorism' - has become increasingly popular during the past few years. Tourists pay to be guided through the favelas of Brazil and the shantytowns of South Africa. The recently opened Los Angeles Gang Tour carries visitors through battle-scarred territories of urban violence and deprivation.","You pass the old L.A. County jail, which is surprisingly beautiful. It's got a handsome stone facade and stately columns. The new L.A. County jail - called The Twin Towers - isn't beautiful at all; it's a stucco panopticon the color of sick flesh.","The 'here' of Watts is pastel houses with window gratings in curly patterns. 'Here' is yard sales with bins full of stuffed animals and used water guns. Here is Crips turf.","Redeeming subjects from cliche is its own pleasure and privilege.","I've been lucky enough to work with extraordinary teachers along the way, and I'm excited to share what I've learned with graduate students at SNHU. I'm just as excited for what I'll learn from them.","Whenever I've been stuck on a project, it's always brought me solace to the return to books that moved me in the past. It's a nice way to get outside my own head; and it brings me back to one of the most important reasons I write at all: to bring some pleasure to readers, to make them think or feel.","After finishing a draft, no matter how rough, I almost always put it aside for a while. It doesn't matter if it's a story or a novel, I find that when it's still fresh in my mind I'm either thoroughly sick of its flaws or completely blind to them. Either way, I'm unable to make substantive edits of any value.","It's one of the most liberating things I experience in writing - letting yourself get rid of a gesture or character or plot point that always nagged, even if you couldn't admit to yourself that it did.","The publishing industry, unsurprisingly, is full of different people who love different things and express that love in different languages. Find the people, the editors and agents, with whom you share some language, and some sense of what makes literature worth reading.","Armchair poverty tourism has been around as long as authors have written about class. As an author, I have struggled myself with the nuances of writing about poverty without reducing any community to a catalog of its difficulties.","Though there might not be any easy answers to the problem of poverty, its most compelling scribes do not resign themselves to representation solely for the sake of those age-old verities of truth and beauty.","I can't remember a time when I wasn't trying to figure out what to say at the dinner table.","It's kind of funny that I've been branded as the empathy lady when, really, what I'm doing is questioning and interrogating empathy.","'Tough' is one of the last adjectives I would use to describe myself.","The story of getting better can be just as compelling as the story of falling apart.","I had never really thought of myself as a baby person, but it's just a really profound connection.","I feel like I have a bit of a Type A personality.","I do like arranging things. I like order. I basically like all these things that are the opposite of what people associate with the wild, passionate creative temperament.","I completely identify with finding freedom in boundaries. That's why I tend to have more freedom when I write nonfiction over fiction: because I'm running up against actuality and beholden to the truth in a different way.","One of the big ways in which I felt my own writing life shaped by recovery had to do with my relationship to other people's stories. And one of the things I loved most about recovery was the way in which, in meetings and through fellowship, you are constantly kind of paying attention to lives outside of your own.","I really believe in people putting stories out there that contain the most difficult moments because nothing to me is more lonely making than sanitized stories or airbrushed stories that kind of allied how hard it got.","Somebody once asked me how I define sobriety, and my response was 'liberation from dependence.'","There's something about that puritanical narrative of progress and upward mobility and work ethic that the glorification of abstinence fits pretty neatly into. That pairs with the fact that 12-step recovery has had too large a monopoly on how treatment is understood in America.","12-step recovery is very focused on abstinence, and that's bled into the broader understanding of treatment. It would be most useful to have multiple senses of what treatment could look like.","My dad is an economist who does global development research. What he practices is a kind of quantifiable empathy: trying to empathize with systems rather than people.","If you operate under the premise that everybody already has some experiences that could be sources of empathy for them, I wonder if there's some process of coaxing people into tapping into that knowledge.","Shame doesn't exist as an emotion without the projected or perceived sense of judgment coming from somewhere else.","Whenever we feel shame, it's a mark of some deep investment or deep internal struggle.","I used to believe that hurting would make you more alive to the hurting of others. I used to believe in feeling bad because somebody else did. Now I'm not so sure of either.","I don't make films, and because I don't make films, I'm not an expert in the craft of bringing a film into the world, how you put its various pieces together. But where I feel like I'm an expert is my own feelings in response to a film.","Probably every person is some mixture of wanting to feel a sense of commonality and shared experience with others but also wanting to feel completely singular and unique.","When you're a writer and something difficult happens to you, one of the things involved in that is this emergence of narrative potential. And there's then a kind of self-consciousness about telling a story in which you suffered.","Difficulty is our most reliable narrative engine.","The idea that a story has to be 'exceptional' in order to be worth telling is curious to me. What if we looked at every single person's story as a site of possibly infinite meaning? What if we came to believe that there isn't hubris or narcissism in thinking your story might be worth sharing - only a sense of curiosity and offering?","It's not just that everyone has a story. It's that everyone has a thousand stories. Everyone is infinite."],"Leslie Jones":["As soon as I touched the mic, I knew that's what I would do for the rest of my life.","Hate speech and freedom of speech are two different things.","Unfortunately, I'm used to the insults.","I honestly believe that people sit behind their computers and just get really brave.","Why is being a woman so surprising? There are two sexes. A man and a woman. So, if it's not a man in a movie, what else was it going to be?","I'm really good at standup. I always win at standup.","When you're writing a sketch, it has to be surrounded by a situation. It can't just be out of the air.","My job is to bring the tickle. I know what's funny.","I take care of everybody. I'm either hugging you or making sure that you're not sick, because my backpack has every kind of medicine in it.","I had all the intentions of being the next Eddie Murphy.","I met the CEO of Twitter.","It takes a real designer to design for real women.","I've been six feet tall since the sixth grade.","It was always hard for me to find clothes.","The big percentage is us, the real people, and we have to say something. You have to speak up. You have to.","I know who I am.","There was a time where I knew I was as funny as many dudes, but I had people telling me, 'You have to wear a dress onstage. You need to be more feminine.'","When my brother passed away... I made a decision that I might die soon, and if I die, I want people to know who I really am.","Think about back in the day when we had Archie Bunker, 'The Jeffersons.' We had stuff to sit down and share and laugh at. The Internet has made it so we don't have to sit together anymore. It's so self-absorbed. No one has to talk to each other anymore, and people don't realize that that is killing us.","I love the people at my job. I love my boss. I love my camera men, I love my crew - because they all surrounded me with straight love.","I've perfected the art of busting on people. That's how comedians show each other love.","Every black comedian in the country knew what I could do. But that doesn't mean everyone else is paying attention.","I know I'm fly - don't get me wrong. But I don't look, like, standard Hollywood. As a comedian, it's something you learn to use.","You know what makes me mad about 'The Bachelorette?' That, you know, that that chick would get a man. Get me a date.","I get real brave when I text people. When I text people, I am so brave because it's words, but you can't say stuff.","You can look good. Don't let nobody tell you you can't look good because of your size... or what size your feet is.","People used to call me names, so my mom had this beautiful African lady come talk to me.","When I was young, my dad always let me listen to comedy albums.","I always knew about comedy; I always loved comedy.","The day that I saw Whoopi Goldberg on television, I cried so hard because I kept looking at my daddy going, 'Oh my God. There's somebody on TV that looks like me! She looks like me! Yay! I can be on TV! I can be on TV! I can do it! Look at her - look at her! She looks just like me.'","I just knew that I was funny, and I knew that it was just a matter of time. I didn't know what was going to actually happen - this is definitely way bigger than I thought - but I knew there was no way I was going to be that funny, and nobody was going to notice it.","I would never quit comedy to make money. I've been doing it, like, 30 years. I still love it. That's my life.","I'm glad this whole success thing is happening now. I can't even imagine a 23-year-old Leslie in this position.","Bill Murray was just so funny to me - there wasn't anything spooking him.","They redid 'Roots,' and everyone was saying, 'Oh, it shouldn't have been done.' I was like, 'It definitely should have been done.' Because it needs to be refurbished for the new generation so they can understand it.","When we did this reboot, I thought 'Ghostbusters' fans would be so excited: 'They've got the new technology - the ghosts are going to look real now.'","I can't be intimidated by anyone wearing a housecoat.","I did not leave Twitter."],"Leslie Mann":["Women love hairy men. Cavemen were the sexiest men in history.","I've always surrounded myself with funny people.","I don't take anything at face value. I always look for the reasons people are the way they are.","Perfect people are the scariest people to me.","I have lunches with my girlfriends, who just turned 40, and some of those lunches, we're crying and screaming about our husbands, saying we want to leave them and run away. And then, other lunches, we're fine and love our husbands and are happy with our lives.","When I was 9, my parents let me take a cab to the mall all by myself. I had hardly any money to spend, but I did have a very specific list of things I wanted to do: buy cookies and sit on the furniture at Sears.","I'd never want to go back to being in my twenties or thirties. I was lost and confused and uncomfortable in my own skin.","I feel very protective of younger actresses, because it was so hard for me in the business.","Auditioning is so nerve-racking.","I'm pretty much game for anything.","My mother married three times. My dad is... I don't really have one. I mean, he does exist, but I have zero relationship with him.","I didn't think, 'I want to do dramas or I want to do comedies' - I wasn't clear in that way.","I've always been intrigued by the supernatural.","I bring a poofy gray down jacket with me wherever I go. It's meant for winter, but I use it most in the summer, when everyone cranks up the air-conditioning.","I'm terrified by speaking in front of people!","I like dark humor. My favorite movie of all time is 'Harold and Maude.'","I like more grounded comedy. I enjoy broad comedies also, but I like Shirley MacLaine.","When I started auditioning, I'd take any audition I could get. The more dramatic ones didn't go as well as the comedic.","I don't understand why people think it's harder to do drama than it is to do comedy.","Along with age comes more confidence, so it kind of works out.","Men. We love them. We respect them. But we rarely get to objectify them.","Megan Fox is so funny.","Don't assume I have everything figured out... I get as confused about life as everybody, and sometimes I think I'm just hurtling through the world without a plan at all.","Sixteen is a hard time. A lot of kids are experimenting with things.","I'm very comfortable when I'm working; I don't hold back at all.","Everything is so chaotic. My nervous system can't handle it. I need my peace, so, every once in a while, while the kids are at school, I lie in bed, close the curtains, watch television and eat food.","I feel like I could be good at directing or producing, but I don't know.","I'm not willing to spend too much time away from my kids, so I usually don't work that much.","Once a month, I get together with my girlfriends and we usually check into a hotel or go to someone else's house. We can talk for 15 hours, and it just flies by.","When you have little kids, you lose friends because you're so busy, but as they get older, you realise how important it is to have your girlfriends around.","I like being married to someone who does what I do, and we can talk for hours about all of this stuff that I struggle with and all this stuff that he struggles with because we're struggling with the same things. If I was married to a banker, I don't know what we'd talk about.","Child actors don't have great track records.","Growing up, I wasn't as comfortable expressing myself as I am now, and I think that's why I chose acting: because it's acceptable to have your feelings. It's a place that they want you to feel. Whereas in life, growing up, it was 'Be quiet!' and 'Keep it to yourself.'","My favourite movie is 'Terms of Endearment.'","I honestly don't know where the high voice thing came from in the first place. Why do people have high voices? Emotional problems? What is that? It could easily be that. And now I'm getting more normal, and my voice is getting deeper.","I'm so sick of seeing these movies where married couples are just cuddling on the couch and caressing each other's faces.","I never felt comfortable leaving my kids until they were older. When they were babies, I remember thinking that I could never go on a Jerry Bruckheimer set and feel comfortable.","I didn't think I was a humorless shrew in 'Knocked Up.' I think the women are just as funny as the men are in that movie.","There aren't good roles for women: the female parts aren't developed: the women are serving the men.","All the things you put off, like learning to play the piano or leaning a different language? You're like, what's the point? I'm not really gonna do that, am I?","Basically, I just want to do a movie where I'm surrounded by women.","I'm not really interested in doing a traditional romantic comedy where everything ties up neatly.","Women do not like CDs of live music. We only like the original recordings. If a song sounds different from the version we fell in love with, then it's awful.","I tried to kickbox once right after I had my first baby, and I was so miserable; it was so hard. And I went home, and I passed out for three hours because it's so hard.","I don't quite fit in in like a pure dramatic thing, but I still think of myself sometimes as sort of a dramatic actress.","I was teased relentlessly when I was a kid about my voice, so it's kind of nice that now I'm making a lot of money with it.","They say that when a woman wants to end a relationship, she cuts off all of her hair. I've done that twice in my marriage but am still married.","It's always fun to think about winning an award. I thought about winning awards when I was a little girl. Everybody wants to win an award for something.","You have nothing to offer if you're just some machine actress.","I've known my two best girlfriends since junior high school."],"Leslie Marmon Silko":["Writing can't change the world overnight, but writing may have an enormous effect over time, over the long haul.","Time limits are fictional. Losing all sense of time is actually the way to reality. We use clocks and calendars for convenience sake, not because that kind of time is real.","I write in order to find out what I truly know and how I really feel about certain things. Writing requires me to go much deeper into my thoughts and memories than conversation does. Writing provides the solitude necessary to reflect on being in this world.","To be able to make up stories has been a great gift to me from my ancestors and from the storytellers who were so numerous at Laguna Pueblo when I was growing up. I learned to read as soon as I could because I wanted stories without having to depend on adults to tell or read stories to me."],"Leslie Moonves":["Broadcast TV is still the mothership and it will be for the foreseeable future. Audiences may be declining slightly but revenues are going up and profits are going up.","I take great pride in all the tremendous success we've enjoyed at CBS. And the good news is that I feel even more enthusiastic about what my terrific team and I will accomplish going forward.","It is too soon to tell, but old, tired 'Survivor' last night beat 'X Factor.' We're really proud of that. We're anticipating a very strong season for CBS.","Ultimately journalism has changed... partisanship is very much a part of journalism now.","I am broadcaster's biggest cheerleader because I genuinely believe in it. Where else can you get 20 million people a week watching 'NCIS' or 'American Idol?' Where else can you get 120 million watching the Super Bowl?","Broadcasting for advertisers is still the best game in town, and they know it. Look, I admire a lot of the shows on cable. I think 'Mad Men' is wonderful. I think 'Breaking Bad' is wonderful. But let's remember they're about one-tenth the audience of NCIS.","You won't see Moonves on Twitter.","The stories about broadcast dying or it being overtaken by cable have stopped. Same goes for the stories about the Internet hurting our business.","We realize that if we live in a world that depends totally on CBS.com, we'd be dead.","We have CBS.com, we have our stuff on iTunes. We feel the wave of the future is getting as much distribution as we can. We feel that we should be nonexclusive and get our content out there.","I read the papers, I surf the Web. At the beginning of the year, I try to see at least two episodes of every show on our network. Am I surfing? All the time. I'm aware of the landscape. I'm a competitor, so I have to know whom I'm competing with.","CBS is the largest out-of-home advertising company in the U.S.","News, by and large, has been the purest of all the television mediums, or at least we've tried to keep it that way, and there constantly is the argument about the separation between church and state.","By the same token, I think news has more and more of a pro bono aspect to all the networks. When we do our election coverages throughout this coming year, it's not a money-maker for us. It is more of a public service situation.","As the TiVos and the Replays are coming into our world - and they're coming - it's better to - be inside the tent and figure out what they're doing and to work hand in hand with them as opposed to saying, 'You know what, the automobile is not going to work. I'm going to stick to my horse and carriage,' you know.","I was one of the first to read the 'ER' script and the good news is George Clooney still gives me credit for helping to launch his career. I had George Clooney under contract for four years in a row before 'ER' happened. He's one of the few who remembers the people who helped him.","I think many years from now, people will still watch television, though it will probably be 150 inches wide. What will change is the ability to get 'CSI' not only on TV but also on the Internet, even watching it in a foreign country as it's playing in the U.S.","There are plenty of people who are willing to pay $2.6 million for 30 seconds on the Super Bowl and hundreds of thousands of dollars for 'American Idol.' There will be advertising dollars on the Internet. We're there as well. We win either way.","My wife is the host of 'Big Brother.' Her name is Julie Chen, and she'll say, 'Da da da, but first we do this.' So they mashed together her saying 'but first' a couple dozen times. Literally. In different outfits. And when you cut it together like that, it appears very robotlike. They called her the Chenbot.","We think wireless is going to grow tremendously. Do I think people are going to watch an episode of 'Survivor' on a 2-inch television set? I doubt it. But I do think somebody's going to go to a grocery store in the middle of a football game and watch that game.","CBS is proud to have been the home of David Letterman since 1993. He is truly one of the great talents of our time, and we hope things work out.","I understand why creative people like dark, but American audiences don't like dark. They like story. They do not respond to nervous breakdowns and unhappy episodes that lead nowhere. They like their characters to be a part of the action. They like strength, not weakness, a chance to work out any dilemma.","Before the start of the 2000 season, 'C.S.I.' wasn't supposed to be the hit. We all thought it would be 'The Fugitive.'","Rebuilding a network is a slow, brick-by-brick process. It's not just creating a hit show - it's building shows to back up that hit show; it's creating an identity of success so that people want their shows on your network.","The reason I've been able to maintain my position of chairman of CBS in addition to all the Viacom stuff is my team."],"Leslie Morgan Steiner":["My mom is one of my role models in a complicated way. I learned from her how to be a good mom. She was one of those natural moms who really took to it. Her chosen profession was teaching. She loves kids. But she was extremely frustrated and unhappy because for much of my life she was a stay-at-home mom.","Domestic abuse happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships - in other words, in families - the last place we would want or expect to find violence.","My husband worked on Wall Street and was an Ivy League graduate as well. In our world, we were the last couple you'd imagine enmeshed in domestic violence.","Our culture encourages women to nurture men, making it predictable that many experience a seductive empathy for abusive men, as well as the misguided hope that love can obliterate an ugly past.","Family violence is a criminal act; perpetrators, while often former victims themselves, need to accept culpability.","Women are naturally competitive. That's what drives women to form cliques at early age.","Working moms elevate themselves above stay-at-home moms, and stay-at-home moms try to put down working moms. It's a war in which both sides are trying to put the other one down.","The most important experience for learning to be a mother is your own mom's experience."],"Leslie Nielsen":["I like that kind of 'straight-faced' comedy. I like to be straight-faced and outrageous.","Doing nothing is very hard to do... you never know when you're finished.","Shirley! Don't call me Shirley!","I really have to keep an eye on myself, because sometimes I think I might say something important.","I played a lot of leaders, autocratic sorts; perhaps it was my Canadian accent.","The reason they call it 'golf' is that all the other 4 letter words were used up.","The violence or the vaudeville style of comedy is a technique all by itself. You get up there, and you are a comedian, and you're doing one thing. That is, you're going to make the audience laugh.","It was a boy's name first.","There's an old saying that God exists in your search for him. I just want you to understand that I ain't looking.","The reason there's a question mark on my front door is just in case I forget my address.","I wore that same shirt yesterday playing golf. There goes the Nike account.","Yes, it's true, I've been called the Laurence Olivier of spoofs. I guess that would make Laurence Olivier the Leslie Nielsen of Shakespeare.","I have always loved science fiction. One of my favorite shows is 'Star Trek.' I like the trips, where it drops my mind off, because they give you a premise and all of a sudden, you say, 'Oh!' and I'm fascinated by it.","I had to weave and play around with a honey bear, you know, and I could wrestle with him a little bit, but there's no way you can even wrestle a honey bear, let alone a grizzly bear that's standing ten feet to eleven feet tall! Can you imagine? But it was fascinating to work that close to that kind of animal.","I've always been part of comedy. One of the things about our family was that if we were reasonably funny with each other, particularly my two brothers and myself, when my father was upset with something you'd want to make sure in some way you made him laugh. Because when he didn't laugh, you were in trouble!","You know it's very difficult to be an actor, and to have people depending on you to say the right line, at the right time, and to not be able to hear your cues! I can't tell you how many times I would've had to have said What? if I didn't have my hearing aids. So my hearing aids are a life saver, and they allow me to practice my craft.","It's not really that I've been an advocate for hearing aids for a long time, it's just that I've been losing my hearing for a long time! So it's actually very important for me because I'm actually hearing impaired and I simply want to hear better!","It's been dawning on me slowly that for the past 35 years I have been cast against type, and I'm finally getting to do what I really wanted to do.","I've finally found my home - as Lt. Frank Drebin.","There were 15 people in the village, including five of us. If my father arrested somebody in the winter, he'd have to wait until the thaw to turn him in."],"Leslie Odom, Jr.":["I'm the nap champion.","I feel like every night, when you see a really good production of 'Romeo and Juliet' or something, you should hope that it ends differently. That's why we watch our favorite movies again and again.","You gotta love this thing. Whatever you choose to pursue - medicine, law, writing, you have to love it. You study it, you eat it, you drink it, you try it, you do it, you love it in every way.","None of us wants to be judged by our worst act on our worst day, and we consistently judge Burr for that. He was not a perfect man, but he's not a villain. He's a dude, just a guy.","The only reason to keep talking about history is if you are juxtaposing it with the world that we live in today, if you are learning something about our world by looking at the way they shaped their world.","I was a good student; I was a good boy. I got A's, and I did all the papers right.","Oh, Alexander Hamilton fell short of his best self every now and again, and he still managed to do these wonderful things - well, so do I. So what am I capable of?","It is said an artist spends their whole life trying to get to the place where their heart was first opened up. 'Rent' was that place for me.","What is the future going to say about us now? What are our kids going to look at us and say, 'How could you not stop that person from getting into power? How could you not stop that environmental disaster that you saw coming a mile away?'","For most of your career, what you're trying to do is to step into other people's shoes.","Nothing lasts forever in my profession.","I've been involved with 'Hamilton' for about two and a half years. I've learned so much. I came into it a young man. Now I've dropped the 'young.'","You can't judge the people that you play anyway; you leave that for somebody else to do.","You must be an artist and a citizen of the world. You must speak to this stuff that's happening. You must do what you can to shine a light on it, help people through it.","I've realized along the way that a lot of things that I do as a performer are about waiting for somebody to write something for me or develop something for me, but music, music was the thing that I don't have to wait for anybody's permission to do.","I've been in a long-term relationship, and I'll tell you, it's never boring! People trying to merge their lives together always run into challenges.","I haven't had a chance to decorate my dressing room yet, but I have these pictures of myself as a kid that I want to put up because I said, 'I really want to make sure that I take that kid with me on this journey.' I want him to experience this.","You go see a great production of 'Romeo and Juliet,' where those kids are full of life and love, you hope and forget.","We're reminded yet again: we are stronger, we are smarter, we have more fun when we include each other - when we include as many perspectives as possible.","I studied at Carnegie Mellon. I went there with a bunch of really, really talented kids.","Josh Gad was in my class. Katy Mixon. Griffin Matthews. Josh Groban - he ended up leaving to become a huge star, but he was in our class in freshman year. I remember Josh was this nerdy kid in a turtleneck with a voice from heaven.","I got my Equity Card with my Broadway debut when I did 'Rent.' I was in high school, and I came to New York to do that show.","I think art, at its best, happens on a conscious and a subconscious level.","If you're an open channel when you're onstage, if you're just a vessel, things are going to come out that are stored away deep in your DNA.","At 14, 15 years old, I started reading 'Backstage' regularly. Eventually, I got enough courage to look at the auditions section.","Making $1,260 a week at 17 years old? That was a million dollars a week to me!","It's about polarization. You're trying to stir up something in your audience.","I think I spent most of my childhood, and my early years as a performer, in student mode. And I think that's OK - I mean, it led me to where I am.","I have a great foundation, a great training foundation. But it took me a long time to let the training go.","I know what it's like to be ignored; when I got to L.A., I longed for somebody who looked like me to show me the ropes.","That was the bat signal for me - 'Rent' changed my life. It took me years before I got beyond that show.","I don't have any control over the offers that are going to come to me or not come to me. But I can't go backward, and so that's what's tricky.","Until you make a name for yourself, they're like, 'Be a little more Denzel,' 'Be a little more Wesley Snipes.'","What goes up must come down; I'm not going to be in 'Hamilton' forever. Everything I work on won't have this kind of success.","I think it was, my parents got me a karaoke machine when I was about 9 years old. Even before that, they got me a tape recorder that I used to walk around my life with. And there was something about recording and then hearing myself back.","Sometimes I think of creativity or art as this well that we all draw from.","None of us get to divorce ourselves from the world. We walk into the theater and bring all of our grief and our pain and our joy with us.","We don't get to get swept up, because we have to start over every day at 8 o'clock.","I want to know that I'm gonna knock 'em dead every night.","I've done a lot of translation in TV, and I can do it. I'm trained to do it. I know how to inject a certain amount of my naturalness into that and where I come from into those things, but it helps if somebody's writing with my experience in mind.","When I see the black experience - there's not one, but it is specific, and you can't ignore it.","I grew up in Philadelphia.","All I try to do is put as many colors as I can on the canvas every night.","I think for a lot of us, you know, what 'Hamilton' gave us the opportunity to, what it gave me the opportunity to do, was to go, 'Here's what I've learned in 35 years.'","You hear a song like 'Wait For It,' you hear a song like 'Dear Theodosia' - if you get one of those songs in a musical - one - it's worth dropping everything to sing that one song.","We want to pull out songs from the American song book, and we want to make them palatable for a modern audience.","I know it's hard for people to imagine a time when 'Hamilton' wasn't 'Hamilton,' but for years, it was just this little thing that I was telling people about that didn't make any sense to anybody as I was describing it. But I loved it.","I've spent a long time learning my way around a stage as an actor, but this I don't know as well. Humbly, I'm excited to get with a band and perform regularly as an artist and see what I can learn and how I can grow in that space.","When I step on the stage and sing 'Wait for It,' I'm singing that for everybody. I don't mean I'm singing it for them; I mean, you are their voice.","When we go and cheer Cynthia Erivo on in 'The Color Purple,' it's because we've elected her to be our voice. She sings 'I'm Here' for all of us.","If I'm allowed it, I'm really looking forward to a little time on the couch and a little time on a beach in Brazil.","I had no vision of me being a part of that show ever. But I was committed to being the first super-fan of 'The Hamilton Mixtape' that there ever was. I was in love with this thing.","'Rent' opened up my heart, my senses. I was never the same. I hadn't been back in that place in the same way since. 'Hamilton' put me back in that place.","'Hamilton' has restored my faith in theater.","I wanted to make an album that was hopeful and encouraging and inspiring. That was the goal.","I grew up in the Canaan Baptist Church.","I've been fortunate in my life. It hasn't been easy, but there has been a focus on the positive, and it has reverberated. Eventually, the outlook mirrors itself back to you in the friends you have, in the partner that you choose.","My dad was always in sales. My mom had a heart for the ages. Worked in recreation, doing rehabilitation in nursing homes. Very nice, practical folks who were very proud of me but had no inclination toward the stage in any way.","It's not about doing something that's as big as 'Hamilton.' That may never happen again, and that's okay.","I know what feeling broke feels like real well. I know that real well.","I know what not being able to pay your bills feels like real well... I know that way better than a room full of beautiful people and Tony awards and Grammy awards.","To get even realer with you for a second, as a black actor, as a performer of color, I don't know how many more roles like Aaron Burr are gonna come along for me.","The record company felt wisely that we should get something out before I left 'Hamilton' or around awards time, and that deadline was not easy.","I'm in no way running from 'Hamilton' or its success or these beautiful songs that I've been blessed to be able to be the one to introduce them. I certainly won't be the last to sing them, but to be the first, I feel very lucky.","I started out with this 'La Boheme' fantasy, but as you get older, the 'La Boheme' fantasy becomes less sexy, believe me.","I remember when I was in 'Rent,' Daphne Rubin-Vega threw a party. At the time, she had a loft in TriBeCa, and the elevator opened right into her apartment. I was like, 'I've never seen anything like that.' I didn't know it was possible.","There was a lot of the 'Hamilton' experience that was like a locomotive. It was a hurricane, so the apartment often looked like a hurricane. There were clothes and shoes all over. We were getting more things in than we had room for. We had to figure out how to make space for all the blessings and goodness coming toward us.","As an artist, I'm very used to waking up and sort of not knowing what my day's going to be and not knowing where my next paycheck is going to come from.","I'm addicted to growth.","I think that the best songs to sing are songs that you love, because you sing them with love when you love them.","There's this Frank Wildhorn tune 'Sarah' - it's not a widely known tune, but it's my favorite song to sing.","Donny Hathaway's 'For All We Know' is the song that I've sung the longest. It is a beautiful song about living in the moment and appreciating this very second. That is the song I did for my 'Rent' audition.","The time I spent in New York when I was 17 gave me the confidence to pursue my dreams with my whole heart.","People are coming to you at their most vulnerable; they're showing you the parts of themselves that they're afraid to show: the parts that they're not so sure about, not so secure in. And so it's a really holy profession I think, teaching. If you do it right, it can change somebody's life.","I grew up in Philadelphia in a time where we took it for granted that we were supposed to be young and gifted and black. It was a culture of excellence - and all my friends were more talented than I was.","It's still a political statement to stand on stage as a person of color and be excellent. We still need those images to combat the narrative we're often fed - as someone innately inferior or inexorably linked with lack.","My dad was an early hip-hop fan.","We didn't go to Broadway musicals when I was growing up; it was too expensive.","I remember Ella Fitzgerald sort of coming into my life like a bolt of lightning - like, what is that? It was one of the purest examples of God in art that I'd ever seen.","I've dedicated more than 15 years to this theater and television thing; I want to spend the next 10, 15 years or so devoted to music.","I don't want to leave anything offstage.","I kind of think we sort of subconsciously draw things into our lives, whatever we're trying to work through.","I can only imagine what the show would have meant to me as a 16- or 17-year-old. I know what 'Rent' meant to me in my life, how that show changed the course of my life, and we can only hope that 'Hamilton' will have the same effect on a few kids.","The bad guys have way more fun, in my opinion. 'Bad guys' in quotes.","There are certainly people who have committed horrific, evil acts in the history of humanity. I don't think Aaron Burr's one of them.","They're people who had flaws and who had affairs and had sex and had scandals, and very rarely do we look at the totality of our heroes' lives.","I'm so excited about my new partnership with the talented and motivated team at S-Curve Records!","You gotta prove yourself. I'm not above that. I will never be above that. Bring it!","What a casting director does is they're a connector.","I haven't gotten hundreds of jobs that I've auditioned for.","What's a better foundation for drama? You have power, you have ambition, you have sex... that's the stuff of drama.","I'm glad things worked out the way they worked out.","I'm an artist, and I like art that gets people talking, good or bad. Criticism is good, too.","I have to remind myself that it may never be this good again.","You need to put your head down and... try not to lose hope."],"Leslie Stephen":["Walking is the natural recreation for a man who desires not absolutely to suppress his intellect but to turn it out to play for a season. All great men of letters have therefore been enthusiastic walkers.","The truth cannot be asserted without denouncing the falsehood.","If atheism is to be used to express the state of mind in which God is identified with the unknowable, and theology is pronounced to be a collection of meaningless words about unintelligible chimeras, then I have no doubt, and I think few people doubt.","Every man who says frankly and fully what he thinks is doing a public service.","Chance is a name for our ignorance.","If you wish at once to do nothing and be respectable nowadays, the best pretext is to be at work on some profound study."],"Lester B. Pearson":["Of all our dreams today there is none more important - or so hard to realise - than that of peace in the world. May we never lose our faith in it or our resolve to do everything that can be done to convert it one day into reality.","As a soldier, I survived World War I when most of my comrades did not.","We know now that in modern warfare, fought on any considerable scale, there can be no possible economic gain for any side. Win or lose, there is nothing but waste and destruction.","It has too often been too easy for rulers and governments to incite man to war.","When you're special to a cat, you're special indeed, she brings to you the gift of her preference of you, the sight of you, the sound of your voice, the touch of your hand.","As for the promotion of peace congresses we have had our meetings and assemblies, but the promotion through them of the determined and effective will to peace displaying itself in action and policy remains to be achieved.","We must keep on trying to solve problems, one by one, stage by stage, if not on the basis of confidence and cooperation, at least on that of mutual toleration and self-interest.","The grim fact is that we prepare for war like precocious giants, and for peace like retarded pygmies.","I am grateful for the opportunities I have been given to participate in that work as a representative of my country, Canada, whose people have, I think, shown their devotion to peace.","I cannot think of anything more difficult than to say something which would be worthy of this impressive and, for me, memorable occasion, and of the ideals and purposes which inspired the Nobel Peace Award.","The choice, however, is as clear now for nations as it was once for the individual: peace or extinction.","A great gulf, however, has been opened between man's material advance and his social and moral progress, a gulf in which he may one day be lost if it is not closed or narrowed.","The scientific and technological discoveries that have made war so infinitely more terrible for us are part of the same process that has knit us all so much more closely together.","Politics is the skilled use of blunt objects.","Today continuing poverty and distress are a deeper and more important cause of international tensions, of the conditions that can produce war, than previously.","Every state has not only the right but the duty to make adequate provision for its own defense in the way it thinks best, providing it does not do so at the expense of any other state.","The life of states cannot, any more than the life of individuals, be conditioned by the force and the will of a unit, however powerful, but by the consensus of a group, which must one day include all states.","As a civilian during the Second War, I was exposed to danger in circumstances which removed any distinction between the man in and the man out of uniform.","As to the first, I do not know that I have done very much myself to promote fraternity between nations but I do know that there can be no more important purpose for any man's activity or interests.","No state, furthermore, unless it has aggressive military designs such as those which consumed Nazi leaders in the thirties, is likely to divert to defense any more of its resources and wealth and energy than seems necessary.","And I have lived since - as you have - in a period of cold war, during which we have ensured by our achievements in the science and technology of destruction that a third act in this tragedy of war will result in the peace of extinction.","But while we all pray for peace, we do not always, as free citizens, support the policies that make for peace or reject those which do not. We want our own kind of peace, brought about in our own way.","I have worked in a very close and cordial way with Norwegian representatives at many international meetings, and the pleasure I felt at those associations was equaled only by the profit I always secured from them.","It would be especially tragic if the people who most cherish ideals of peace, who are most anxious for political cooperation on a wider than national scale, made the mistake of underestimating the pace of economic change in our modern world.","The stark and inescapable fact is that today we cannot defend our society by war since total war is total destruction, and if war is used as an instrument of policy, eventually we will have total war.","Today the predatory state, or the predatory group of states, with power of total destruction, is no more to be tolerated than the predatory individual.","True there has been more talk of peace since 1945 than, I should think, at any other time in history. At least we hear more and read more about it because man's words, for good or ill, can now so easily reach the millions.","Until the last great war, a general expectation of material improvement was an idea peculiar to Western man. Now war and its aftermath have made economic and social progress a political imperative in every quarter of the globe.","We are all descendants of Adam, and we are all products of racial miscegenation."],"Lester Bangs":["Every great work of art has two faces, one toward its own time and one toward the future, toward eternity.","Corporations are social organizations, the theater in which men and women realize or fail to realize purposeful and productive lives.","The first mistake of art is to assume that it's serious.","Nothing ever quite dies, it just comes back in a different form.","The great thing about The Clash of course is that they keep searching for answers beyond that.","When kids can't afford to see it anymore maybe we'll have a whole resurgence of garage bands all over America and this New Wave thing will start to mean something on a grass roots level.","The thing is that, they all had real strong personalities and real distinct identities, and I don't find most of the groups that are coming out now really do.","That's one reason why it's pretty worthless, I can't totally buy it, if you think about it, it's things like the Phil Spector records. On one level they were rebellion, on another level they were keeping the teenager in his place.","Or like in the early 70's when we had the reaction against acid rock and all the fuzz tone, and feedback, and the noise. And you had James Taylor and everyone went acoustic and that.","No, I see it as meaning very little at the moment because none of the groups are about anything.","No I don't think it was a myth at all, anymore than what the recession that the whole country was experiencing was a myth, which obviously seems like it's going to get worse and worse.","Most of them are pretty down records, pretty unhappy, pretty confused. Which only reflects how people in general were feeling, I mean really the sense that you get is society running down.","It's much easier to wear a Chairman Mao button and shake your fists in the air and all that, then to actually read the Communist manifesto and things like that and actually become involved in politics.","I'm really schizophrenic about that, because on the one hand I would say, yes there is, there's something inherently, even violent about it, it's wild and raw and all this.","I mean the interesting thing I think would be if something happened like, what happened in England where all these kids that all of a sudden can't afford the ticket prices.","I mean it's easier to be in a demonstration if it's a trip that's one of the reasons why the whole thing fell apart in 1971, because it wasn't a trip any longer.","I mean Iggy and The Stooges first couple of albums I think sold twenty five thousand between the two of them you know and so to talk in terms of an underground I mean you have to go really to the independent labels and things like that.","I hate Stanley Clark, but I have to admit he's playing Jazz whether I like it or not.","I don't see that there are any particular changes in popular music.","Here we are in the 70's when everything really is horrible and it really stinks. The mass media, everything on television everything everywhere is just rotten. You know it's just really boring and really evil, ugly and worse.","Basically no, I mean I think that it's very easy to like I say, smoke a joint or even to wear a Chairman Mao button, or do a lot of these things with out knowing what's behind it, and what it really means.","As far as a truly radical conscience, you have to take it as part of a larger thing, that it was sort of historical inevitability that with the coming of a leaguer society people would start to use drugs a lot more then they had before.","And doing so you can recreate yourself and you can also come up with something that is not only original and creative and artistic, but also maybe even decent, or moral if I can use words like that, or something that's like basically good.","The ultimate sin of any performer is contempt for the audience."],"Lester Bowie":["They always say that jazz doesn't sell, but it's a lie, because it does sell, and it sells consistently year in and year out.","We're just beginning to learn the importance of music in our society.","The trumpet is forceful."],"Lester Cole":["The Japanese say, If the flower is to be beautiful, it must be cultivated.","Forgive your enemies, but first get even."],"Lester Holt":["Not to get too deep on shaving my mustache, but it was kind of symbolic of, 'This is a moment of liberation, a chance to reinvent yourself.' That's kind of what I did.","You never know what doors are going to open up and why they are going to open up. You've got to be ready to walk through them.","As Americans, we rightfully place tremendous value on having a free and independent press. Our role as journalists is to give voice to the voiceless, and hold our leaders and institutions accountable. But the circle is only completed when that information is consumed by a free-thinking and engaged audience.","What I've come to know is that in life, it's not always the questions we ask, but rather our ability to hear the answers that truly enriches our understanding. Never, never stop learning.","For 30 years I've been schooled in everything from government, and economics, to medicine and international relations. But don't be impressed. Someone once said being a general assignment reporter simply means you are equally ignorant about most everything. In other words, I know a little about a lot.","On more than one occasion, the camera has cut to me after a break as I'm still trying to swallow the last bite of cookie. Those of you who have thought to yourselves, 'That guy talks like he has marbles in his mouth,' should know that they are not marbles, but oatmeal cookies.","I have a couple of basses in my office. And I try to be courteous of my co-workers, but sometimes I get carried away and I crank up my amp and I rock out. It's kind of my stress reliever.","I remember when I interviewed at MSNBC, one of the first things they said to me was, 'In your tapes, you had a mustache, right?' I said, 'Yeah, I recently took it off.' I said, 'If you hire me, you get to decide if you want it or not.' They said, 'No, no, we're fine with it now.'","Sometimes, I'll be flipping the channel at home and think, 'Wow, there's a lot of me on TV.'","I really bristle when I get called to events and people introduce me as one of the top black anchors in the country. You know, that's very insulting. I'm striving to be one of the best anchors in the country. Handcuff me like that. What you're saying is, 'You're black. You should only expect to rise to the level of the best at being black.'","There's no experience like going down an empty freeway toward a hurricane and then looking in the opposite lane and seeing bumper-to-bumper traffic, people fleeing that scene. Or going to a toxic spill and seeing people go the other way. You talk yourself into thinking you're invincible in order to do that.","Anybody who was in the military or a military family has a certain sensitivity to the separation. Everyone knows military wives have the hardest jobs. I was born into one. When I think back to those days, I didn't appreciate it then.","Journalism is my first love. But music comes in a close second. What's important for me is that whatever you do, whatever your passion is, you should have another passion - something in your life. And when I put on that musician hat and I put the bass in my hands, I'm not Lester Holt the TV guy anymore. I'm just Lester Holt who likes music.","I'm not terribly athletic. And... there's a lot of things I'm not good at. And if it makes anybody feel better, I was really a pretty bad math student growing up.","The problem with being a journalist is you go places and you're working. You don't get to appreciate everything. But I got enough of a sampler of South Africa; I thought, 'I want to come here when I don't have to interview people for a living so that I can really enjoy it.' Because I think it was just a magnificent place.","UC Merced is the University of California's newest campus and lies among farm fields in the San Joaquin Valley, 2 1/2 hours east of San Francisco and not far from where I spent most of my childhood. It's a part of California that has suffered deeply from the recession with high unemployment and a skyrocketing home foreclosure rate.","I'll co-host 'TODAY' from Los Angeles Saturday morning and then make my way up to Merced for that evening's graduation ceremony. I'm still touching up my remarks, but my challenge to the Class of 2010 will be to break through the deafening and too often negative echo chamber of the digital era and become critical and independent thinkers.","You have to go where the story is to report on it. As a journalist, you're essentially running to things that other people are running away from.","You know there's some great folks, great story telling at 'Dateline,' and I'm glad to be a part of it.","I never believed the anchorman should be the know-it-all. And I try to communicate that to the audience. While I have some knowledge from my years of experience, what I want to do is walk you through this because we're all walking through this together.","At the end of the day, I'm reading the news. I'm not digging ditches. I'm not fighting fires. It's a long day, and it's a lot of responsibility, and it can be a little bewildering sometimes with the schedule. But, you know, it's a job, and they pay me well to do a job.","I have this vision of maybe going the way of Bill Kurtis and, I think, Tom Brokaw, to a certain extent - the ability to not be tied to the desk anymore, but to do projects that are meaningful to you.","I reluctantly soldiered on to the raccoon. It actually would have tasted quite good had I not had the image of a raccoon rummaging through the garbage stuck in my head.","You can't exactly do it from your hotel room. It's the weather; you've got to get out in it. You're telling people that there are 70 mile-per-hour winds. So it's like, 'Let's prove it.'","Everyone knows I'm black. I am who I am. This is the person that Lester Sr. and June Holt raised, and I make no apology for it. At the same time, I'm never going to pull a race card to get what I want. You can't have it both ways.","As a 13, - 14-year-old kid, I'd sit on my bed with a tape recorder and a newspaper. I would do my own newscast. I would practice my diction.","I've never been one to carry race on my sleeve, and I've never been one to really use my race.","A lot of times we work across multiple platforms. We'll go to Japan working on the tsunami for 'Nightly News' and it'll end up on 'Dateline.'","I'm a morning person, so rising at 4-something on weekends is not a huge challenge for me. I am not, however, much of a morning eater - not at that hour, at least.","When we run out of them upstairs, I've been known to appropriate some from our greenroom, pocketing a few with one hand as I smile and greet our guests with the other. One time, Dave Zinczenko of 'Eat this, Not That!' fame, busted me in the act. The cookies apparently fall in the 'not that' category. I made a note of it.","The one thing I don't consume during 'Today' - which surprises many people - is coffee. I find that a lot of water helps wake me up, without the buzz. I love coffee, but usually reserve a double espresso as an afternoon pick-me-up before settling in to do the weekend 'Nightly News.'","The issues of the day have never seemed more complicated, and yet the conversations over how to solve them increasingly resemble cars passing down a divided highway. Whizzing by without a glance.","Today we all are enjoying the fruits of the digital era. Millions of sources of information coming at us at lightning fast speed. That technology has also democratized the gathering and dissemination of news, allowing for 'citizen journalists' to make their mark, even usurping the role of mainstream news organizations at times."],"Lester Maddox":["That's part of American greatness, is discrimination. Yes, sir. Inequality, I think, breeds freedom and gives a man opportunity.","Honest businessmen should be protected from the unscrupulous consumer."],"Letitia Baldrige":["Tea time is a chance to slow down, pull back and appreciate our surroundings.","Good manners are cost effective. They not only increase the quality of life in the workplace, they contribute to employee morale, embellish the company image, and play a major role in generating profit.","Politeness decrees that you must listen to be kind; intelligence decrees that you must listen to learn.","I'm a businesswoman, and Ms. is an appropriate form of address.","A bride is a bride the first time around. The white dress and the white veil are symbolic. So many people are breaking the rules that people don't know what the rules are.","Manners make the world work. They're not only based on kindness but also efficiency. When people know what to do, the world is smoother. When no one knows what to do, it's chaos.","When in doubt, look at what everyone else is doing.","For every rude executive who makes it to the top, there are nine successful executives with good manners.","If you really screw up, send roses.","Manners are nothing more than thinking about somebody else.","Chivalry isn't dead. It's just no longer gender-based.","We're a nation of latchkey children. Manners start at home, and no one is at home teaching manners so that children have respect for others.","The whole art of flirting has simply disappeared. This probably will do further damage. If we're going to become so uptight that we can't say nice things to each other, then we've had it!","The best thing we can do to save the planet is set a good example for our kids at home.","A real thank you does not come by e-mail. They come in the mail in an envelope. And what comes out of an envelope is a beautiful thing to touch and to handle and to pass around for everyone to read.","Make people have a smile when they finish your e-mail.","Going to a party uninvited always has been a negative action. It never has been acceptable. At the very least, it upsets kitchen preparations, parking arrangements, and even details such as space for hanging coats and depositing dripping umbrellas.","We are not passing values on to our children. We are not sitting down at the dinner table talking about the tiny things that add up to caring human beings.","If you care enough to look right, you care enough to act right. And vice versa.","Most people don't know how to take compliments. That's the biggest problem in America - we're hesitant to give compliments and embarrassed at getting them.","A man or woman can be known and respected for good taste, regardless of job or income level, if they make good choices in clothes, have good table manners, are kind and organize their home to look warm, welcoming, clean, and appropriate to their station in life.","If you're making a social call, don't call past 8 P.M. The evening is a time when people need a respite from their work - a time to unwind, uninterrupted.","I've had a charmed life.","I saw an e-mail from one guy who's about 23 to one of peers. His parting sign-off was 'Don't let the bedbugs bite.' Now that's really poetic.","You don't want to work so hard that you can't enjoy your guests.","What the bride should do is call guests who have young children and say: 'I'd love to have the kids at the wedding, but we won't have room. Would you get a baby sitter, and when we get back from our honeymoon, we'll have you guys over?'","The polished executive is ultimately the happy executive who can walk gracefully through life.","I think that what we should do is have short, clipped conversations on the telephone so someone can always get us, not talking about inane stuff and having someone trying to get you. I also think we've just got to be more sensitive toward other people and not call them at night if you know they've been working.","I don't ever knock anybody; that's bad manners.","There are major CEOs who do not know how to hold a knife and fork properly, but I don't worry about that as much as the lack of kindness.","I don't care what your politics are, I would wager that if you asked any American woman which administration would she have most liked to work for as social secretary, she would pick Jacqueline Kennedy's White House as the place to be.","I have grandchildren who are going to need every cent I make.","At home, we're listening to TV or playing with our computers, so our entertaining is rusting. We don't know how to be good hosts and guests in business situations.","CEOs are called by their first names by young whippersnappers. That makes everybody uncomfortable. We need order and structure back in the workplace.","If golfers know they look good, they will play better. I think that is valid for men and women.","I've had three broken legs and two knee replacements. But I'm very good at apres golf.","I've become a master of the apology.","There is so much bad manners and oafishness in large corporations.","A really first-class company uses really fine stationery.","If you take five taxis a day, one driver will be nasty, and the other four are perfectly nice. You remember the nasty one. But you should remember the four who were nice.","We ought to be vigilantes for kindness and consideration.","If somebody is disrespecting somebody, we should step in - even at the risk of getting slugged over the head.","Before the Kennedys were elected, there had been older Presidents. Then here was this devastatingly attractive young couple with two beautiful children. They were so intelligent, graceful, gracious and funny. They enjoyed life so much. That's what caught America's eye.","It behooves everyone to move forward, think forward.","When you pass 70, you forget your enemies. You think about the nice people instead.","It's nice to compliment people on what they're wearing, but don't make insincere compliments.","When someone is wearing a dress that makes her look fat, don't say 'That's a great dress.' It always comes off badly.","Nothing ruins the flow of conversation more quickly than refusing a compliment you have just received. Never disagree with something nice that is said to you or about you.","I never made any money, but I had the best jobs in the world.","When writing a thank-you if you've had lunch with someone downtown, send an e-mail. If somebody is giving you a dinner party in his or her home and all the work that takes, that person deserves a written thank-you.","I'm for anything that teaches consideration and kindness. If one can teach one's son to dance with the ugliest little girl in the room, that's the best lesson they can ever learn.","For every step forward in electronic communications, we've taken two steps back in humanity. People know how to use a computer and answering machines but have forgotten how to connect with one another. Our society is unraveling. We're too self-obsessed.","Knowing when and where to sit is something every young executive should learn. A junior person who comes barging into a room and takes any seat he wants catches the disapproving eye of senior management.","Business colleagues who have not seen each other for a long time but who have a good relationship can always shake hands warmly and grab each other's right upper arm or shoulder with their free left hand. Men and women executives should not kiss each other in public.","If you are someone's guest on a corporate jet, the most important thing to remember is not just to be on time, but to be early. If you hold up the departure of the jet by as much as 10 minutes, you may cause the plane to wait in line for another hour or two before obtaining new clearance.","Look at all those unattractive people talking about depraved things all day long on TV talk shows. People can talk about themselves, yet the art of conversation, which has to do with sharing, is disappearing. I feel as though I am chasing a runaway locomotive.","You'd be surprised how much easier it is to conduct business over tea than over lunch or dinner in a bustling restaurant.","Everybody forgets names and faces, and it's just inconsiderate to expect someone who isn't your boss or your sister-in-law to know exactly who you are.","If the flu situation in your town is serious, cancel a large long-awaited party you had scheduled, but promise the guests in an e-mail that you will reschedule the party as soon as possible.","Writers on etiquette receive a continuous flow of questions on subjects such as 'When is it too early in the season to wear white accessories?' and 'What is the proper gift to send to a family in mourning?'","For years, people have re-dialed when the line was busy. They waited their turn. When I'm put on hold, I always hope that as my revenge, their other call will be someone wanting to sell them something.","Doubleday is used to my talking about manners because I am, after all, known for that, and that's my persona.","I talk about beepers going off in the middle of a concert and people being late and not apologizing, and people not RSVP-ing, and adult children going back to live with their parents, which we didn't have in the '60s and '70s.","We have lost the art of conversation. People are shy and don't know how to approach other people, and they are missing opportunities for relationships. And no one's entertaining at home anymore. They're not having people over for dinner.","An excellent wine, someone's best attempt at cooking, and the candles and flowers on the table can turn the simplest dinner into an unforgettably romantic event.","It's very important with these young people who are graduating and getting married to write thank-you notes.","Go to any bookstore, and you'll see thousands of books on etiquette, which suggests there's a lot of self-help going on. There is hope.","More young people are aware of the need for thank yous and aware of the tremendous impression they make.","When somebody throws something out the car window, honk at them, but don't give them the finger. We've got to temper our negative feelings about people who desecrate the environment.","We have a lot of societal problems that we have to fix in the 1990s.","I believe in teaching manners without causing fisticuffs.","Nothing gets on other people's nerves at the office more than a whistler. And the sad part is, these whistlers don't know they're doing it. Someone should, tactfully, tell the whistler how much it disrupts the office environment.","Jeans of any sort should not be worn in nice restaurants. They pollute the landscape. They should also not be worn in the workplace if no other workers wear them. However, if your office is casual, go for it.","Jeans should never be worn to someone's home if you are having dinner there.","I'm all for Hillary Clinton. I want her to avoid the barbs of women who hate women who work. But I'm known as a Republican in Washington. I'm probably the last person she'd call.","All of the First Ladies were good, creative and strong. I've always said they should be paid.","The First Lady has a lot of power. I hope Hillary Clinton realizes that.","Kids today and for the last 20 years have held the fork and knife in unbelievable ways. They hold the fork with a fist and the knife like a saw and they shovel it in. It doesn't matter to them which way they hold their knife and fork. They eat every which way. I'm amazed they get food into their mouths at all.","Eating American-style, you put the knife down and clang. Continental is silent and efficient.","Backpacks are obtrusive. They're great for school kids and mountaineers, but a woman is supposed to look enticing and glamorous at night. They obscure one of a woman's most erogenous zones, the nape of her neck. I suppose they're good if you want to keep men away.","People are less grateful than they used to be.","We need grace in our lives, and I'm not talking about heavenly grace. I'm talking about human grace. We should try and be warm and friendly.","President and Mrs. Kennedy would walk into the East Room with their honored guests, preceded by the military color guard, who then posted their flags behind the receiving line. This ceremony never failed to move all of us, no matter how many times the staff witnessed it.","The Kennedys tried to avoid using the big U-shaped table, but when they couldn't, they had several tricks - including keeping the flowers simple - to keep it from appearing overly stiff and formal.","Administrations had come and gone in Pennsylvania Avenue, but many old entertaining traditions had survived - thru habit and not thru merit.","Crashing could not be more inconsiderate to a host. It is a negative act because hosts likely have a particular plan for the event, an intention to move guests' attitudes in a certain direction.","The custom of going to a party only when we have been invited is a necessary, attractive, decent way for a party to evolve.","That's how a nation's manners are going to be taught - from watching others' behavior and learning from the effects of that behavior.","Europeans are easily offended by errors in their titles or full names. Their exasperation is equal to that shown by Americans when the department store fouls up their bills.","One cannot reject an entire nation because of the politics of its leader.","I was considered the luckiest of all the female gypsies since I landed the job as social secretary to Ambassador and Mrs. David Bruce at the American Embassy.","Arranging an official dinner in an embassy is a little like writing a script for a play. The prolog is the guest list, often the most difficult part of the whole creative operation.","The '80s have not been a gracious decade, and people are seeking ways to be nice to each other.","At tea time, all the noise, greed and aggressiveness of the '80s can be drowned out. For 45 minutes, anyway.","You don't need the White House to please people. You can be 24, earning $22,000 a year, and have people over to your tiny apartment. It's all about sharing and thinking about what will make others happy.","It's stylish to have people over. But unstylish to make them bring food. It's so tacky, making everybody appear at the door with a dish. Better to order in, use a caterer or bring prepared food into your kitchen.","We need to reach out - spend more time together.","To have people to the White House and worry about the price of things is laughable."],"Letitia Elizabeth Landon":["I think hearts are very much like glasses. If they do not break with the first ring, they usually last a considerable time.","An apt quotation is like a lamp which flings its light over the whole sentence.","Delicious tears! The heart's own dew.","A brier rose whose buds yield fragrant harvest for the honey bee.","Society is like a large piece of frozen water; and skating well is the great art of social life.","Were it not better to forget than to remember and regret?","Whatever people in general do not understand, they are always prepared to dislike; the incomprehensible is always the obnoxious.","Ah, tell me not that memory sheds gladness o'er the past, what is recalled by faded flowers, save that they did not last?","We need to suffer, that we may learn to pity.","No thoroughly occupied man was ever yet very miserable.","Enthusiasm is the divine particle in our composition: with it we are great, generous, and true; without it, we are little, false, and mean.","All sweeping assertions are erroneous.","Few, save the poor, feel for the poor.","How disappointment tracks the steps of hope.","There is a large stock on hand; but somehow or other, nobody's experience ever suits us but our own.","We might have been - these are but common words, and yet they make the sum of life's bewailing.","Everything that looks to the future elevates human nature; for life is never so low or so little as when occupied with the present."],"Letitia Wright":["What I would love, instead of being a role model, is being someone of inspiration.","I would love to be producing movies, acting in more movies, and doing projects that are Oscar-worthy... have kids, be married, all that, being a normal human being as well, balancing it all out.","I still have a lot to prove within the industry as a young person in the Marvel Universe.","Makeup is cool. I mean, you can turn up and feel really good and treat yourself, but it shouldn't be something you hang on to to validate your beauty or something you have to do to make you feel beautiful.","When I was a kid, people bullied me about my weight and being skinny. Throughout my teenage years, I had to just depend on the fact that, look, this is who God created me to be, so I'm going to depend on what's already there.","If I want to put makeup on, then, cool, I'll do that. But it's not going to be my crutch.","I was born in Guyana, South America.","I don't come from a creative background. I don't know anyone in my family who is a musician or actor or singer. It's a lot of teachers, lawyers. Professional stuff like that.","That's something I would love to do - play leading roles and really hold it on my own in those leading roles.","I'm not trying to be famous, I'm not trying to be the next whatever. I'm just trying to be someone that contributes positivity with my talent.","So many young black women love science, technology, engineering, and maths. But that's not the widely held image of the kind of person who likes those things.","In my country where I was born, Guyana, we push more for education. It's more being a lawyer, doctor, teacher, or scientist.","It was cool to play an African princess who's the smartest in the whole world. That never happens. So I hope all the young girls can feel smart, too.","I wish I watched movies like 'Hidden Figures' when I was a kid, and maybe I would've taken science classes super seriously, because I saw myself.","I'm really proud of the Time's Up movement, and I hope it continues and it grows stronger and that it can really be established.","I have little brothers and sisters, and they annoy me a lot, but I love them so much because they're so smart and witty.","Everybody has their thing that they're truthful about. My thing is just a love of God... so that's what I'm going to do.","I said, 'Okay, Jesus, I'll try you,' and I haven't looked back since.","I don't really consider myself religious. I view it more as a relationship. And if anyone thinks that's weird, then okay.","I have to also get into producing if I want to see these stories being made... Let's venture out and do projects with people of different ethnicities: not just black but also Asian actors and Asian superhero films. Just an equality across the board.","Wherever the good stories are, I'm trying to place myself there.","I'm not really wanting to be famous.","With 'Black Panther,' it was like stepping up to the plate, working crazy hours, and still bringing your best to the table every time.","Tottenham was a dope place to grow up because it's so community-based. It's a melting pot of cultures. I'll always be a north London girl.","I started doing amateur theatre and played Rosa Parks at the age of 12 or 13. At 16, I decided it was what I wanted to do.","I love Drake; he's amazing.","I want to do stuff like 'Lady Bird.' I want people to say, 'She told amazing stories.'","I didn't see a lot of role models or women who looked like me on screen when I was growing up. For me, one thing that changed all of that was seeing Keke Palmer in 'Akeelah and The Bee.' That film made me realize that I wasn't an alien.","'Black Panther' has made me embrace my natural black hair. The representation of natural black hair in the film has made me reflect on myself.","I want people, no matter who they are to be inspired by 'Black Panther.'","When I need motivation, I just think I can do everything if I maintain a strong sense of will.","The 'Black Panther' world taught me about the importance of exfoliating.","I'm just a young girl trying to fulfill the purpose that's been placed in my heart to do.","In my mind, I don't really see myself as being famous. I just think my work is being exposed to a bigger audience.","No, I'm not super-smart and tech-savvy.","I'm not perfect. As a Christian, you're not perfect, you know, but you're walking every day and trying to stay connected.","I needed to take a break from acting, because I really idolized it. So I came off from it, and I went on a journey to discover my relationship with God, and I became a Christian. It really just gave me so much love and light within myself. I felt secure, like I didn't need validation from anyone else, or getting a part.","Say you want to be with someone, and you're doing something that they don't really like. They're gonna ask you to stop it, just for a moment to take a look at them, to see them clearly. That's what God wanted for me.","I gave my life to Christ, and I thought that would be it for me, and He was, like, 'No, you're not finished with acting; acting is not finished with you. This is your talent. Go back into it, but you're going back into it with a heart that's not obsessive over it.'","As soon as I was obedient to just taking a chance on God, all of these things that you're seeing - 'Black Panther' or 'Humans' or 'The Commuter' or Steven Spielberg - it came right after I took that break.","I love theater - it's where every actor should begin, the core of acting. But I feel that there's something about film that's captivating; it takes you to another , and you get to really be so connected with it.","Netflix is my homepage.","I'm very interested in the human mind, what's going on in there.","I think the more open-minded people we have - like casting directors and producers - the better things are going to be.","I fell in love with Jesus, and I'm still in love. Amen!","Where I go, where He takes me, that's where I need to spread the love of God. Because people's souls are dying. My soul was dying. And He saved me.","I just want to do something meaningful in the world. I want to contribute positively. That means the roles I get to play as well.","We're all people, no matter what colour.","When I came to England, everybody was indoors all the time, and nobody said hello to each other. That was weird.","We come from Guyana; we don't have an acting industry.","I realised that acting is not my god.","I don't need to be validated by anybody else; I don't need to be accepted or approved of for my happiness.","I'm centered in who I am, and I'm really grateful. I'm not perfect.","Maybe we can have an all-female Marvel film. We've been talking about it. It's only a matter of time.","My approach is the truth and aiming for the truth.","If I can be of inspiration to anyone to go after their goals and their dreams, then I feel like I'll be satisfied with that.","My aim is just to remain as humble and as godly as I can be.","I grew up seeing so many stereotypes on TV, and I didn't want to play that as well.","We need to include more writers from different backgrounds and ethnicities. We need to see different experiences instead of the same people writing the same kinds of stories."],"Letty Cottin Pogrebin":["Housework is the only activity at which men are allowed to be consistently inept because they are thought to be so competent at everything else.","Although Freud said happiness is composed of love and work, reality often forces us to choose love or work.","America is a nation fundamentally ambivalent about its children, often afraid of its children, and frequently punitive toward its children.","If family violence teaches children that might makes right at home, how will we hope to cure the futile impulse to solve worldly conflicts with force?"],"Lev Grossman":["Even though I have spent literally years of my life trying to learn another language, any other language - and even though I have in the past claimed in several key professional contexts that I speak other languages - I am in fact still trapped inside the bubble of English.","More than fantasy or even science fiction, Ray Bradbury wrote horror, and like so many great horror writers he was himself utterly without fear, of anything. He wasn't afraid of looking uncool - he wasn't scared to openly love innocence, or to be optimistic, or to write sentimentally when he felt that way.","I loved fantasy, but I particularly loved the stories in which somebody got out of where they were and into somewhere better - as in the 'Chronicles Of Narnia,' 'The Wizard Of Oz,' 'The Phantom Tollbooth,' the 'Dungeons & Dragons' cartoon on Saturday morning in the '80s.","I recognize that on paper, you can't really tell that I'm a fan or a nerd.","Every year the literary press praises dozens if not hundreds of novels to the skies, asserting explicitly or implicitly that these books will probably not be suffering water damage in the basements of their authors' houses 20 years from now. But historically, anyway, that's not the way the novelistic ecology works.","I've read plenty of J.G. Ballard, but I'm not really a Ballardian. I've met Ballardians, and I know when I can't compete. I like Ballard in his relatively unchallenging apocalyptic mode: 'Vermilion Sands,' 'The Drowned World,' 'The Burning World,' 'The Crystal World.'","I ought to at least be able to read literature in French. I went to an enlightened grade school that started us on French in fifth grade, which meant that by the time I graduated high school I had been at it for eight years.","When I got to college I simply decided that I could speak French, because I just could not spend any more time in French classes. I went ahead and took courses on French literature, some of them even taught in French.","It's a terrible thing for a book, when you feel like you're supposed to like it.","How often have I met and disliked writers whose books I love; and conversely, hated the books and then wound up liking the writer? Too often.","Hating a book is not unlike hating a person; in fact it's tempting to just go ahead and hate the author personally, by proxy, qua human being, except that I know that would be a mistake.","It's not really possible to open 'The Casual Vacancy' without a lot of expectations both high and low crashing around in your brain and distorting your vision. There's no point pretending they're not there.","I have spent many, many hours reading J.K. Rowling's work. I am a known 'Harry Potter' fan.","A lot of young-adult authors, great ones, have tried their hands at literary fiction, and not a lot of them have succeeded. Not even Roald Dahl could switch-hit, and not for lack of trying.","What surprised me about 'The Casual Vacancy' was not just how good it was, but the particular way in which it was good.","When I left college I thought - based on a staggeringly inadequate understanding of how the world worked - that I might like to go into book publishing.","I'm happy to report that 'The New Press' is still in business to this day. But not thanks to me. I was a really bad publishing intern.","I guess I was raised in a household with a lot of reverence for the physical sanctity of books. You didn't destroy books.","Becoming an author changes your attitude too. Once you see where books come from, and how they're made, they never seem quite as sacred again.","I mean, when you're tired of book reviews, you're tired of life.","I love rare books. Not that I own a lot of them, mind you. You couldn't quite call me a rare-book collector. But I did once work in a rare-books library, and I wrote a novel about a rare book.","My specialty as a collector is books that almost have value. When I love a book, I don't buy the first edition, because those have become incredibly expensive. But I might buy a beat-up copy of the second edition, third printing, which looks almost exactly the same as the first edition except that a couple of typos have been fixed.","One already feels like an anachronism, writing novels in the age of what-ever-this-is-the-age-of, but touring to promote them feels doubly anachronistic. The marketplace is showing an increasing intolerance for the time-honored practice of printing information on paper and shipping it around the country.","Being a writer can be isolating. It's good to be among readers and booksellers.","Which is the healthier kind of literary diversity: an un-gate-kept self-published book world, run substantially through Amazon? Or our current book world, which is part-gate-kept, part-not, with many different publishers and retailers and platforms? I'm not smart enough to figure it out, but if I had to guess I'd guess the latter.","I've drunk Amazon's free Diet Coke. Nothing makes more sense to me than a company trying to make bookselling into a profitable business. I'm not anti-Amazon, and I'm not pro-publishers either. I'm pro-books.","I've stayed in houses that were in the country, and in England, but I'm still not sure that I've stayed in an English country house.","It's no longer possible to simply build English country houses out of words, because they've already been so thoroughly described that all the applicable words have been used up, and one is forced to build them instead out of words recycled and scavenged from other descriptions of other country houses.","The paradox of the English country house is that its state of permanent decline, the fact that its heyday is always behind it, is part of the seduction, just as it is part of the seduction of books in general.","The year after I graduated college I had a job in a library. When people underlined passages in the library books, or made notes in the margins, the books were sent to me. I erased the lines and the notes. Yes, that was my job.","When it comes to true humility in the face of history, nothing beats complete silence.","I'm not one of your knockabout, knuckle-scarred, Internet-controversy-courting book critics. Occasionally I stumble into controversy accidentally, but not because I enjoy it. It's probably just because I'm a weird person.","It seems to me that the novel as a medium has a very low signal-to-noise ratio. By which I mean: there are a lot of novels published, but the vast majority of them don't represent major contributions to the medium.","It's a great thing when you feel that you recognize yourself, deeply and movingly, in a work of literature.","I got my first whiff of what big-time adult literature was all about when I was in 8th grade. I got it from Mark Linn-Baker. You know - the guy from 'Perfect Strangers.'","I started thinking about the endings of novels not because I think endings are so important, but because I think they're actually not as important as they're sometimes given credit for.","Oddly, the meanings of books are defined for me much more by their beginnings and middles than they are by their endings.","I read a lot of literary theory when I was in graduate school, especially about novels, and the best book I ever read about endings was Peter Brooks' 'Reading for the Plot. '","A novel with a bad middle is a bad book. A bad ending is something I've just gotten in the habit of forgiving.","Book tours are excellent things, and one is lucky to get to go on one, but they have a way of leeching away one's will to live.","I don't know if I've ever derived such an immediate sense of calm and well-being from any book as I did from 'Right Ho, Jeeves.' It was like I was Pac-Man and the book was a power-up.","People - me included - want to get excited about books. Good books are a good thing.","The novel is a highly corrupt medium, after all - in the end the vast majority of them simply aren't that great, and are destined to be forgotten.","I've only read three books by Stephen King. When I was 10 I read 'The Long Walk,' one of his pseudonymous Bachman books. In my early 20s, while trapped on a family vacation, I read 'The Dark Half,' which taught me a word I have never forgotten: psychopomp. Now I have read '11/22/63.'","I'm not a Dickens guy. In grad school I had to take at least one course on the Victorians, so I took The Later Dickens, because that was what there was.","It's natural for a child to assume that his or her own childhood is unremarkable.","The real world is horrible.","There's a special gut-check moment the first time you write a scene in which somebody casts a spell.","Growing up in the '70s and '80s, science fiction and especially fantasy had such a stigma attached to them. I felt so punished and exiled for being devoted to these things.","I went to college at Harvard, then did three years of graduate school at Yale. At both places I studied comparative literature. People find it odd that I went to both Harvard and Yale, and I guess it is odd, but that's just what people did where I grew up.","I came from an anxious, overly intense East Coast academic family. That was the way of our tribe.","Supposedly I've got traces of an English accent, though I can't hear it. I must have inherited it from my mother, who's English, and then I think it was exacerbated by the fact that I live with an Australian.","I studied the cello for a long time, from when I was little up through college.","I used to write in a local coffee shop, but there was another guy, another writer, who kept sitting in my favorite seat. I would show up, and he would be there, and I would get exiled to a couch or something, and it would throw me off my game.","Until now, I've been a kind of binge-writer - I'll carve out five or six hours on a weekend day and make a large container of espresso and just bang out a lot of words.","I think every fantasy reader secretly believes they know how magic works.","I never thought about doing a sequel when I was actually writing 'The Magicians.' I only ever considered it a standalone.","And I'm not as young as I once was. At my age, I don't have time to be bored.","My book group has one rule: no books for adults. We read young adult fiction only."],"Lev Vygotsky":["What a child can do in cooperation today, he can do alone tomorrow.","A child's greatest achievements are possible in play, achievements that tomorrow will become her basic level of real action.","In play, a child is always above his average age, above his daily behavior; in play, it is as though he were a head taller than himself.","Somehow our society has formed a one-sided view of the human personality, and for some reason everyone understood giftedness and talent only as it applied to the intellect. But it is possible not only to be talented in one's thoughts but also to be talented in one's feelings as well.","The most significant moment in the course of intellectual development, which gives birth to the purely human forms of practical and abstract intelligence, occurs when speech and practical activity, two previously completely independent lines of development, converge.","Love can reach the same level of talent, and even genius, as the discovery of differential calculus.","A mind cannot be independent of culture."],"Lev Yilmaz":["Even in a gleefully negative comic, there is optimism, although it's slightly hidden: It comes out through a comic character's sheer tenacity. He keeps going and trying to find some sort of fulfillment regardless of his perpetual failure record. That's a form of hope, a form of optimism. Really hokey I know, but it's true.","I don't personally try to balance my work because I operate under the assumption that anyone reading or watching my stuff isn't having a particularly balanced day anyway. But negative attitudes just amuse me more than positive ones.","When you get down to it, at it's root, Comedy is truth, absurdity, and pain. One of my little mottos is: 'Do you remember the Peanuts cartoon where Charlie Brown kicked the football and kissed the Little Red Haired Girl? Neither do I.'","When was the last time someone told you 'Look at the bright side of things' when you were depressed, and you actually paid attention to them? Maybe some people do, but I sure as hell don't.","Whenever I get the sort of fancy pants idea that I'm doing anything other than pure expression things start to go wrong. When I get too premeditated, things start to go wrong. I just shut that part of my brain off.","One of the primary motivations for the series is that I never really felt that I was a person who could explain verbally what I thought all that well.","My mom had gotten a Super 8 camera to make home movies with, and my brother and me got our hands on it and ran with it.","We made satires of everything - news broadcasts and TV shows that we watched. When I look at them now, they are totally amateurish, but I find it quite remarkable that we were so skeptical of the world! My parents watched them and thought they were funny; they really encouraged us.","I came home in the afternoon to sleep, and there was this e-mail from Comedy Central saying they were interested in having me be part of this new show called 'Jump Cuts'! So I called them right away, and the producer started laughing and said, 'We sent that e-mail one minute ago - you're so fast!'","A lot of people feel that there is less artistry involved in cartoon making unless they have painstaking control of each frame.","The same sort of thing was supposed to happen when performance animation was invented: Everybody thought it would save so much time. But it became its own niche altogether."],"Leven Rambin":["I've never been the wilting flower. I've never been the girl who's subservient to a man.","Everything is an experience. You learn something different from everything you do.","I'm so fascinated by the concept of teen pregnancy for some reason. Not that I condone it or promote it, but it's just a very real thing in our country and culture.","A lot of hard work has to go into your career, and preparation, and being your best at all times.","It's been difficult to find roles that are independent, strong, and self-assured; I always say I can't play the princess. I'm not a pretty princess! I'm a tomboy.","So I always think it's important to allow someone to reveal themself. If you notice something about someone that you like, it could really tell you something about who they are during a time of trial. The truth will come out.","I was like, 'Whoa, I'm auditioning for 'Hunger Games?' That's like my dream come true. That's like a Trekkie auditioning for 'Star Trek.'","When you're connected to the ocean, you really don't think about what's going on with your email or texts or any of that. You're just a lot more liberated.","I did some pretty crazy stuff that I never thought I would do, for the sake of a movie, like surfing in eight-foot waves in pitch-black darkness, where I can't see anything. That still haunts me, kind of, in my nightmares, but it was worth it, it was fun.","I'm not particularly fond of the Hamptons.","If I had a crush on a guy, my tactic was to tell them I had a crush on them. And they always thought it was super-cute, so it usually worked in my favor!","I like that New York sensibility where you can be edgy, but still super-glamorous.","Why sit on your butt watching 'Jersey Shore' when you can learn to paint a beautiful picture?","As a Christian, I think it's really important to find a man of God to trust and be supportive of me.","I'm at the age where I just want to experiment. You know, play a crime investigator one week, a pregnant girl one week, an angel of darkness another week. I don't want to define myself by any category, or age, or role.","I feel a lot older than I am but at the same time I don't want to play too old on T.V. I still want to be young. I still want to be 20 and enjoy this period of my life where I still have that flexibility.","When I was a kid, I was into psychological thrillers. When I was 12, my favorite movie was 'Thirteen.' I just really liked movies that showed an extreme range in acting. That's what made me want to become an actress."],"Leverett Saltonstall":["I attended Sunday School and then church with my father and mother throughout my childhood.","I have always felt that a man's religion was his personal and private affair.","I have confidence that the Unitarian Church will steadily grow and will help to sustain many of my fellow citizens in these important days that lie ahead of us.","I have the utmost respect for the different faiths professed by my fellow men.","I personally have always found the Unitarian faith a source of comfort and help in my daily life.","My family for several generations have been members of the Unitarian Church.","Too many of my Senate colleagues overdid it. They stayed on too long - napping through committee hearings when they should have packed up and gone home."],"Levi Dylan":["I gave up on music. I still love to play, but it's too hard to make a living. And I think that was a mature decision to make.","I get labeled as a model, but if I had it my way, I would hope nobody would ever call me that.","I don't have any interest in being in Warner Brothers' newest comedy if it's going to suck but still be a box office hit and make me famous. I want to do things that are cool and that I can be proud of.","Nobody wants to listen to rock and roll anymore.","I don't know that I have a favorite actor, but I will say that I'm inspired by Dennis Hopper."],"Levi Miller":["I've seen pretty much all the 'Peter Pan's except for one of the further back ones where the boy had curly hair. I can't remember. I really loved the 2003 version. I really loved that one because that was around the year I was born. That's quite funny.","I try to help my mum as much as I can by not being rebellious.","Every time you go on a set, it's a whole different world, and I love that.","I definitely want to grow intelligently, but I do want to stay a kid forever!","When I got the phone call that I was told I was Peter Pan, I freaked out, because I was like, 'Wow! How does that happen?' But pretty much, from there on, everyone's been so lovely.","Not many people get to play the lead character in a gigantic film and model for Ralph Lauren; it's amazing.","It's been amazing to play a character that's known by so many people, especially because everyone knows at least something about Peter Pan.","When I was about six or seven, I did this character reenactment performance where I read a monologue from 'Peter Pan.' I got into a complete Peter Pan outfit and did a little paragraph from the script - and I ended up winning an award for it.","I do rock climbing and tennis.","I definitely have a strong connection with Ralph Lauren because I've made so many friends there. But I love being an actor - and I think that's what I want to be."],"Levi Strauss":["An expert knows all the answers - if you ask the right questions.","Objects are what matter. Only they carry the evidence that throughout the centuries something really happened among human beings.","If the composer withholds more than we anticipate, we experience a delicious falling sensation; we feel we have been torn from a stable point on the musical ladder and thrust into the void.","In the old days, people used to risk their lives in India or in the Americas in order to bring back products which now seem to us to have been of comically little worth.","We can understand, too, that natural species are chosen not because they are 'good to eat' but because they are 'good to think.'","Gifts make slaves."],"Levi Woodbury":["Presumptions of guilt or innocence may sometimes be strengthened or weakened by the place of birth and kind of education and associates a man has grown up with, and good character may at times interpose, and justly save, under suspicion, one who is accused of crime on slight circumstances.","Juries must, of necessity, be governed, in reaching many results through inferences from other facts, by certain laws of nature and human reason. They are often obliged to infer one thing from another, and this, whether that other be a fact direct or circumstantial.","It is essential to the pure and peaceful administration of justice that all its officers keep carefully within the boundaries of their constitutional powers. Auxiliary to this, but not secondary in importance, is a due knowledge of the leading subjects for their inquiry and decision.","Laws fixed, certain, and uniform, are said to be the distinguishing traits of civilized from savage communities. In these last, seldom are any laws, unless it be the arbitrary and uncertain will of the strongest.","The very idea of the law in a constitutional republic involves the requisite that it be a rule, a guide, uniform, fixed and equal, for all, till changed by the same high political power which made it. This is what entitles it to its sovereign weight."],"Levon Helm":["Good times don't last long sometimes.","I don't think I'm a millionaire, but I'm comfortable.","If you give it good concentration, good energy, good heart and good performance, the song will play you.","Drums just always sounded like the most fun part of that good music for me.","A friend of mine took me to Memphis advised me that I should get in the musicians' union. He gave me a set of drums and said, Stay on the job, son.","If you pour some music on whatever's wrong, it'll sure help out.","There were no rules, other than that the song should sound good and be fun to play.","Songs don't wear out. Good songs are good now. If they were a comfort during those hard times in the past, they'll be a comfort in today's age.","Most of our stuff was trial and error. You live with a tape recorder, you turn it on, you play the song and you listen to it.","Anytime I switch to another instrument, I immediately turn it into another kind of drum so that I can understand it better.","Forever Young, by Dylan, is one of my favorite songs.","I don't fool with a lot of things that I can't have fun with. There's not much reward in that.","I've always thought it was easier for girls to sing harmonies because their voices can go to that higher plane so much more easy than a male voice.","The crowd is just as important as the group. It takes everything to make it work.","The rock star stuff never came up for us. The Band was never attacked by groupies before, during or after any show that we ever played.","By the time The Band did The Last Waltz, the chemistry had changed, and it wasn't a thrill anymore to live that studio kind of life.","Conway Twitty was always our local hero while I was growing up. He had a series of good bands. I wanted to sit in, if Conway would let me. And he did a couple of times.","Dad and mom would have preferred that I be a doctor, a lawyer, a scientist, or a great humanitarian.","Don't we all want what's best for each other?","Drums usually seem to tune themselves.","I like to get within handshaking distance of the crowd. If it happens, they know it, we know it, and that's all we came here for.","I like walking on the edge.","I love horns, and the bigger the band, the better it sounds to my ear.","I never subscribe to the stay-at-home policy. I'm not sick of the road or sick of eating in good restaurants around the country. I like to travel.","I played some Yamaha drums that I like a lot. And I like the Yamaha people a lot too. They've been really nice to me and The Band.","I was in high school, trying to get out of high school. The only thing slowing me up was grades.","I've had all the lessons I could get. I've learned from everybody I've ever met.","If things are going slow, I'm itchy.","If you feel like you're getting into a rut with a song, a night off usually fixes it.","Lord, when the song wants to pick up and go a little faster towards the end, it's hard for me to resist.","My dad and I played music. He teaches me a song or two every time I'm home.","The Band never really played big concert tours. We never sold millions and millions of albums.","The Jungle Bush Beaters didn't last too long as a group, but we had a pretty good time while we did.","The way to do it is to put as much life into the song as I can. You can either get it to breathe or you can't.","We all love musical architecture; there's no doubt about that.","We're all dealt with the same hand here, so to speak. I feel like I've had it a lot better than most people. I've had the opportunity to travel and play music all my life.","Well, somebody's got to sing. They won't hire you unless you sing.","When the second record came out, they started calling it The Band. I voted to call it The Crackers. I'm no fool.","With horns and a full rhythm section, the drums always looked like the best seat in the house.","You can either make it come around or you can't. By the time we would be ready to record a song, we would know for sure that it was the best way we could do it.","When I was younger, I used to drive up to a bunch of turkeys, roll down the window and say something. They'd all gobble back at once.","You got to pick one - pay your medical bills or pay the mortgage. Most people can't do both, and I'm no different.","We live in an age of miracles.","If it doesn't come from your heart, music just doesn't work.","I had throat cancer, and I had to have radiation treatments, and I couldn't sing for a long time; and this was in '97. I had 28 radiation treatments. I didn't die, thank God.","I don't hear record companies coming up with any good ideas or suggestions. Historically, if it ain't their idea, it ain't no good, so you got that to contend with.","It's different playing in a studio than it is playing live, of course.","My parents wanted me to be smart and be a scholar, and the best I could do was graduate high school."],"Lew Brown":["And love can come to everyone, the best things in life are free.","So how can you lose what you've never owned?"],"Lew Temple":["When I was cast for 'Walking Dead,' I was still doing 'Lone Ranger,' so I have my 'Lone Ranger' look with the handlebar mustache. I think everybody appreciates the professional mustache.","It's all about the stache, and I have so many fans that offer me tips on mustache wax that I actually really appreciate. I've been able to get some leads on some good products.","'The Walking Dead' never wants you to get too comfortable with characters and cast members. I think about the time you feel fairly secure with your appreciation of a character is about the time the show will gut-punch you.","I'm a leukemia survivor, and I recall during my darkest days in the hospital when my friends would come to see me, especially the male friends - they had certain mortality issues with their visit."],"Lew Wallace":["When people are lonely they stoop to any companionship.","The monuments of the nations are all protests against nothingness after death; so are statues and inscriptions; so is history.","Beauty is altogether in the eye of the beholder.","One is never more on trial than in the moment of excessive good fortune.","As a rule, there is no surer way to the dislike of men than to behave well where they have behaved badly."],"Lew Wasserman":["I think the executives have matured enough so that they recognize that we have a two-party system. In California, we have more than a two-party system.","I think that our primary concern is that the membership in our industry become active. I'm not talking about the candidates being active. I'm talking about the few hundred thousand people who work in the industry around the United States.","Well, it was a typical meeting with the President. He was very gracious, very outgoing.","Things have changed a great deal since the days of Mr. Mayer. The studios no longer control, as they did in those days, artists or directors or producers, as the case may be.","You tend to meet on a more regular basis with people in your industry, and reality being what it is, you tend to meet with them at the particular level that you occupy; so that develops a fraternity relationship.","President Johnson offered the middle of the road.","We had an interesting thing at that first dinner. It was prior to the availability of several new hotels in Los Angeles, and we were more or less committed to the old Ambassador Hotel that has the famous Coconut Grove.","That room was not available, and the only other room had been booked for a Jewish bar mitzvah. I called the father and told him I needed the room and I would pay him to move the bar mitzvah to an adjoining room which was smaller.","To me, it's the White House and always will be.","I believe Johnson understood that the reason was Vietnam. I also believe that he felt that if there was a way to communicate the real issues in Vietnam, that the reasons would be answered or understood. But there was just no way to communicate.","I was through as a manager. I did become involved late in the 1968 campaign at the national scene at the last minute. But I was through as a manager, and I've stayed through, incidentally.","Paul Newman's an old friend of ours out of Cleveland, Ohio. He used to sit around our house. He's the only man I've ever known to drink a case of beer all by himself. That's talent in a way."],"Lewis B. Hershey":["When we know as much about people as hog specialists know about hogs, we'll be better off.","Between a fellow who is stupid and honest and one who is smart and crooked, I will take the first. I won't get much out of him, but with that other guy I can't keep what I've got.","A boy becomes an adult three years before his parents think he does, and about two years after he thinks he does."],"Lewis B. Smedes":["Forgiving does not erase the bitter past. A healed memory is not a deleted memory. Instead, forgiving what we cannot forget creates a new way to remember. We change the memory of our past into a hope for our future.","To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you.","It takes one person to forgive, it takes two people to be reunited.","The problem with revenge is that it never evens the score. It ties both the injured and the injurer to an escalator of pain. Both are stuck on the escalator as long as parity is demanded, and the escalator never stops.","What is a disloyal act? A person is disloyal if he treats you as a stranger when, in fact, he belongs to you as a friend or partner. Each of us is bound to some special others by the invisible fibers of loyalty.","You will know that forgiveness has begun when you recall those who hurt you and feel the power to wish them well.","The Holy Spirit, thank God, often enables people to forgive even though they are not sure how they did it.","Promise keeping is a powerful means of grace in a time when people hardly depend on each other to remember and live by their word.","Seeing reality for what it is is what we call discernment. The work of discernment is very hard.","At the cross, God was punishing Jesus for the sins of the world. God's justice required a penalty from sinners, and in his unspeakable love, he paid the penalty himself in the person of his crucified Son.","Restorative justice is not a replacement of retributive justice, but a complement. It seeks the rehabilitation of the wrongdoer and the repair of the victim's injury.","Any lazy or biased fool can have opinions; making judgments is the hard work of responsible and compassionate people.","Our sense of fairness tells us that people should pay for the wrong they do.","The right to personal privacy is precious. Without it, we are all potential victims for a prying secret police.","Sometimes I like to list the strongest arguments I can find to support a point of view I think is wrong. When I have them before me, I am up against a real opponent rather than a hypothetical one that is an easy target for me to hit.","God does not give us salvation because we believe. Our believing is only the normal way of receiving the salvation he freely gives.","No one really forgives unless he has been hurt.","Forgiving is love's toughest work, and love's biggest risk.","Nothing enables us to forgive like knowing in our hearts that we have been forgiven.","We are anxious in the face of our unchangeable past; we long to recreate segments of our private histories, but we are stuck with them.","When we forgive evil we do not excuse it, we do not tolerate it, we do not smother it. We look the evil full in the face, call it what it is, let its horror shock and stun and enrage us, and only then do we forgive it.","Our society is pluralistic. We who accept the privilege of membership in that society agree to respect the people's right to live by their own religious precepts.","Our history is an inevitable component of our being. One thing only can release us from the grip of our history. That one thing is forgiveness.","In a sinful world, no community can exist for long where nobody is ever held accountable: no teacher would grade a student's performance; no citizen would sit on a jury or call a failed leader to account.","God is not a doormat, nor should anyone else be a doormat.","Some people have loved ones they will not forsake, even though they are a pain in the neck.","When we have been badly injured and clearly wronged, we make an instant caricature of the person who did it to us. We define him totally by the one wrong he did.","My father was only thirty-one when he died of a heart attack, much too young for a father to die and leave his young wife with five rambunctious little kids to take care of. I was the youngest. Only a couple of months old when he died.","The God who has the whole world in his hands has grace for the whole world in his heart.","Some people still make promises and keep those they make. When they do, they help make life around them more stably human.","Some people still have causes they will not desert, even though the cause seems lost.","Nothing is more private than a woman's body; it is her physical, emotional, and moral citadel. She cannot be free at all if she is not free to decide for herself, in private, what to do with her body.","As I read the New Testament, I find only one path to salvation - the path of an informed faith in Jesus Christ.","True, the apostles did not expressly say that people will be saved only if they repent, believe, and confess. But most evangelicals assume - with good reason - that this is what the apostles implied.","I believe that we should, on biblical grounds, tell all parents of mentally disabled children that God loves their children, regrets terribly that they are disabled, and will, when they die, carry them gently into a heavenly life where every person is forever whole.","Common sense suggests that if no one ever judged other people, there would be no real human community.","Modern Americans suffer from a fear of judging. Passing judgment on the behavior of fellow human beings is considered an act of medieval, undemocratic intolerance.","No doubt, corporate CEOs who lie to their shareholders and politicians who lie to their public know and believe intellectually that lying is immoral. Why then do they lie? They lie to others because they first lie to themselves.","The lies we tell ourselves are the most subtle of all lies.","Nobody sees reality whole; we all need others to show us the parts of it that they see better than we do. Nobody sees reality with total accuracy; we all need others to correct our own vision.","Retributive justice did not arise from any Christian principle; almost every pre-Christian society dealt with wrongdoers by causing them pain.","Jesus said that we should render to the state what properly belongs to the state, and though he had taxes in mind, we might reasonably infer that giving the state the job of punishing wrongdoers is one way of giving the state its due.","The blood of Christ covers all of our sins, but each of us must do personal business with God in order to experience his forgiveness."],"Lewis Black":["I like coffee because it gives me the illusion that I might be awake.","You can never put too much pork in your mouth as far as I'm concerned.","There's no such thing as soy milk. It's soy juice.","I believe that summer is our time, a time for the people, and that no politician should be allowed to speak to us during the summer. They can start talking again after Labor Day.","Self-love is a big part of golf.","When it comes to idiots, America's got more than its fair share. If idiots were energy, it would be a source that would never run out.","In my lifetime, we've gone from Eisenhower to George W. Bush. We've gone from John F. Kennedy to Al Gore. If this is evolution, I believe that in twelve years, we'll be voting for plants.","I watch some CNN and a lot of Fox, because it helps me get irritated.","I like college football, but I'm a huge college basketball fan. I could sit and watch every game of March Madness and be happy. That could be a vacation.","There should be a law that you can't shut down the government - that you don't have that power.","I love anything that gets me outside of my own head.","Basically I wake up in the morning and I think everything's going to be great. I'm really kind of optimistic, and I look forward to a new day. I pick up 'The New York Times,' and I look at the front page and realize that once again I'm wrong. I start to fixate on stuff.","Do you know what 'meteorologist' means in English? It means liar.","If you're going to vote for somebody because you think they have a great faith in God, you'd better be sure that God has faith in them.","One thing I know about the rich, being rich, is that you can take money from me and tomorrow, I'm still going to be rich.","In Vegas, you have an audience you can't find anywhere else. It's from all over the country. You play Seattle, everyone's from Seattle. But in Vegas, you have six from Seattle, a bunch from L.A., some local Las Vegans and maybe a farmer from Iowa. In Vegas, you learn the ins and outs of holding a room because of that great spectrum of folks.","You don't want another Enron? Here's your law: If a company, can't explain, in one sentence, what it does... it's illegal.","Being a playwright is like the equivalent of doing a jigsaw puzzle that has 1,500 pieces, and it's a jigsaw of a blue sky. Not a cloud in sight.","What I've found in my career is that 70 to 75 percent of comics are nice and have some sense of social skills, but there are those who end up in comedy because they don't know how to socialize. I don't want to deal with that group.","As psychotic as it gets outside, the comic can be more psychotic.","Usually I'm too tired to apologize.","It's absolutely stupid that we live without an ozone layer. We have men, we've got rockets, we've got saran wrap - fix it!","The worst thing about Halloween is, of course, candy corn. It's unbelievable to me. Candy corn is the only candy in the history of America that's never been advertised. And there's a reason. All of the candy corn that was ever made was made in 1911. And so, since nobody eats that stuff, every year there's a ton of it left over.","Democrats are like a big tortoise that's on its back and can't get up; you can't make jokes about that.","When a country wants television more than they want clean water, they've lost their grip.","I think one reason people play golf is it allows them to obsess about something other than the daily crap. It takes your mind off that.","Parenting isn't just parenting your own child.","For a while, I thought the great disappointment of my life was that I don't have a family of my own. Then it dawned on me: That's not what I think; that's what married people think.","The people we elect aren't bipartisan. The American public is bipartisan.","It's a privilege to pay taxes. Yeah! It's not a political question, folks. We have to pay for stuff.","The Democrats have responded to the Republicans' lack of dealing with reality by truly not dealing with reality, either.","Every time I use an app, part of my brain dies! We'll get to the point where we go to bed and wonder: 'Did I have a thought today?' You'll have to go to your 'Thought' app!","I like my friends because they make me feel normal, even though I'm not.","If you're working out in front of a mirror and watching your muscles grow, your ego has reached a point where it is now eating itself. That's why I believe there should be a psychiatrist at every health club, so that when they see you doing this, they will take you away for a little chat.","Everybody's got cable.","I get an idea about something. I just start thinking about it, and then I get onstage and I talk about it, and then I think about it some more and talk about it some more, and think about it some more and talk about it some more, until it starts to take a shape.","If I get a week off, I'll go to a hotel that has a golf course. I like to come downstairs and go right onto the course. I'll do that five days in a row.","What I find most disturbing about Valentine's Day is, look, I get that you have to have a holiday of love, but in the height of flu season, it makes no sense.","I've been very lucky. There are guys I know who are really terrific in this business of stand-up who have not gotten the recognition they deserve. And it's nice, if you've put in the time, to achieve that recognition.","I don't buy the 'at 60 it's great to have kids' thing. I don't buy the line that has been thrown down - 'You can have a kid at any time.' That doesn't mean you should.","It's a big thing now: A lot of people want to be assistants to celebrities. If you're pursuing that, you're an idiot. You're a moron. The shortest distance between two points is not a celebrity, or being next to a celebrity.","All food is comfort food. Maybe I just like to chew.","When we anticipate, we're the happiest. Unless you're on antidepressants. The reason you take antidepressants is because you can't anticipate. You think everything's going to be horrible, so it usually is.","Everybody's family has different values.","All the candy corn that was ever made was made in 1911.","I don't need politicians doing a 24-hour prayer with Oral Roberts to get our country back on track.","If the people of New Zealand want to be part of our world, I believe they should hop off their islands, and push 'em closer.","Republicans have nothing but bad ideas and Democrats have no ideas.","And I know this happens because I took economics, and I'd explain it to ya, but I flunked that course. Not my fault. They taught it at 8 o'clock in the morning. And there is absolutely nothing you can learn out of one bloodshot eye.","A father and two sons run Adelphia. It's a cable company. And they took from that company a billion dollars. A billion. Three people - three people took a billion dollars. What were they gonna do, start their own space program? 'Let's send the monkey to Mars, Dad!'","I do the same gig. I might change it a little; I might slow it down if I'm in the South. I talk fast, and they're not used to people talking that fast.","I think comics in New York are interested in being comics. And there're comics in L.A. who are touring comics, who are certainly more interested in stand-up, but a lot of L.A. stand-ups are really looking to do something else.","You realize that for all the shenanigans that go on in the big circus of politics, everybody wakes up and goes to work.","I've always really liked theater. It fascinated me. You can create a reality and get people involved in that reality. It takes place in real time.","I was broke until I was 40. Really broke. I could get by, but I had nothing.","My father worked at the Naval Ordnance Lab, and they had a nine-hole course on the property. You paid a quarter.","I would like to play Pebble Beach at some point. I keep waiting for them to call and ask me to that little pro-am thing, but I'm not big enough.","I'm a Jew.","My touring has never stopped; from the time I started doing stand-up, I've been on the road.","I've got stuff about airline mergers, which just shows that my stand-up is getting more insane by the minute.","Basically, I started on stage yelling and I kept yelling, and then I yelled some more, and then I yelled even louder. I'm modulated now.","I'm a selfish, little pig of a man.","Online, there's no time. It's always Christmas.","I'm not a great joke writer, which is odd for a comic to say, but I'm not.","The whole Valentine's thing is fine, but you don't back it up right next to the biggest gift-giving holiday of the year. Unbelievable. And we find it acceptable.","I started playing golf when I was a kid, because across the street from where we lived there was a little nine-hole golf course where my father worked.","Saying that the Palestinian people aren't really a people - that's not a zany thing to say. That's a psychotic thing to say in the midst of all of the politics we live through on a daily basis.","I'm amazed that anyone is interested in what I have to say.","Janeane Garofalo ended up, in a sense, being pushed by the media into becoming a pundit.","It took forever for me to get work because I was a political comic, and now it's become good business, and God knows how long that'll last. You have to do it night after night after night to kind of make it. I still find myself on 'Piers Morgan' or on some show and I think, 'I hope this is funny.'","Political audiences are not fun.","I'm constantly in fear of having a stroke.","Democrats are dumb and Republicans are stupid, but the difference between dumb and stupid is dumb isn't funny. Dumb is when you say something and the whole room goes, 'What did he say?'","If we're not going to tax the rich anymore, we're going to create class warfare.","You look at my audience, and it proves what Congress thinks America is, is wrong. I get people across the political spectrum. Parents and kids come and they're all punked out, and there are these other guys in John Deere caps.","The thing that makes my generation The Greatest is our ability to hang out. We're spectacular at it. If you take somebody from my generation and sit them on a couch and bring them food and plumbing, they'll sit there and talk to you about anything you want until the day you die.","I don't understand how anybody's still a Democrat or a Republican. I don't know what they're basing it on.","You got to be just stupid to not be focused on alternative energy.","I'm a happy person but an angry citizen.","Socialism appeals to me. It's like imposed Christianity. You've got to share.","Republicans and Democrats can barely do what they're supposed to do, and they sure can't do math!","What makes it difficult for people trying to follow a dream is that the whole time you feel like you're slamming your head against the wall. So it's nice to make a breakthrough and not kind of lying there with your head bleeding.","People would be a lot better off if they'd enjoy being single.","I am angry that the Democrats don't have the ability to explain to Republicans that we should be able to feed people in this country, and that is not socialism.","Democrats should be focused on which way we can help the most people in this country, and Republicans should be focused on how to do that in the most fiscally responsible manner possible.","What you don't do, if you're an adult, is decide that you're going to budget things through a sequester. What does that word have to do with budgeting? It's like if you have a family budget and go, 'We really don't know what to take out economically from the budget, so we're going to whack out protein for this week.'","Let me be serious: divorce is a sacred institution between a man and a woman who hate each other. God wanted Adam to pay alimony to Eve, not Steve.","One of the interesting things about comedy is it's tension release, and nothing creates tension faster than anger.","The fine line that you do when you do political comedy is, as long as you have that laugh, you're fine.","Harry Reid is not funny; he's creepy. Nancy Pelosi is creepy. Charles Schumer is sneaky and creepy.","If you're going to pick a book and you want to base a system of government around it, why not 'Harry Potter?'","Stand-up is the only thing in which you actually write it, act it and direct it simultaneously, so it's actually a great theater exercise.","When I'm funny is when I'm angriest.","You've got to be stupid to heckle me - I am very equipped to win.","Kids seem to get me when I play colleges - they like it because I go after them. They'll come up after and say I am like their dads, only funny.","My parents were married for sixty-five years, and I was married for about ten minutes, my first year at Yale Drama School. Something, somehow, didn't get passed on to my generation.","Stupidity really gets me going, when it's just plain stupid, obvious stupidity.","The core of the American public, their hearts and their minds are in the right place. And that gives me hope.","Most of the longer-term relationships I've known have been gay relationships. They seem to be able to hang out longer.","This is how sad my life is: I got a scar from scratching my chicken pox too much. That's my big scar story. I really have no major scars.","You're on Facebook, and these people seem to have endless lives. I don't have time to live my life, let alone tell you what I'm doing, or post a photo.","I don't Tweet a lot because I've Tweeted things that I thought were really innocuous about subjects that are inflammatory, and the response is so insane sometimes from people.","The kids say golf taught them this and that. I get it with the military: A guy joins the military because he needs discipline and has to find himself. But don't tell me, 'Golf helps you find yourself.' I've been playing my whole life, and I'm still looking for myself.","I think that I don't panic as much as the folks on the left or the right do. I don't have that sense of panic.","Macs are not intuitive. It's intuitive to the person who created it. It's not intuitive to me.","I think the only reason you visit an Apple store is because you wonder what life is like on another planet.","My problem has always been with authority, and I'm sure if anybody understands that, it's people in uniform.","One of the most important things, especially when you're leaving school, is to realize you're going to be dealing with a lot of idiots. And a lot of those idiots are in charge of things, so if you're in an interview and you really want to tell the person off, don't do it.","No matter what, your parents are going to worry about you. I had a tour bus, and my mother still thought I was broke. Remember: It's your life, not theirs. Just because your parents sent you to college doesn't mean they bought the rest of your life.","If you yell about one woman, you're not a misogynist. If I yell about Michelle Bachman, that doesn't make me a misogynist. If I compare all women to Michelle Bachman, then I'm a misogynist.","When you're fund-raising for schools, then something's wrong. We seem to have lost some sort of sense of what the common good is, and if you don't have a sense of what the common good is, then at least give to what you think your specific goods are.","I'm not a big birthday guy; I never have been.","The fear of health care changing is beyond belief. Like there's a way to make the system worse. Really?","Everybody's always asking me about my blood pressure. They did an interview once where they hooked me up to a blood pressure machine and they'd rile me. I'd yell and scream, and then it would just go back to normal in a few minutes. Everything else is probably rotting, but the blood pressure is spectacular.","I continue to work on plays, but I've always felt that you could put a note in a bottle and send it offshore, and you'd have as much chance communicating with people.","When people come to my act any time after Thanksgiving, I usually say, You shouldn't be here. You should be shopping. Our economy depends on you! You should be out there buying stuff.'","I like indoor Christmas trees. And I like people who decorate their homes with lights and all that crap. I think it's a healthy outlet for them. If they weren't covering their lawns with twinkling lights, they'd be doing something that was really, really creepy.","I've got stress like anybody else, and it builds up during the day. Like, I'll be trying to do something on the computer, and I'll get stuck, so I go to the help section. And it just enrages me, because why even call it a help section at all? There's nothing in any way 'helpful' about it.","Nobody in college races home and says, 'I can't wait to see the news! I can't wait to see who CBS is going to hire!'","I think that many things that go on in an art school have a tendency to undermine confidence, and that shouldn't be part of the ballgame, ever.","Anybody who likes writing a book is an idiot. Because it's impossible; it's like having a homework assignment every stinking day until it's done. And by the time you get it in, it's done and you're sitting there reading it, and you realize the 12,000 things you didn't do. I mean, writing isn't fun. It's never been fun.","My parents are the last of the middle class. My father worked for the government designing sea mines. My mother was a substitute teacher. Together, they worked really only until they were sixty."],"Lewis Carroll":["If you don't know where you are going, any road will get you there.","One of the secrets of life is that all that is really worth the doing is what we do for others.","Sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.","Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle.","I can't go back to yesterday - because I was a different person then.","Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.","No good fish goes anywhere without a porpoise.","Contrariwise, if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic.","Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end; then stop.","'But I don't want to go among mad people,' said Alice. 'Oh, you can't help that,' said the cat. 'We're all mad here.'","She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it).","The rule is, jam tomorrow and jam yesterday - but never jam today.","We called him Tortoise because he taught us.","There comes a pause, for human strength will not endure to dance without cessation; and everyone must reach the point at length of absolute prostration.","Always speak the truth, think before you speak, and write it down afterwards.","His answer trickled through my head like water through a sieve.","I have proved by actual trial that a letter, that takes an hour to write, takes only about 3 minutes to read!","'The time has come,' the walrus said, 'to talk of many things: of shoes and ships - and sealing wax - of cabbages and kings.'","While the laughter of joy is in full harmony with our deeper life, the laughter of amusement should be kept apart from it. The danger is too great of thus learning to look at solemn things in a spirit of mockery, and to seek in them opportunities for exercising wit.","There are three hundred and sixty-four days when you might get un-birthday presents, and only one for birthday presents, you know.","Which form of proverb do you prefer Better late than never, or Better never than late?","'What is the use of a book', thought Alice, 'without pictures or conversations?'","Twinkle, twinkle little bat How I wonder what you're at! Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.","Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.","'When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, 'it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less.'","It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards.","Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love that makes the world go round.","That's the reason they're called lessons, because they lesson from day to day.","But I was thinking of a way To multiply by ten, And always, in the answer, get The question back again.","Take care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.","Sentence first, verdict afterwards."],"Lewis Cass":["People may doubt what you say, but they will believe what you do.","Only the most acute and active animals are capable of boredom. - A theme for a great poet would be God's boredom on the seventh day of creation."],"Lewis Clarke":["I've been through the entire list of Polar problems. I knew it would be hard, but it's harder than I ever thought it would be. I've suffered from blisters, a high-altitude cough, frost nip, and I even managed to break a ski they told me was unbreakable."],"Lewis F. Powell, Jr.":["I am primarily a lawyer. I would rather play in the game than be the umpire.","I do not enjoy being away from Richmond, my friends of a lifetime, and my home... I do not enjoy working 6 days a week and almost every night at a time when I had planned to be tapering off. There are compensations which appeal to any lawyer who is proud of his profession. The Supreme Court is an awesome place.","I don't believe I've ever met a homosexual.","Perhaps the single most effective antagonist of American business is Ralph Nader, who - thanks largely to the media - has become a legend in his own time and an idol of millions of Americans.","Effort should be made to see that the forum-type programs (the 'Today Show,' 'Meet the Press,' etc.) afford at least as much opportunity for supporters of the American system to participate as these programs do for those who attack it.","We have seen the civil rights movement insist on re-writing many of the textbooks in our universities and schools. The labor unions likewise insist that textbooks be fair to the viewpoints of organized labor. Other interested citizens groups have not hesitated to review, analyze and criticize textbooks and teaching materials.","The average member of the public thinks of 'business' as an impersonal corporate entity owned by the very rich and managed by overpaid executives. There is an almost total failure to appreciate that 'business' actually embraces - in one way or another - most Americans."],"Lewis Gordon Pugh":["On my second swim at Deception Island, the water was very clear and I was looking at hundreds of whale bones beneath me. It was a graveyard from the whaling some time in the 1920s-30s.","I just never, ever want to give up. Most battles are won in the 11th hour, and most people give up. If you give up once, it's quite hard. If you give up a second time, it's a little bit easier. Give up a third time, it's starting to become a habit.","We need to save the Arctic not because of the polar bears, and not because it is the most beautiful place in the world, but because our very survival depends upon it.","I learned two basic lessons on Everest. First, just because something has worked in the past does not mean it will work today. Second, different challenges require different mindsets.","Climate change is the Everest of all problems, the thorniest challenge facing humankind.","Swimming has been a very effective medium for telling a story about the state of our planet.","I think that I was slightly naive. I thought that if I showed people the beauty of the Arctic and the beauty of the polar bears that they would care so much that they would stand up and try to make a change.","In the cold, all the blood rushes to your core to protect your heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, and brain. When you leave the water, the blood rushes back to your arms and legs, absorbs that freezing cold, and brings it back to the heart.","The days of exploration of Shackleton and Scott are long gone. Everything has been climbed, crossed, done. Now what we're exploring are the full boundaries of human endeavour. It's not physical - it's all in the head.","The human body is not designed for swimming in minus 1.7 degree centigrade water.","When I'm preparing for a swim, I imagine absolutely everything about it: the color of the water, how cold it is, the taste of salt in my mouth. I visualize each and every stroke.","Of all the creatures in the world that really frighten me - the hyena in Africa, the great white shark - leopard seals are near the top of the list. They're killers. If my team spots one, they'll pull me out of the water.","I've been on swims where people have freaked out about sharks. You have to think about something else, otherwise it will absolutely paralyze you. I do math problems, anything.","The swim at Deception Island was by far the hardest swim I've ever done. Antarctica is a very unforgiving environment. If you don't train properly, you'll die.","Britain has bred many great explorers, but they seem to get so little coverage compared to soccer and rugby players.","I wish politicians would put the environment at the centre of every agenda.","Not to be too grandiose about it, but in a way I see myself like Sir Edmund Hillary. The water was my Everest.","On 15 July 2007, I swam across an open patch of sea at the North Pole to highlight the melting of the Arctic sea ice.","When I was born, the world's population was 3.5 billion. There are now 6.8 billion people on the planet. By 2050, that's expected to rise to 9.4 billion. What's more, the Earth's resources aren't growing; they're decreasing - and rapidly.","Normally I don't race other people; I challenge the environment and my own limitations.","The problem with climate change is that it's quite complicated for the ordinary person to understand.","I can't think of anything more important than the environment we leave to our children and our children's children."],"Lewis Grizzard":["The game of life is a lot like football. You have to tackle your problems, block your fears, and score your points when you get the opportunity.","If you ain't the lead dog, the scenery never changes.","It's difficult to think anything but pleasant thoughts while eating a homegrown tomato.","You call to a dog and a dog will break its neck to get to you. Dogs just want to please. Call to a cat and its attitude is, 'What's in it for me?'","I grew up in a very large family in a very small house. I never slept alone until after I was married.","I went last week to get hypnotized. To quit smoking. And the hypnotist said, 'The reason you smoke is you're bitter and depressed.' No, the reason I smoke is the little sucker tastes so good.","I think people are a lot more sensitive than they used to be, and quite rightly so. I don't think we should be using racial jokes and things like that.","If you ain't the lead dog, the view never changes.","Life is like a dogsled team. If you ain't the lead dog, the scenery never changes.","Instead of getting married again, I'm going to find a woman I don't like and give her a house.","You can write the best column in the world on Monday, and it does you absolutely no good on Tuesday. There is no way to win. You just write until you are tired, they fire you, or you die.","The public, more often than not, will forgive mistakes, but it will not forgive trying to wriggle and weasel out of one.","The public, more often than not, will forgive mistakes, but it will not forgive trying to wiggle out of one.","There's no such thing as being too Southern.","Yankees don't understand that the Southern way of talking is a language of nuance. What we can do in the South is we can take a word and change it just a little bit and make it mean something altogether different.","I wish one time in my life I could do what other writers do... get me a villa in Spain and go there to write a book.","I don't think I'll get married again. I'll just find a woman I don't like and give her a house.","I write 200 columns a year, you know. That means I have to have 200 opinions a year. Sometimes, I don't give a damn one way or the other, but that's my job, so I got to take a side.","Sex hasn't been the same since women started enjoying it.","Show business is my life.","'Redneck' has been terribly abused as a term. Where I come from, a redneck was a farmer who worked the fields all day and got his neck sunburned. People made fun of them.","Things are more complex today, and I think humor has changed a a great deal. People are more sensitive today.","I gave 738 Rotary Club speeches, and it was just driving me crazy, so someone said, 'Why don't you charge money?'","I'm a staunch believer in enterprise, and I'm glad I live in a country where - I don't think some people understand this, but if I work hard, I get rewarded for it.","I don't know how I do it, but I've written about everything. I've written about my shoes.","I don't think I'm a bigot or a racist. But I have a truck, a Blazer. I drink beer. There are some women I do hate.","I was raised to think women had babies, stayed at home, and men worked. By the time I got ready to do it, I thought I had all the answers. Only somebody had changed the questions.","I'd like to know what I could do if I really had the time to spend on writing a book, with no columns or shows to do at the same time.","A little irreverence is always important to being a columnist. I try to do that.","The South is the last place with a sense of place."],"Lewis H. Lapham":["Leadership consists not in degrees of technique but in traits of character; it requires moral rather than athletic or intellectual effort, and it imposes on both leader and follower alike the burdens of self-restraint.","I never can pass by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York without thinking of it not as a gallery of living portraits but as a cemetery of tax-deductible wealth.","Of what does politics consist except the making of imperfect decisions, many of them unjust and quite a few of them deadly?","People may expect too much of journalism. Not only do they expect it to be entertaining, they expect it to be true.","The supply of government exceeds demand.","Unlike any other business in the United States, sports must preserve an illusion of perfect innocence.","If a foreign country doesn't look like a middle-class suburb of Dallas or Detroit, then obviously the natives must be dangerous as well as badly dressed."],"Lewis Hallam":["As our expedition to New York seems likely to be attended with a very fatal Consequence, and ourselves haply censured for undertaking it without assurance of success.","A journey by Sea and Land, Five Hundred Miles, is not undertaken without money."],"Lewis Hamilton":["The way I drive, the way I handle a car, is an expression of my inner feelings.","I think my style is definitely urban chic. I love mixing street style with the high-end luxury brands, like Gucci, for example. Quite fun.","I don't aspire to be like other drivers - I aspire to be unique in my own way.","I don't believe I have a playboy life.","On my back, I have the cross and angel wings: rise above it, no matter what life throws at you. And also, you know, Jesus rose from the grave.","I like taking risks. I like trying new things, whether it be style or restaurants or whatever.","It's a pretty cool feeling to be the person to knock down a barrier - just like the Williams sisters did in tennis or Tiger Woods in golf.","Sometimes, I arrive at races more energetic and clear-minded than ever, and then I have a terrible race. And the opposite is also true.","You can knock me down, but I get up twice as strong.","I enjoy trying to develop a car and Mercedes are one of the biggest car manufacturers in the world.","Nothing can really prepare you for when you get in the Formula One car. Knowing that you're driving a multimillion-dollar car, and if you crash it it's going to cost a lot of money, and they might not give you another chance, is scary.","I get kids from all different cultures and nationalities coming up to me now, all wanting to be F1 drivers. They feel the sport is open to everyone.","It is open for anyone to have freedom of speech, and I guess we can all play a role in trying to make a difference in the world. Particularly if your leader is not helping in that area.","Going for a really long run, a bike ride, or cross-country skiing helps me get away from all the noise. I tell myself, 'The pain you're feeling, just enjoy it because it's going to help you across that finish line first.' If you're having a crap day, go for a run. It makes a big difference.","You just need to be accepted for who you are and be proud of who you are and that is what I'm trying to do.","Racing is what I love, so it's pretty simple. I want to keep doing it and keep winning.","I'm an extremist so I'm either hated or loved. I think it's down to when I first got to Formula One not always knowing what I was saying, saying things that mean one thing but people were taking the other way and then people don't forget.","As a driver, you've always got to believe in your heart that you've got what it takes to win it. You've always got to believe in yourself. You've always got to arrive on the day and believe it can happen. You've always got to believe in the positives.","It's important for everyone to stand up for what they believe in.","Every person I have met who has gone vegan says it is the best decision they have ever made.","I have always wanted to learn the piano, but because I travel so much, I can never get any consistency of lessons. So everywhere I go, if I can find a piano, even if it is in the lobby of a hotel or something, I go on YouTube and pick some songs to learn.","People might not know, but F1 drivers have new helmets made throughout the season. Usually, the design is the same, but I like to do something special for Monaco.","Working with kids is something I really enjoy doing - that's why I also do work with UNICEF.","I hate losing. It doesn't matter if it's racing or playing Ping-Pong - I hate it.","My job is to get into the car and drive as fast and as well as possible.","I'm just super competitive. Squash, tennis, water skiing, computer games... Even if I played you at pool, I'd have to win.","If Ferrari wanted me, they would have approached me. I want to work with people who want me. If they don't want me, it is no problem.","Everyone has complicated lives, but the more you can simplify it and make it work for you, the better it is going to be.","There have been some ups and downs. I've not always had it my own way. That's the way racing is supposed to be.","My immediate family are from the West Indies - from Trinidad and Grenada - and I have relatives all over the Caribbean.","You save most fuel by lifting and coasting in the heavy braking zones at the end of long straights into slow corners.","Since I started driving in F1 in 2006-07, the cars have got slower and easier to drive.","When I was really young, I busted my nose when I was racing. The first thing my dad asked me was: 'Are you OK?' I said, 'Can you fix the car for tomorrow?' And I won the race the next day.","When I'm driving, the fewer distractions there are, the better it is to focus on the job in hand.","My dad wanted me to have a better life than he had ever had. He wanted us to succeed so badly. And I never wanted to let him down.","I don't think you can fully call yourself a vegan if you wear leathers.","I'm keen on hiking. And in Monaco, I also like water skiing, wakeboarding, and jet-skiing, which are all pretty good for your arms, legs, and core stability.","F1 is about the best drivers competing against each other for the best teams producing the best cars they can.","Whether it's with my engineers in the team, my home life, or my friends, I don't like things to get complicated - and one good example would be the steering wheel in my Mercedes Formula 1 car.","People need to remember that I am the first black driver in F1, so I am obviously going to be different to past drivers.","When I think about greatness I just know Ayrton Senna. He was great.","What people tend to forget is the journey that I had getting to Formula One. There were plenty of years where I had to learn about losing and having bad races.","I love it in the States. The roads are big, the food is big. If it was possible to be in L.A. and still live my racing life, I would move now.","When you get out of the car after the feeling that you have after leading the race, and the car fails, it's pretty hard to say positive things all the time.","There are times when you are growing through experiences, but sometimes there is a point of diminishing returns in terms of growth.","I think every single win, every single pole has felt new and different in its own way. I've not got bored of it.","Every lap is different.","Each championship has felt different in its own way, I guess because I've been in different place of my life; I've gone through different things.","The Hamilton name will live on way beyond me now, which I'm very happy to be a part of.","Number one is a great thing, and I'll always know that I'm number one, but 44 is my favourite number, so I want to keep it on the car.","Music's been a huge passion of mine since I was really young. I started playing guitar when I was thirteen.","Fashion is a growing love that probably started when I got into my 20s.","When I was younger, all of my family's money went into racing. We were never a stylish family. We never went shopping, because all the money went into buying tires and fuel and all of that.","Tupac is my favorite artist, and he had mad style.","Formula 1 is about running to the maximum.","When I first started in Formula 1, I tried to ignore the fact I was the first black guy ever to race in the sport. But, as I've got older, I've really started to appreciate the implications.","Everyone loves a winner. That's just how the world is. And Ayrton Senna was one of the greatest winners this sport has ever had.","I started watching Formula 1 with my dad when I was just four or five years old. I loved cars.","People say I have an aggressive style, and sometimes I don't think that is all just me. I think it's partly because I watched Senna when I was young, and I thought, 'This is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity.'","Ayrton Senna was an incredible legend who will be remembered and admired forever.","I usually sleep four or five hours, but when you are training, you need more than that.","When you're driving on a normal track, you can see the braking point from 500 m. away.","I am a motorbike fanatic - always have been. It's actually what I wanted to do before I got into motor racing.","When I was a kid and Christmas was coming up, my dad would ask me what I wanted, and I always said a motorbike. I kept asking for one, and he said it was too dangerous and bought me a go-kart instead.","Despite the name, 'lift and coast' does not mean cruising. You're trying to be as fast as you can, and you're still going through the corner on the limit, but you have to approach the corner slightly differently; otherwise, you won't make the end of the race.","All in all, racing with lift and coast is actually harder.","Sometimes it takes time to find people in the sport who share the same opinions and approach to racing as me.","I have spent a lot of time in Italy throughout my career - especially when I was karting, because it's kind of the world centre of that sport - and I love it.","When I was a kid, I used to play a game called 'Grand Prix Two.' Interlagos was always the first race of the season on that, and I never really got much past the second race. I would always restart the season, so I always seemed to be doing Interlagos - it was a real pain!","My daily breakfast is two poached eggs in the morning with half an avocado, and I get to have half a piece of toast.","I love all of the Marvel comics movies.","I listen to music before every race. Generally, there will be a song I'll get into over the weekend, and I play it all weekend, particularly when I'm getting ready for a race.","I'm willing to take any amount of pain to win.","I feel like people are expecting me to fail; therefore, I expect myself to win.","A couple of my mechanics have become vegan because I've done it. One of my barbers, too.","It doesn't matter what famous person I've come across in the street, I don't think I've ever shouted.","I'm definitely conscious of time. I already waste so much of it, just on a flight. I look back to when I was 13, and I wish I had stuck with my piano studies.","I feel equal to Mexicans, Asians, everyone. That's the kind of positive message I want to get out.","I'm happy to race against anyone.","I love my ink. They all have a meaning. I'm very strong in my faith, so I wanted to have some religious images. I've got Pieta, a Michelangelo sculpture of Mary holding Jesus after he came off the cross, on my shoulder. A sacred heart on my arm. Musical notes because I love music. The compass on my chest is there because church is my compass.","I train to quite an intense level because Formula 1 is so physical - the G-forces, the demands on your body. Your heart rate is 150, 160 through the whole race. On qualifying lap, your heart rate can be up to 180, 190, under tough conditions.","If I'd won every single race and got pole everywhere, that would just be boring. It would suck. Where's the fun in that?","Lots of other drivers like cycling, but I'm not so keen. I have some really cool bikes, but I'm just not in love with it like Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso.","Generally, I hate training - just like most people, I guess. I try to make it fun and varied.","I really like to play to squash, because it's competitive, and I like basketball. I'm friends with a guy in L.A. called Andrew Bynum, who used to play for the L.A. Lakers NBA team. We play together sometimes.","We have to be extremely fit to race in F1.","I think it's a shame that people are so quick to put you in a box; sometimes it's as if you do one thing, and that's all you're allowed to do.","Equalising performance between teams runs completely counter to the idea of F1 and would be very unfair for us.","Formula 1 is the sort of place where people tend to have an opinion about everything, and usually, they tend to believe their own opinion is the right one, even if it relates to someone else.","I certainly lead a different life from many people. I have a great life that I am thankful for, and I like travelling.","If I don't travel, if I stay at home for a week, I would go out of my mind. That is just the way I am. I love to be on the move, and I am fortunate that I have friends all over the world.","Ayrton Senna was my favorite driver who I wanted to be like.","I started playing guitar when I was 13. I'd written a few songs on the guitar over some time. I'd written a book of poetry, and I got a book of lyrics that I had when I was a kid.","I relate my life a lot to 'Cool Runnings,' the movie.","I had a lot of racism growing up where I grew up. Bullied at school. It definitely encouraged me. It's like battle wounds - you come out the other side, and it just makes you tougher.","I genuinely have always had support from all of my team. I have never had any complaints from them.","Racing is very physical.","I like wearing things that other people wouldn't want to wear, to be a bit edgy.","I would love to one day have my own line of clothes.","It takes me forever to read a book. I have such a small attention span.","I don't like to read fiction. I like to learn something when I'm reading.","I don't drive by the seat of my pants and happen to win races. I work very hard to interpret the data and drive a certain way. My engineers have confidence in me, and more often than not, when I tell them what I need or what I am feeling with the car, it's right.","I want to crush everyone. I want to outsmart everyone.","I have the best job in the world.","I'm no less focused than any of my peers. They live a different life. They go home; they are not pictured at events. I train just as much as them, maybe more.","I have so much energy. I train, I travel, I'm learning about music and fashion, reading a lot. I don't want to miss anything. I want to experience everything.","I've accomplished more than I ever dreamed. But I'm hungry for more."],"Lewis Hine":["While photographs may not lie, liars may photograph.","If I could tell the story in words, I wouldn't need to lug around a camera."],"Lewis Howes":["One of the most powerful networking practices is to provide immediate value to a new connection. This means the moment you identify a way to help someone, take action.","Effective networking isn't a result of luck - it requires hard work and persistence.","Each day, we have the opportunity to learn something new, apologize for our mistakes, and become better.","I have learned that champions aren't just born; champions can be made when they embrace and commit to life-changing positive habits.","The road to profits is paved with unfair advantages.","The key to forming good habits is to make them part of your 'rituals.' I have a morning ritual, afternoon ritual, and Sunday ritual. It's one way to bundle good habits into regular times that you set aside to prepare yourself for the life you want. Rituals help you form habits.","When people are living from passion, they tend to be fulfilled, happy, healthy, and love everyone around them.","Goal setting should be part of your daily and weekly routines and should not be based on a calendar year or month.","You may confuse a lot of people when going against the grain of conventional thinking, and that's perfectly okay. As an entrepreneur, standing up for your vision to your family and friends might possibly be the best practice you will get for the life that awaits you.","Delivering a successful presentation could mean landing a major new contract, better prices for your services, or getting the funding you need. Failure can mean lost customers and a business that never gets off the ground.","Online leadership is about leveraging digital platforms such as blogs, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and other networks to build a loyal following of people who want to learn more about and benefit from your experiences and expertise.","Having a story is what people connect with, but the story alone doesn't allow you to achieve greatness and results. It's the day-to-day consistency of providing value to your audience.","Disruption starts with committing to excellence and taking a stand for your customer.","Your clients are critical to your business. Don't lose touch with who they are and why they've chosen to do business with you.","Instead of telling a story about how great your brand is, try telling a story that shows you completely understand and empathize with your customer and their life.","There isn't much room to get sick, be angry or unhappy when you do something you love all day.","I often speak publicly, and when I do, I also get to listen to other presenters. The most memorable are the ones that hit an emotional chord with a tight story and a punch line. No fluff. Keep it creative and concise. Greatness exists in quality, not quantity.","Staying consistent with positive habits can be a challenge.","Leaders are focused on using their vision and courage to do great things. This means challenging the way things are done and then sharing the journey with others.","The key in telling stories that people relate to is, not surprisingly, vulnerability and authenticity. That means that letting people know the struggle behind your brand - the failures and mistakes - and how you got through them is really important.","There's no way to become great overnight, but in the marathon of success, it takes a lot of intention to see you through each day of the journey.","Among the social networks, LinkedIn can be one of the most useful when it comes to cultivating critical, lucrative business opportunities, since it has a high concentration of business decision makers.","Entrepreneurs typically have an instinct for smelling opportunity, but that same killer instinct can quickly turn to weakness when it becomes a distraction from primary goals.","It can be easy to become 'friends' or 'connected' with someone in a digital world, but it requires thought and strategy to convert social media connections into rewarding business relationships.","As a business owner, leadership is more than just telling others what to do. Leadership is about the investment we make into others and the responsibilities we accept for being the voice and direction that others count on.","Instead of fearing the unknown - all the bad that can happen - realize that good things can surprise you as well.","What's your routine after attending a networking event or meal? If your answer is, 'I go home,' you're probably going to miss out on opportunities.","Chasing profits and building a long-term profit model are two different things.","I was in my 20s when I started writing my goals down, assigning each a date that I would achieve them by. I was amazed when I started reaching these goals by the date I had listed on them. It was a daily visualization exercise, and it almost always works.","The people and opportunities your business needs are out there, but the only way to uncover them is to take an active role in bringing your social network to life.","Sleep might be the most important aspect of building a great business, and having a high-performing body.","Social media is not the place to work out your problems with people.","The more content you share, the more opportunity people have to see it and engage with it.","Giving customers and prospects a glimpse into the entrepreneur's life and mindset can allow them to cultivate a deeper relationship with customers separately from the brand.","It's almost always easier to sell to an existing customer base than to find a new one.","While it may be difficult to get on the front cover of a major magazine, you can create marketing strategies and opportunities by being featured in a popular niche blog.","Entrepreneurs spend an inordinate amount of time inside of our own heads - thinking, analyzing, agonizing and obsessing over every little detail of our business. Sometimes, we need a break from ourselves. Meditation is a chance to let the thinking mind rest.","If you don't want to live a life where you go to a job every day just so you can enjoy your weekends and get two weeks of vacation every year, then don't do it.","No one cares about your logo, nor the font size that's on your site.","Successful people often enjoy telling their story.","Recognizing poor leadership is a vital skill to help you achieve greatness.","Just like football, business is a game of inches, where the smallest advancement or advantage can mean the difference between winning and losing.","One of the best and often overlooked traffic sources online is LinkedIn.","When beginning your entrepreneurial journey, acknowledge that you become a product of the five people you spend the most time with. So choose your company wisely.","Every great leader knows that his or her role comes with responsibility for those who follow him or her, and in ensuring they provide value in return for their loyalty.","People can see themselves in a story much easier than they can see themselves in a hypothetical situation that a brand might present to them. So telling stories to build a relationship with your audience is usually far more effective than other methods of marketing or publicity.","If you don't have the confidence to own the worth of your brand and share it unapologetically, you won't make a massive impact.","When I started my podcast, 'The School of Greatness,' one of the top three people I wanted to get on the show was Tony Robbins.","I'm a big fan of intention. That's because I have learned first-hand the power of setting my intention on my goal and making all decisions based off of that intention.","One of my favorite things about being the host of 'The School of Greatness' is that I get to learn from the best minds in the world about stuff I am fascinated by.","For me, managing my energy means slowing myself down before the big event. I slow down the racing thoughts in my mind. I concentrate on and slow down my breathing. I listen to and steady my heart rate.","If you can't be present when the time comes, then you may miss the opportunity.","You can manage your energy - just slow down and be.","In my perfect day, I wake up next to the woman of my dreams, and she's crying tears of joy because she's so excited about the life we have together. I'm preparing to compete in the 2016 Olympics with U.S.A. Team Handball, so I head to an intense training session with my coach to increase my physical strength and athleticism.","Every successful sports season I had included detailed daily itineraries. We received one in the morning and one before practice, and they set us up to win.","It took a lot of time and constant feedback to realize what wasn't working in my life, and it will be an ongoing journey until the day I die.","There have been many times when I was working out intensely and in the best shape of my life, and then, for whatever reason, I got off track. Before I knew it, 3 or 4 months would go by, and all of a sudden, I'd find myself exhausted halfway up a flight of stairs!","I think I just care about people, and I have a mission to support them to succeed.","Being a lifestyle entrepreneur is about building a business around your lifestyle rather than a lifestyle around your business. You need to figure out what your ideal lifestyle is first.","We all know a lot about something. We all have a passion about something.","Unfortunately, the higher you climb in social media, the more people will want to throw stones at you. But don't retaliate publicly.","When it comes to building your business and developing a powerful network, you'll want to develop a reputation as someone who highlights others. Not only does this give credit where credit is due, it also communicates that you're secure with your success and have the ability to promote others in your industry.","As funny as some photos can be, think twice about allowing yourself to be tagged in questionable photos.","When it comes to nurturing professional relationships and developing a community, LinkedIn is one of the best resources.","It doesn't take a lot of research to realize that the human eye is drawn to attractive things. So the better looking your LinkedIn profile is - meaning professional and complete - the more qualified you'll appear to your audience and the more interested people will be to check out your site.","The ability to network successfully can be one of the greatest assets in business. It allows some people to find incredible opportunities, while others just watch from the sidelines.","Apart from creating a vibrant branded Twitter account for your startup, business owners should consider creating their own personal account on Twitter. Fans and followers often want to connect with the person behind the brand.","If something catches your attention, it's probably going to catch the attention of others, too.","Everyone can benefit from seeing smart marketing.","Becoming an authority in your industry can be a great way to promote your business and help you better serve your clients.","New things get noticed. This means you can't be afraid to present something new to your market, even if it's just a variation or an addition to an already-existing product or service.","Don't allow people to suck up all your time with their questions or problems. Learn to say 'no' more often.","No matter how much you plan and prepare, things can still go wrong.","If you come across as boring or monotone, you're going to lose your audience.","There's no reason to feel embarrassed about presenting your product or service if it solves a problem.","While entrepreneurs spend a lot of effort trying to avoid failure, sometimes the lessons one learns from those missteps can be invaluable.","Many business owners dream of having their product or service endorsed by a global celebrity. But instead of trying to get a superstar to support your business, try seeking out a local celebrity instead.","Not only is a LinkedIn group free to create, it can enable you to offer your professional network a vibrant, useful information resource, all while driving traffic to your site and increasing sales.","As a leader, your job is to share your vision with your followers and either warn them of danger or highlight opportunities coming in the future.","Besides having an audience, the most important currency for any leader is his or her reputation. And having a reputation for over-delivering on what's expected of you should give your visitors, subscribers and customers more reason to spend their money with you and refer their friends.","Some of the most successful products are born from a personal need to solve a problem rather than a desire to turn a profit.","As a profession, entrepreneurship breeds anything but balance. The highs can be stratospheric, and the lows can be crushing.","Meditating is easier than most people think. Start by focusing and following your breath. The goal is not to eliminate thoughts entirely but to continually return to your breath. Taking this time to relax your mind can help sharpen your focus in other aspects of your work and allow you to work for longer periods of time.","As entrepreneurs, we already know our most valuable asset is time, but not every entrepreneur knows how to properly use that time.","I was a pain most of my childhood, always mad at the things I didn't have. Things shifted drastically in my 20s when I started putting an emphasis on gratitude. Focus on the good you do have, not the things you lack.","Yes, it's important to make things great, and you can certainly do this by upgrading over time, but good and profitable is better than perfect and never done.","Having even just one relationship with an online influencer can have a significant impact on your business.","Using social media can often be the fastest and easiest way to connect with online influencers because they are already established platforms for connecting with like-minded individuals.","When you are seen as someone who actively communicates with new connections, it can make other online users want to connect with you.","As a business owner, what's the sense in having droves of followers and connections if you aren't able to turn them into paying customers?","As a business owner who is looking to market his or her company, you should be on the lookout for opportunities to get face time with movers and shakers in your network.","I believe passion is the sword of love that pierces through the wall of fears that hold us back.","Coming from losing my dream of playing professional football, not having a college degree at the time and looking to jump into the business world at a young age was pretty daunting for me.","When you are competing for attention and eyeballs, articulating value and evoking possibility and vision can be powerful tools.","The world is awaiting your gift - all you have to do is show up with the right intention!","Action can cure fear and hesitation and doubt.","Poor leaders motivate those following them with false promises of promotions, success, and a great tomorrow but rarely deliver on those promises. Leaders who do this can be manipulative and often hold the goals and aspirations of their followers hostage in order to get them to comply.","The more confident you are, the less doubt you will have, and the more likely your success will be.","Before you can change your industry positively, you need to understand how to go about doing so.","Speaking can be a lot like exercise: The more time you spend getting ready, the more you mentally build the task into something larger than it actually is."],"Lewis Mumford":["A certain amount of opposition is a great help to a man. Kites rise against, not with, the wind.","However far modern science and techniques have fallen short of their inherent possibilities, they have taught mankind at least one lesson; nothing is impossible.","Our national flower is the concrete cloverleaf.","The chief function of the city is to convert power into form, energy into culture, dead matter into the living symbols of art, biological reproduction into social creativity.","To curb the machine and limit art to handicraft is a denial of opportunity.","A man of courage never needs weapons, but he may need bail.","Nothing is unthinkable, nothing impossible to the balanced person, provided it comes out of the needs of life and is dedicated to life's further development.","It has not been for nothing that the word has remained man's principal toy and tool: without the meanings and values it sustains, all man's other tools would be worthless.","Forget the damned motor car and build the cities for lovers and friends.","Restore human legs as a means of travel. Pedestrians rely on food for fuel and need no special parking facilities.","Today, the degradation of the inner life is symbolized by the fact that the only place sacred from interruption is the private toilet.","The way people in democracies think of the government as something different from themselves is a real handicap. And, of course, sometimes the government confirms their opinion.","Traditionalists are pessimists about the future and optimists about the past.","A day spent without the sight or sound of beauty, the contemplation of mystery, or the search of truth or perfection is a poverty-stricken day; and a succession of such days is fatal to human life.","Every new baby is a blind desperate vote for survival: people who find themselves unable to register an effective political protest against extermination do so by a biological act.","One of the functions of intelligence is to take account of the dangers that come from trusting solely to the intelligence.","The vast material displacements the machine has made in our physical environment are perhaps in the long run less important than its spiritual contributions to our culture.","Misery, mutilation, destruction, terror, starvation and death characterize the process of war and form a principal part of the product.","New York is the perfect model of a city, not the model of a perfect city.","Life is the only art that we are required to practice without preparation, and without being allowed the preliminary trials, the failures and botches, that are essential for training.","Without fullness of experience, length of days is nothing. When fullness of life has been achieved, shortness of days is nothing. That is perhaps why the young have usually so little fear of death; they live by intensities that the elderly have forgotten.","War is the supreme drama of a completely mechanized society.","In war, the army is not merely a pure consumer, but a negative producer.","War vies with magic in its efforts to get something for nothing.","Don't take the will for the deed; get the deed.","The cities and mansions that people dream of are those in which they finally live.","Every generation revolts against its fathers and makes friends with its grandfathers.","The artist does not illustrate science (but) he frequently responds to the same interests that a scientist does.","Today, the notion of progress in a single line without goal or limit seems perhaps the most parochial notion of a very parochial century.","The earth is the Lord's fullness thereof: this is no longer a hollow dictum of religion, but a directive for economic action toward human brotherhood."],"Lewis Tappan":["The Anti-Slavery public have generously responded to our appeal, and sent the means to enable us to fit them out well, to pay their passages, supply them with many useful articles and give the Missionaries money to sustain themselves for a while.","There is too much theology in the Church now, and too little of the Gospel.","We will persevere, come life or death.","If any fall by the hand of violence, others will continue the blessed work.","If you wish to draw off the people from a bad or wicked custom, you must beat up for a march; you must make an excitement, do something that everybody will notice.","You may imagine the joy manifested by these poor Africans, when they heard one of their own color address them in a friendly manner, and in a language they could comprehend!","The prisoners eyed the clothes some time, and laughed a good deal among themselves before they put them on.","Most of the prisoners told the interpreter that they are from Mandingo.","Indeed, the whole company, although thin in flesh, and generally of slight forms, and limbs, especially, are as good looking and intelligent a body of men as we usually meet with.","The African prisoners are orderly and peaceable among themselves.","They said their sufferings were great on the passage, and several of their number had died.","One of the men attached to the prison was the occasion of great amusement on the part of the prisoners, as well as the spectators, by taking a large lump of ice to show these strangers from the tropics.","The curiosity to see the prisoners appears to be unabated.","These meetings all have excited great attention, and have been of an exceedingly interesting character.","The event of the landing of these brethren upon our shores is to be, not without its beneficial effect, as well to the colored population of this country, as it promises to be to ill-fated Africa.","They have a fine breeze and are now we hope, well on their way."],"Lewis Thomas":["Given the opportunity, under the right conditions, two cells from wildly different sources, a yeast cell, say, and a chicken erythrocyte, will touch, fuse, and the two nuclei will then fuse as well, and the new hybrid cell will now divide into monstrous progeny. Naked cells, lacking self-respect, do not seem to have any sense of self.","We leave traces of ourselves wherever we go, on whatever we touch.","The cloning of humans is on most of the lists of things to worry about from Science, along with behaviour control, genetic engineering, transplanted heads, computer poetry and the unrestrained growth of plastic flowers.","Our behavior toward each other is the strangest, most unpredictable, and most unaccountable of all the phenomena with which we are obliged to live. In all of nature, there is nothing so threatening to humanity as humanity itself.","Statistically, the probability of any one of us being here is so small that you'd think the mere fact of existing would keep us all in a contented dazzlement of surprise.","Music is the effort we make to explain to ourselves how our brains work. We listen to Bach transfixed because this is listening to a human mind.","The dilemma of modern medicine, and the underlying central flaw in medical education and, most of all, in the training of interns, is the irresistible drive to do something, anything. It is expected by patients and too often agreed to by their doctors, in the face of ignorance.","Ants are so much like human beings as to be an embarrassment. They farm fungi, raise aphids as livestock, launch armies into war, use chemical sprays to alarm and confuse enemies, capture slaves, engage in child labour, exchange information ceaselessly. They do everything but watch television.","We live in a dancing matrix of viruses; they dart, rather like bees, from organism to organism, from plant to insect to mammal to me and back again, and into the sea, tugging along pieces of this genome, strings of genes from that, transplanting grafts of DNA, passing around heredity as though at a great party.","Of all celestial bodies within reach or view, as far as we can see, out to the edge, the most wonderful and marvellous and mysterious is turning out to be our own planet earth. There is nothing to match it anywhere, not yet anyway.","We are not made up, as we had always supposed, of successively enriched packets of our own parts. We are shared, rented, occupied. At the interior of our cells, driving them, providing the oxidative energy that sends us out for the improvement of each shining day, are the mitochondria, and in a strict sense they are not ours.","I won't compare ants and people, but ants give us a useful model of how single members of a community can become so organized that they end up resembling, in effect, one big collective brain. Our own exploding population and communication technology are leading us that way.","Animals have genes for altruism, and those genes have been selected in the evolution of many creatures because of the advantage they confer for the continuing survival of the species.","There's really no such thing as the agony of dying. I'm quite sure that pain is shut off at the moment of death. You see, something happens when the body knows it's about to go. Peptide hormones are released by cells in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Endorphins. They attach themselves to the cells responsible for feeling pain.","The future is too interesting and dangerous to be entrusted to any predictable, reliable agency. We need all the fallibility we can get. Most of all, we need to preserve the absolute unpredictability and total improbability of our connected minds. That way we can keep open all the options, as we have in the past.","We tend to think of our selves as the only wholly unique creations in nature, but it is not so. Uniqueness is so commonplace a property of living things that there is really nothing at all unique about it. A phenomenon can't be unique and universal at the same time.","If you want to use a cliche you must take full responsibility for it yourself and not try to fob it off on anon., or on society.","Most of the time I've worked in labs if I didn't encounter something in a week entirely unexpected and surprising I'd consider it a lost week. Lots of that is due to mistakes and stupidity, but it could open a new line of inquiry. Something really good turns up once in a hundred times, but it makes the whole day worthwhile.","Once you have become permanently startled, as I am, by the realization that we are a social species, you tend to keep an eye out for the pieces of evidence that this is, by and large, good for us.","A multitude of bees can tell the time of day, calculate the geometry of the sun's position, argue about the best location for the next swarm. Bees do a lot of close observing of other bees; maybe they know what follows stinging and do it anyway.","We habitually engage in meddling with nature. Until this century most of this meddling was good. Witness the preservation of the European countryside. But since then we've smoked it up and littered it and dumped too much in too many waters. I don't think it's our privilege to behave this way.","Much of today's public anxiety about science is the apprehension that we may forever be overlooking the whole by an endless, obsessive preoccupation with the parts.","It is from the progeny of this parent cell that we all take our looks; we still share genes around, and the resemblance of the enzymes of grasses to those of whales is in fact a family resemblance.","I suggest that the introductory courses in science, at all levels from grade school through college, be radically revised. Leave the fundamentals, the so-called basics, aside for a while, and concentrate the attention of all students on the things that are not known.","Human language... prevents us from sticking to the matter at hand.","The great secret of doctors, known only to their wives, but still hidden from the public, is that most things get better by themselves; most things, in fact, are better in the morning.","We are, perhaps, uniquely among the earth's creatures, the worrying animal. We worry away our lives, fearing the future, discontent with the present, unable to take in the idea of dying, unable to sit still.","It hurts the spirit, somehow, to read the word environments, when the plural means that there are so many alternatives there to be sorted through, as in a market, and voted on.","Sometimes you get a glimpse of a semicolon coming, a few lines farther on, and it is like climbing a steep path through woods and seeing a wooden bench just at a bend in the road ahead, a place where you can expect to sit for a moment, catching your breath.","We are built to make mistakes, coded for error.","Any species capable of producing, at this earliest, juvenile stage of its development... the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, cannot be all bad.","If we are to be destroyed we will do it ourselves by warfare with thermonuclear weaponry.","A lot of people fear death because they think that so overwhelming an experience has to be painful, but I've seen quite a few deaths, and, with one exception, I've never known anyone to undergo anything like agony. That's amazing when you think about it. I mean, how complicated the mechanism is that's being taken apart.","My father was a doctor, and I admired him and got along well with him. He took me with him on house calls. We were living in Flushing, which was then a sleepy village of 25,000 - before the subway got there. I've been sure I wanted to be a doctor since I was about 12.","I don't want to be reincarnated, that's for sure. When you've had rewarding experiences in your life - a loving family, friends - you don't need additional reassurances that you're going to do something with a new cast of characters. I'd just as soon pass.","I don't think that the permanence of the individual human soul is an indispensable part of religious thought.","Doctors, dressed up in one professional costume or another, have been in busy practice since the earliest records of every culture on earth. It is hard to think of a more dependable or enduring occupation, harder still to imagine any future events leading to its extinction.","The earliest sensation at the onset of illness, often preceding the recognition of identifiable symptoms, is apprehension. Something has gone wrong, and a glimpse of mortality shifts somewhere deep in the mind. It is the most ancient of our fears.","Medical knowledge and technical savvy are biodegradable. The sort of medicine that was practiced in Boston or New York or Atlanta fifty years ago would be as strange to a medical student or intern today as the ceremonial dance of a !Kung San tribe would seem to a rock festival audience in Hackensack.","The most solid piece of scientific truth I know of is that we are profoundly ignorant about nature.","As a species, taking all in all, we are still too young, too juvenile, to be trusted. We have spread across the face of the earth in just a few thousand years, no time at all as evolution clocks time, covering all livable parts of the planet, endangering other forms of life, and now threatening ourselves.","We are not like the social insects. They have only the one way of doing things and they will do it forever, coded for that way. We are coded differently, not just for binary choices, go or no-go. We can go four ways at once, depending on how the air feels: go, no-go, but also maybe, plus what the hell let's give it a try.","At this early stage in our evolution, now through our infancy and into our childhood and then, with luck, our growing up, what our species needs most of all, right now, is simply a future.","It is only when you watch the dense mass of thousands of ants, crowded together around the Hill, blackening the ground, that you begin to see the whole beast, and now you observe it thinking, planning, calculating. It is an intelligence, a kind of live computer, with crawling bits for its wits.","Survival, in the cool economics of biology, means simply the persistence of one's own genes in the generations to follow.","The uniformity of the earth's life, more astonishing than its diversity, is accountable by the high probability that we derived, originally, from some single cell, fertilized in a bolt of lightning as the earth cooled.","The need to make music, and to listen to it, is universally expressed by human beings. I cannot imagine, even in our most primitive times, the emergence of talented painters to make cave paintings without there having been, near at hand, equally creative people making song. It is, like speech, a dominant aspect of human biology.","In the fields I know best, among the life sciences, it is required that the most expert and sophisticated minds be capable of changing course - often with a great lurch - every few years.","The central task of science is to arrive, stage by stage, at a clearer comprehension of nature, but this does not at all mean, as it is sometimes claimed to mean, a search for mastery over nature.","Very few recognize science as the high adventure it really is, the wildest of all explorations ever taken by human beings, the chance to glimpse things never seen before, the shrewdest maneuver for discovering how the world works.","Worrying is the most natural and spontaneous of all human functions.","It is a distortion, with something profoundly disloyal about it, to picture the human being as a teetering, fallible contraption, always needing watching and patching, always on the verge of flapping to pieces.","We're as clever as we think we are, but we'll be a lot cleverer when we learn to use not just one brain but to pool huge numbers of brains. We're at a level technologically where we can share information and think collectively about our problems. We do it in science all the time - there's no reason why we can't do it in other endeavors.","Well, biology today as I see it has an amiable look - quite different from the 19th-century view that the whole arrangement of nature is hostile, 'red in tooth and claw.' That came about because people misread Darwin's 'survival of the fittest.'","Having long suspected that there was something alive in there, running the place, separate from everything else, absolutely individual and independent, we've celebrated by giving it a real name. My self.","We are told that the trouble with modern man is that he has been trying to detach himself from nature... In this scenario, Man comes on as a stupendous lethal force, and the Earth is pictured as something delicate, like rising bubbles at the surface of a country pond, or flights of fragile birds.","We can take some gratification at having come a certain distance in just a few thousand years of our existence as language users, but it should be a deeper satisfaction, even an exhilaration, to recognize that we have such a distance still to go.","We carry stores of DNA in our nuclei that may have come in, at one time or another, from the fusion of ancestral cells and the linking of ancestral organisms in symbiosis. Our genomes are catalogues of instructions from all kinds of sources in nature, filed for all kinds of contingencies."],"Lewis Thompson Preston":["It is the quality of lending over the quantity of lending.","Alleviating poverty would be the Bank's overarching objective.","Applications for loans would be judged on a nation's social justice record as well as its economic efficiency."],"Lex Luger":["Many times, the decisions we make affect and hurt your closest friends and family the most. I have a lot of regrets in that regard. But God has forgiven me, which I am very thankful for. It has enabled me to forgive myself and move forward one day at a time.","No matter what we face, put your total faith in God, and in time - not our time, but His time - He'll bring us through.","I thought surrendering was a weakness; instead it's the strongest thing a man or a woman can ever do, to acknowledge our Creator who's in control of all things.","I was trying to be 27 at age 47, but God had to get rid of my vanity. I had trouble letting go of the old Lex physically. My human fleshly nature didn't want to let go of what had come to be billed as 'The Total Package.' I guess God had to help me get rid of the last remnant of that vanity and pride.","I just want people to know out there no matter what they've done, God doesn't judge us on how many sins. God is there for us. He loves us. He wants us to turn it over to Him.","I used to be known as one of the strongest guys on the planet.","I want to thank the fans so much for their support through the years. Even as undeserving as I was, they were a big part of my being able to move forward and put my life back together. They're the greatest. They're the ones who make the stars. For their support throughout my career and today, I love them and thank them.","I just want people to know out there no matter what they've done, God doesn't judge us on how many sins.","One of the things I do is try to get a positive message out there in the local schools and tell my story. I also do a lot of faith-based speaking, sharing my story and testimony, to help show what God has done in my life and what he can do in others' lives.","I'm involved in quite a few ministries as a bridge builder, trying to match generous givers and donors to other ministries. Based on my past, I'm also involved in mainly the prison ministry. I go to jails and prisons and share my story, trying to give them some hope.","I grew up in Buffalo, New York, and was a big Bills fan.","When I saw that Wrestlemania had broken an indoor attendance record, I just walked into a wrestling office, Championship Wrestling in Florida, during the offseason, and they introduced me to Hiro Matsuda, who became my mentor... and the rest is history!"],"Lexa Doig":["Being stuck in airports, you always end up buying perfume and sunglasses.","I'm totally on a mission to find my signature scent, but I'm too mercurial.","Men with style are great because they have a sense of self.","I was actually a bit disappointed about the amount of sex in the show. I think Backus should get out a bit more, get a relationship, perhaps make her a lesbian.","It doesn't take much to make me happy.","My most recent purchase was a black lace corset.","Seppuku is Japanese for ritual suicide. I thought, What a cute name for a coat.","Thongs don't show. With jeans, you're always going to get panty lines and I think that's just a big mistake.","For the past 10 years, people have been making fun of the eighties. Why are we bringing them back?","I did some artistic nudes when I was I 8 with a French-Canadian photographer while I was modeling. They were beautiful shots, and they were not about nudity.","I do see myself going to LA. Not anytime soon.","I had cleavage that would make Dolly Parton proud. But those things are really heavy and I'm pretty slight of frame, so I took them out. No one even noticed.","I like breaking the rules.","I quite enjoy science fiction.","I sit on my duff, smoke cigarettes and watch TV. I'm not exactly a poster girl for healthy living.","I thought I wanted to be a brain surgeon until I realized all the schooling it required. I didn't like school very much so I had to come up with something else.","I toyed with the idea of pursuing a career as a lawyer just because I like to argue.","I was taken to one place by a director, and he bought me a lap dance.","I'm determined to be a diva.","I'm off to save the universe again. It's a tough job but someone has to do it, and I'm glad it's me.","I'm so much more of an East Coast girl than a West Coast girl.","I'm very proud to be Canadian, but I would move to New York in a heartbeat.","It doesn't matter if you're staying at a four-star hotel, you will never have your whole closet with you.","It's a dream part, running around with guns, being an agent.","My parents used to take me to a lot of theatre when I was young.","My relationships with my loved ones always take precedence over work.","Thank God my parents had an abundance of patience.","The idea of running around and screaming about Jason Voorhees trying to kill you was fun.","The idea of taking off my shoes and trying on all these clothes is so exhausting, I just leave.","The thing about Canada is, you're not really considered a Canadian actor unless you do something with the CBC."],"Lexi Thompson":["I wear pink on Saturdays for breast cancer, and I wear blue on Sundays. I'm superstitious. At the Evian tournament in 2010, in which I came in second, I wore baby blue on a Sunday. And ever since then, I've worn it every Sunday. Puma sponsors me, so I wear all their outfits in bright colors. I wear matching hair ribbons, too.","You go through slumps in this game, and you just have to work through them. You're going to miss putts out on an LPGA tour and have bad rounds. You just have to think to yourself that you always have tomorrow, and you're lucky enough to be out here just playing golf for a living.","I'm a big breakfast person: Eggs, bacon and yogurt is my go-to meal before a round. On the course, peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches are great for energy, but a protein bar works, too.","Sometimes, it just gets mentally tough, but at the end of the day, I'm playing golf for a living. And reaching out to a huge fan base and knowing people are following my progress and looking up to me means the world to me. So if all I have to do is some photo shoots and answer questions, that's nothing to me. That's part of my life.","My driving and irons are the best part of my game. Growing to be 5-foot-11 has certainly helped.","I go to the movies, and I watch MTV and the Disney Channel. I admit I like 'Hannah Montana.'","I have always looked up to my brothers. They are a huge influence on me. We constantly text and Facebook each other to give each other support. And we all hang out at home when we are in town together.","I really enjoy being with my fans. They offer great support and encouragement to me. I like signing autographs and posing for pictures.","I love my sponsors. They make things so much fun for me. We do really fun and exciting things, so I always have a blast. It doesn't ever seem like work.","I've always used a mallet putter on tour. I get too much face rotation with a blade.","I met Taylor Lautner and Jonah Hill at the 'Today Show.' That was pretty cool.","I started with golf because I saw my brothers play, I was always watching them. It was my life. Growing up, we always played competitions like chipping, hitting.","Since I've been home-schooled since sixth grade, I've practiced six to seven hours a day. I wake up, practice for three hours in the morning, eat lunch, and then go out and play eighteen or more holes.","I like upbeat songs, and I listen to a lot of Linkin Park and Green Day. I also like hip hop and R&B artists such as Drake and Rihanna.","I started golfing at a young age, and growing up with two older brothers, it made me mature a lot younger.","I'm not a huge shopper. I love looking good - obviously, on the golf course I like looking sharp, that's for sure. I'm just not into knowing brands.","I'm pretty much on all social media, but Instagram is the coolest, and I use it the most because I take a lot of pictures and I like to post them, but I link them all to each one."],"Leymah Gbowee":["I have come to one conclusion: All that I am, all that I aspire to be, all that I was before, is by the grace of God. There are so many women in Africa, and outside Africa, who are more intelligent than I am.","Leadership is standing with your people. People say you have to live to fight another day, but sometimes you have to show you are a true leader.","The one thing I have never been afraid of is standing before important people and speaking my mind. I represent women who may never have the opportunity to go to the UN or meet with a president. I'm never afraid to speak truth to power.","There is something in this world that every individual can do. God has created all of us with something unique to contribute.","I'm a serious optimist. I come from a country where you have little to be hopeful for, and so you have to always be an optimist.","I always tell people, anger is like liquid. It's fluid, it's like water. You put it in a container and it takes the shape of that container. So many people you see in prison, unleashing war on their people, they are angry, and they take their anger and put it into a violent container.","I'm now on a journey to fulfill the wish, in my tiny capacity, of little African girls.","At 17, the first time I saw a dead body, I froze. By 31 it was a natural occurrence for me, and no group of people should live like that.","If you are serving justice to one person, those who have been affected should also be served some form of justice."],"Li Bingbing":["The threat of extinction is more real than many realise. And the damage done to elephants directly leads to destruction of the ecosystem.","Illegal killings of elephants are being linked to organized crime and the funding of armed militia groups. Many consumers in Asia do not realize that by buying ivory, they are playing a role in the illegal wildlife trade and its serious consequences.","It is difficult to understand why I am so famous. I never thought I wanted to be an actress. I never thought about it. I think it is my destiny to be in this business.","Actually, for me, I really love to do action movie. You know, most people, they know, they thought that I am a martial artist. I don't know why, but I love to do kung fu movie, you know?","I started out as a music teacher; I never planned on becoming an actress.","I got into the Shanghai Drama Institute because my parents, like all parents, want their children to have good grades and to go to a good college. I became a college student because of them.","My first time playing a main character was in 'Seventeen Years.' It was directed by famous Sixth Generation director Zhang Yuan, but it wasn't a large commercial film.","I often hear actors say during their interviews: 'I want to play a crazy person, a murderer, or someone who's on edge.' But that question scares me. I mean, of course there are characters I'd like to play, but I can't really say specifically who they are. It's much too hard to play a convincing normal person as it is.","I'm happy to see the United States and China cooperating more and more with movies. The entertainment industry in China is developing very fast. I hope there can be a bridge for actors to work in both places."],"Li Ka-shing":["We are approaching a new age of synthesis. Knowledge cannot be merely a degree or a skill... it demands a broader vision, capabilities in critical thinking and logical deduction without which we cannot have constructive progress.","Vision is perhaps our greatest strength... it has kept us alive to the power and continuity of thought through the centuries, it makes us peer into the future and lends shape to the unknown.","The future may be made up of many factors but where it truly lies is in the hearts and minds of men. Your dedication should not be confined for your own gain, but unleashes your passion for our beloved country as well as for the integrity and humanity of mankind."],"Li Keqiang":["Changes call for innovation, and innovation leads to progress.","We live in a global village. No country can live in isolation of others like Robinson Crusoe.","It is fair to say that Africa has become a major force in moving the world towards multi-polarity, an important emerging market that helps promote global economic recovery and integration, and an outstanding representative of diverse civilizations in the world.","We can't have it so there are skyscrapers side by side with slums.","Smog is affecting larger parts of China, and environmental pollution has become a major problem, which is nature's red-light warning against the model of inefficient and blind development.","Those who refuse to reform may not make mistakes, but they will be blamed for not assuming their historical responsibility.","No matter who you are or what you intend to do, you should not exceed the boundaries of the rule of law.","In this Internet age of shared information, even if you don't tell the people, they will find out.","Stable growth ensures employment.","I believe that the United Kingdom can stay at the forefront in leading the world's growth and development and also continue to play an important and even bigger role for regional stability and global peace.","There are many countries in the world that when they reached the middle-income stage, they witnessed serious structural problems such as growth stagnation, a widening wealth gap and increasing social unrest.","China and India are friendly neighbours. We are also natural partners. Both of our countries stand for amicable and peaceful relations between countries and a multipolar world. The peaceful and friendly relations between our two countries is a blessing not just to Asia, but to also the whole world.","I'm afraid sometimes certain individual cases of defaults are unavoidable. What we should do is to step up monitoring, properly handle relevant matters, and ensure there is no regional and systemic financial risk.","As a developing country, China needs a favorable neighbouring and international environment for its modernisation.","The market is the creator of social wealth and the wellspring of self-sustaining economic development.","China's reform and opening-up programme and Europe's integration process have both contributed significantly to global peace, development, and prosperity. China firmly supports the integration of Europe and regards the E.U. as a strategic partner that deserves our confidence.","Urbanization is not about simply increasing the number of urban residents or expanding the area of cities. More importantly, it's about a complete change from rural to urban style in terms of industry structure, employment, living environment and social security.","I was a student at Peking University for close to a decade, while a so-called 'knowledge explosion' was rapidly expanding. I was searching for not just knowledge, but also to mold a temperament, to cultivate a scholarly outlook.","Openness has been vital to Asia's fast growth in the past and it will continue to be crucial for the area's further development.","Governments at all levels and the whole society should act more vigorously to protect the land our lives depend on.","Reforming is about curbing government power. It is a self-imposed revolution; it will require real sacrifice, and it will be painful.","We need to leave to the market and society what they can do well.","In the past, proactive fiscal polices almost always meant just more investment and an increase in the fiscal deficit.","Ultimately, stable growth will ensure that urban and rural incomes increase and people's lives improve.","We must keep prices under control to ensure that price increases do not exert a major negative impact on people's lives.","When neighbours interact with each other, it is only natural that sometimes they will run into problems of some kind or another. As long as they respect each other, properly manage differences, and pursue mutual benefits, there will be harmonious sound instead of jarring noises.","No matter how senior an official is, if he violates party discipline and the law of the country, he will be seriously dealt with and punished.","The growth that we want is one that brings real benefits to the people, raises quality and efficiency of development, and contributes to energy conservation and environmental protection.","Many people in the world believe that in the 21st century, the Asia-Pacific - Asia in particular - will play a more important role in global economy and politics and that Asia will become an important engine for the world economy.","China is not looking for a trade surplus but wants to import more French goods.","Development and prosperity of the world cannot happen without the simultaneous development of India and China.","In my view, Asian countries have learnt the lessons from the past and significantly enhanced their capabilities to fend off risks.","China is still a developing country with a myriad of tasks and challenges.","In fighting the debt crisis, E.U. countries have enhanced co-operation and carried out reform with tremendous courage. This is laudable.","When 'designed in Europe' is combined with 'made in China' and when European technologies are applied to the Chinese market, there will be amazing results.","The world today needs both western thinking and oriental vision.","The term 'Xiaokang' is used today to refer to a society where people can receive education, get paid through work, have access to medical services and old-age support, have a shelter and more than enough food and clothing, and lead a well-off life.","China's development benefits other countries.","With its population making up one fifth of the world's total, China offers a market with enormous potential.","China is committed to work with other countries for a solution to the global challenge of energy and resources.","When I visit local communities, people often complain that they need the approval of several dozen government departments to get something done or to start a business, and people are quite frustrated about this.","The world today is anything but trouble-free.","China not only does not support hacking but also opposes it.","The Chinese economy has huge potential and flexibility.","India and China have not shied away from addressing boundary questions, have wisdom to find a fair and mutually acceptable solution... We have been able to put all issues on the table.","I want the voice of developing countries to be stronger.","Poverty and backwardness in the midst of clear waters and verdant mountains is no good, nor is it to have prosperity and wealth while the environment deteriorates.","Innovation is the running theme and spirit of the policies adopted by the Chinese government, and it is the banner that we will always hold high.","Africa has a time-honored and brilliant civilization.","The African people and tribal chiefs are hospitable, and African music and dances are invigorating.","China-Africa relationship has a long history and is full of vitality. Since the 1950s and 1960s, our common historical experiences have brought China and Africa together, and we have forged deep friendship in our joint struggle during which we have supported each other in times of difficulty.","In pursuing reform, we have to navigate uncharted waters. We may also have to confront protracted problems because we will have to shake up vested interests.","China continues to welcome foreign investment, and the door will open even further.","Reform is 'the biggest dividend' for China.","Since entering the new century, China and Africa have seized the historic opportunities presented by the deepening of globalization, worked together and helped each other to achieve a win-win outcome.","I wish to reiterate solemnly China's continued firm support to Pakistan in its efforts to uphold independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.","China-Pakistan relationship is indeed special because it transcends the changes of the times and politics and represents a fine example of friendly state-to-state interactions.","When it comes to Pakistan, the first word that comes to the mind of the Chinese is 'iron brother.' To us Chinese, Pakistan is always a trustworthy friend who is as solid as iron. Actually, Chinese netizens refer to Pakistan as 'Iron Pak.' This testifies to the strength of China-Pakistan friendship.","Pakistan is the first South Asian country to sign a free trade agreement and currency swap agreement with China.","When there's downward pressure on growth, one choice is to adjust economic policy, increase deficits, relax monetary policy. That might have a short-term benefit, but may not be beneficial for the future.","Enterprises of different ownerships should all enjoy fair opportunities and conditions to compete in the market."],"Li Lu":["In my view, the biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital. Not only is the mere drop in stock prices not risk, but it is an opportunity. Where else do you look for cheap stocks?","Everyone has blind spots, and even the brightest people are no exceptions.","Management is always part of the equation of making the company successful, so the quality of management always matters.","When I first came to Columbia University, I was dirt poor. I did not choose to come here - I just ended up here because I had nowhere else to go, having just escaped from China after Tiananmen. I was in a new country where I didn't understand the language, didn't know anybody, and didn't have a penny to my name. So I was desperate and afraid.","I grew up in Communist China and never had much money to my name, and then, all of a sudden, I had giant student loans.","Part of the game of investing is to come into your own. You must find some way that perfectly fits your personality because there is some element of a zero sum game in investing. If you buy, somebody else has to sell. And when you sell, somebody has to buy. You can't both be right.","The game of investing is a process of discovering who you are, what you're interested in, what you're good at, what you love to do, then magnifying that until you gain a sizable edge over all the other people.","No dictatorship can be sustained within the context of an information revolution.","Rock and roll was a revelation for me.","Whatever you are is because of what your ancestors have done.","To us, anyone who opposes dictatorship is our friend. Those who support it, our enemy.","Politically, China suppresses its people, but because the government allows some freedom in economic matters, business has become the ultimate expression of individuality.","Tiananmen did not fail.","Free market never succeeded without free men and free society.","You can't imagine a free market coupled with a dictatorship.","Mao Zedong's way was to make people crazy. It was like a religious cult.","The whole thing is, really, money makes money. That's the whole thing about capitalism. Without the capital, there is no -ism.","With free market and free man, if you remove one of them, it is not called capitalism in my dictionary.","Without a free man, there is no free market. That's called exploitation.","I was a college student in 1989 when I participated in the demonstration at Tiananmen Square. I was one of the organizers.","I was born and grew up in China during the 1960s.","Only by a process of peaceful evolution can China accomplish its own goals of being a free, prosperous, and strong country.","I think we Chinese are just as capable, as diligent, as hardworking, as peace-loving, and as creative as people everywhere.","Management always has a big influence on your success, no matter how good or how bad the business is itself.","Investing is about intellectual honesty. You want to know what you know. You want to know, mostly, what you don't know.","Investing is about predicting the future, and the future is inherently unpredictable. Therefore, the only way you can do better is to assess all the facts and truly know what you know and know what you don't know. That's your probability edge.","I was born in April of 1966, on the eve of the Cultural Revolution. Soon after, my parents and grandparents all lost personal freedom simply for being intellectuals. So I spent most of my childhood rotating between adopted families of peasants and coalminers.","At various stages in my life, I could have stopped, or took the long rest. For some reason, my heart told me otherwise. I just kept going. Half of the time, I wasn't sure where I was heading. The other half, I was probably taking the wrong turns. No matter.","I have three lovely children. They are beautiful, talented, and kind-hearted. I'm most proud of them. I love them so much that I will never want to burden them with a large amount of inherited wealth.","In my 40s, the two cultures finally came to peace with one other inside me, and I have come to identify myself as both 100% Chinese and 100% American simultaneously.","The financial crisis of 2008-09 was in large part the result of the so-called 'success' of people who did not understand their fiduciary duty. This kind of 'success' is extremely harmful to all of society.","All companies incur expenses, some of which are fixed and bear no relation to sales volumes. In this way, profits can grow at a faster rate than sales.","For the vast majority of mankind's history, economic activity consisted of finding energy and using energy.","I graduated from Columbia University in 1996 and founded my investment company in 1997, thus starting my professional investment career.","A 'competence' that has no defined borders cannot be called a true competence."],"Li Na":["In badminton, they use a lot from the wrist. But I use a lot from the shoulder.","I would prefer to have no money but to have a nice family and good friends around.","I felt sad because everyday I had to wake up early to practice before going to school. After school I had to go back to tennis again, and then after tennis I had homework. I didn't have time to play.","Tennis is best of three sets, so even if I lose the first set, I still have a chance.","The first time I showed the tattoo, it was big news in the newspaper: 'She has a tattoo with a snake.' It's not a snake.","If I didn't do well at Wimbledon maybe Chinese people will forget about me.","I love New York City.","People in China say: 'If you love your children, send them to New York. If you hate your children, also send them to New York.'","China tennis - we're getting bigger and bigger.","I never thought I could win the French Open.","Just because you win the French Open it doesn't mean you can do well at Wimbledon.","I don't need to worry about being idolised.","I'm married. Who cares about me?","I just feel exciting.","I feel like my whole life only tennis.","I would like to say now I was very enjoy the life right now.","When I got into the sport I was so fat that my manager said he should send me to boot camp to lose the weight!","I look forward to competing.","Of course, after I retire I want to be the housewife, really.","If I have children, after school they'll always feel happy energy in the home.","I don't know how many years I can still play. I have to listen to my body and see how it feels.","I really do not think about 'Oh, right now I have to defend those points and this title.' I just really want to enjoy playing on the court, in front of the fans.","It's always tough when you're fighting with your husband on the court.","I think because I was the first Chinese player to win a grand slam, people were thinking: 'She's not like normal people.'","The woman's tour is very tough for all of the players.","It was a big decision to leave the system because many people said I would fail.","I always had a powerful serve. It's one of the best in women's tennis. It's very good to have a weapon like that.","Of course you're nervous going into a final.","I just keep fighting and try to be the last one standing.","I've played in a lot of big matches and you learn from them.","The weather for me is nothing special. The weather couldn't kill me.","I need some time to recover. I'm not a machine.","I think players changing coaches is normal.","I just follow my heart.","I'm still happy, I like this life.","People know what I'm doing.","When you do one thing, people think it's right or wrong. Maybe half-half.","I do what I want."],"Li Ning":["The external world is changing drastically, and enterprises and products will have a short lifecycle if they don't change. So we have to react to market trends. Nothing lasts forever in today's world.","O2O and all-in-one systems mean we have to make online and offline inventory accessible to each other. This is complicated both in terms of the technical aspect and in cost. A story sounds wonderful, but if it is too costly, it is not good. Technology has to match business.","Any company faces big challenges during transformation. People are accustomed to going ahead on the existing track. Even when they know there are problems, the first reaction is to protect the old way.","In the environment of the mobile Internet, there is value and need to explore every commercial context. What I care about is not just technology but the changes in people's behavior in this environment, which makes it possible that everyone can get connected with everyone else."],"Li Peng":["As a historical legacy, the Kashmir conflict has been an outstanding issue for more than half a century.","At the beginning of the new century, it is the common aspiration of the peoples of the two countries to deepen mutual understanding, enhance trust, develop friendship and strengthen cooperation.","We are ready to engage in international co-operation against terrorism with a view to safeguarding national interests and regional security and stability.","In the spring and summer of 1989, a serious political disturbance took place in China.","Comrade Deng Xiaoping - along with other party elders - gave the party leadership their firm and full support to put down the political disturbance using forceful measures.","China and India are close neighbours linked by mountains and rivers and the Chinese and Indian peoples have enjoyed friendly exchanges for thousands of years.","Today, being the biggest developing countries in the world, China and India are both committed to developing their economy and raising their people's living standards.","When President Jiang Zemin visited India in 1996, the two sides decided that they would jointly build a constructive partnership of cooperation oriented towards the 21st century.","I am firmly convinced that, in future years, China and India will join hands in playing a more active role in maintaining peace and stability in the region and the world at large and make due contribution to the cause of human progress and development.","China has always maintained that all countries, big or small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are equal members of the international community and they should stand and speak in the world as such.","Ours is a colourful and diversified world. It is also a complex one.","People of all countries have the right to choose their own social system and road to development in the light of their national conditions and characteristics.","There are nearly 200 countries and a population of over 6 billion in today's world. International affairs should be addressed by all countries through consultations rather than monopolised by a few powers.","Since the end of the Cold War, hegemonism has become increasingly unpopular.","Multi- polarisation has become an inevitable trend in the process of shaping a global political pattern and has been widely welcomed by the international community as it reflects the common interests and aspiration of the overwhelming majority of countries.","A multi-polar world can not exist without recognising the status and participation of developing countries.","In the new century, we should continue to work together to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the vast number of developing countries including China and India and promote the establishment of a just and equitable new international political and economic order.","Normal military trade is undoubtedly part of the normal State-to-State relations.","We have reiterated on many occasions that China wishes to establish and develop long-term, good-neighbourly and friendly relations with all countries in south Asia.","We sincerely hope that south Asian countries will respect and live in amity with each other, and achieve common development, and that south Asia will enjoy peace, stability and prosperity.","We support every effort to combat international terrorism through the formulation of international conventions and hope that the international community will take further steps to improve the anti-terrorism international legal framework."],"Li Shufu":["Volvo has one weakness, and that is in the interior design. They have not adapted to the Chinese people's perception of luxury when it comes to the interior design, and this has to be addressed.","We lived in a farm village, and no one could afford to buy a car or to fly. We were envious. We couldn't afford any toys. I couldn't imagine making a real car.","In general, what we want to do is to elevate Volvo's brand positioning, and we feel the main lever to achieve that is to develop more higher-tier products.","Design is very, very critical for the success of the car. We want to find the distinctive features for Chinese cars on the world stage.","Volvo is like a mysterious, beautiful woman. We just look at her from far away, amazed. We don't dare get close to her. We're just a bunch of farm boys.","We realized you cannot create a car by simply gathering needed components.","I believe the auto industry is a competition of human resources, competition of funding, competition of technology - and the competition is international.","Life is a question without a standard answer.","Getting silver and gold out of junk machinery was quick to be learnt by others.","I believe the auto business is a highly comprehensive and complicated business. It's not that easy for people simply to enter and ruin the whole thing.","Particularly in China, I think a lot of people start to realise, OK, what are the things that they truly should value? That's something that fits perfectly well with what Volvo is offering.","Chinese... companies do not have to think about whether they do something to enhance their competitive edge in international markets.","In this fast-developing world, particularly in the fast-transforming China market, we really need to take this opportunity and offer a modern interpretation of Scandinavian design which fits people's demands perfectly.","Product investment, quality management, and all the things that are key for a car company - great, there has been no compromise in those aspects. But I feel there's a lot we could do on communication, particularly from a Chinese perspective.","No matter how hard we work, there is always a gap with Western brands.","I hope to buy brands and businesses globally.","Chinese entrepreneurs have to implement their work under the leadership of the Party and the government - it is very clear.","We will do whatever the government tells us to do, which is a critically important principle of the Chinese market economy, and there is nothing more for discussion about it.","I think it is definitely right to listen to the Party and follow up government's instructions.","We carry out our work under the leadership of the government.","Our dream is to see Geely vehicles driven all over the world.","We are not selling the black cab in large enough volumes. We want to expand globally."],"Li Yuanchao":["The Internet was invented in America but has found its largest number of users in China.","Surfing the Internet every day has become a habit for many leaders and officials, including myself.","The Chinese have a habit of reading. Many families regard books as the most valuable family asset."],"Lia Ices":["I'm giving into my tendency to want to blur and blend the lines between art and life, and privacy and sharing.","I think sitting behind a keyboard can be a security blanket.","I gave in to the idea of paying attention to what you like and letting it help you make better stuff.","I can be super reclusive and hermetic, and then I can be in California and host dinner parties and drink wine. It's all me.","Something I've learned is that it actually takes a lot of work to make something great.","Being in a space that's not a studio, it kind of creates an openness of 'We can do whatever we want here; we're not on the clock.'","I'm definitely using different parts of myself, but I think when it comes down to words and melodies, I can't really force anything too much.","When I got back from London, I started with a new voice teacher in the experimental wing, who trained me to have my own artistry as opposed to forcing a technique upon me.","The fact that I could sing in a way that might not be right for RADA but is right for me was a brand-new concept.","In every song, there is a vocal element that doesn't have any words. I wanted to play around with how emotive and expressive my voice could be.","Touring is a whole other animal for me and a whole other skill. But I'm having a lot of fun figuring all that out and switching it from internal to external and putting on a show.","I can play piano, and I write everything on piano, but I don't really feel like a piano player, necessarily.","I'm not really good at anyone's songs but my own.","I think that being in an extreme natural setting, and letting the natural world and what it's doing permeate your thoughts, is super-interesting and super-important.","I realized that there was much more to my voice than I'd ever been led to explore and that I could make my own songs."],"Liam Aiken":["I've never really tried to copy anyone; I like to have my own style.","I hang out with the 'nerdy' people - they have a different sense of humor than most kids.","Shortly after my dad died, my mom figured that if I could do a few commercials, I'd get a college fund."],"Liam Cunningham":["I hate the unfairness of injustice. Anybody who thinks they are better than others or 'chosen' or feel they have an entitlement... be it through monarchy, government or money. I think we are all born the same. We are entitled to an equal shot at life.","What makes us different from other species is our capacity for compassion and empathy with the struggles of other people.","'Game of Thrones,' people say that it's a fantasy series, but it's a hell of a lot more than that. It attracts the so-called geeks and nerds, and God bless them, they're wonderful for getting right into the show. But primarily it's about family; it's power and betrayal and jealousy. It's all those wonderful things that a fantastic drama is about.","Good luck to you if you're lucky enough to have faith. Some of us aren't lucky enough. My mother has great faith and finds great comfort in it, and I'm jealous of her!","I was an electrician, and now I'm in 'Electric Dreams.' It's almost bizarre.","Paris is cafe culture, Dublin is pub culture, and that's the best place to solve all the world's problems: over a pint! One of the great joys of living, I think. The problems of the world seem to disappear.","I love onions. I cook with them all the time.","I wasn't interested in being an actor per se, but I liked acting, and I liked seeing what people would do.","I still say I have no interest in being an actor - I just love acting.","I love my arthouse films, and I love taking a chance.","There's an old actor's saying about how you don't work with children or animals. I disagree with both of them. Some of the best times I've ever had were working with kids because there's an honesty to them.","The attraction of power is heady, addictive. And as we know from real life, it can be a disease. A horrific disease.","The best kind of art or writing holds up a mirror to society.","The best kind of television should mess with your head.","The best thing you can do to an audience is to make them work.","I don't feel superior because I think there's no God. Actually, I would love to be able to go, 'Well, the world hasn't been kind to me, but there's something good around the corner, because the Man has a plan.' I wish I believed that. There's wonderful comfort in that.","If anyone gets arrogant about their religion, that's when the religion isn't effective anymore. Any decent religion or any decent philosophy is always about tolerance and individual freedom, not about harm.","One of the biggest guys I worked with was Sean Connery. People like Sean, Michael Caine, Denzel Washington, they've been going for a long time, and not for nothing. They want to get this job right, and they realise the weight of responsibility on their shoulders.","Because I came to acting quite late, I kind of think one of the few attributes that I do have is that I try to be honest with the character, with the writing. I'm not a tricksy actor; I'm not exactly a scenery-chewing kind of actor.","A person has already made the effort once they open a paper or turn on the news. They want to know what's going on in the world around them. That, in itself, shows they care. But the problem is, most people say, 'That's terrible,' and then move on. Because they find it too difficult to look at.","Let's just shatter the illusion. I am not wealthy. I've lived in the same house for the past 30 years.","I get that people are worried about their mortgages and bills that have to be paid. They don't have time to worry about the Syrian refugees, and I get that. The thing about it is, when it gets worse and worse and worse and down the line, it's no longer restricted to these places.","If you're doing movies on a set... many times, I've shot the end of a movie in the first week of shooting. Because of locations or budgets or actors' availability.","There's a certain amount of joy in playing a character in the moment and not knowing what's going to roll out as it goes on. It's a bit like life, in a way.","You always have to have a bit of fun if somebody is dead in a scene. That's a red rag to a bull for an actor. You do a little poking. You do things to annoy the actor. It's your job. You have to utilize the opportunity. You have to get through the day.","I've never done a big series like 'Game of Thrones' before. All I knew was that it was HBO, and I'd seen what they had done with 'The Sopranos' and 'The Wire.' But when I started reading the script, it was a no-brainer. Yes, yes, yes. Gold. Every time I turned the page.","I've always admired people like Donal McCann. He wasn't a household name, but if he put his name to something, you were guaranteed a good yarn at the very least.","You have to look for story. That's obvious. If that's not on the page, you can forget it. But I also read whatever character I'm being offered. And if you can cut them out without it affecting the story, then I say no straight away.","I was an electrician, and I started acting as a hobby because I needed a distraction - I was bored! And only when I started did I think, 'Sheesh, what have I gotten into?' I had to go after it fully; I just had to.","On a job, there's so much commitment you have to give, in regards to time, research... I like the tunnel vision of it that prevents anything else from getting in. The creativity and collaboration required there is very rewarding.","I think everybody should have an interest in peace prevailing and the ridiculousness, the bestiality of war. I don't have any time for that. Anybody pulling a trigger is wrong. There is no right in war.","I'm an inner city man, born and bred.","I've always loved movies, so I tried to get into an acting school. I saw an ad for the Oscar school on the back of 'The Irish Times,' and I went along for an audition, very pragmatically, to see if I could do it or not.","I had no acting background in my family and no experience of theatre. I hadn't even been in a school play.","I'd always admired Sean Connery. Even though I wonder about some of his choices, I like him even in bad movies.","I work like a dog when I have to, but when I'm not working, I get terribly lazy and could sit around all day.","I've got loads of ideas, but I need some structure in my life. I need a mission.","I live an odd existence. I dip into bizarre, very expensive worlds, and then I'm back with a bang to reality, and I put the bins out.","I suppose I am a bit of rough. I'm originally from Coolock: I'm rough around the edges.","I was walking home from school when I was about 17 with two friends, and they took a left into an electrical shop. While we were chatting away, they grabbed a couple of forms and I was handed one. My mum found it and made me fill it in. I got called for an interview, and that's how I ended up being an electrician for 11 years.","I don't consider myself - and I hope I'm never going to be - a 'movie star.' I'd like to be called an actor.","If I was offered the choice of an award for best actor or best supporting actor, I would go for supporting actor.","I've found that the older I get, the more spontaneous I become.","The way I view drama is life with the boring bits taken out.","The demonization of people who don't have a voice is particularly despicable, and the only thing we can do in our own little way is hold a mirror up to society and kind of say we're better than that.","When 'Games of Thrones' is finished, I'm not one to go on about it too long and rest on one's laurels. The stuff that interests me is the work.","I was so hungry when I started attempting acting. Not even to be a professional. Just to find out if I could act.","I did a season at the Royal Shakespeare Company. People say, 'Why aren't you doing theater anymore?' And I say, 'Look, my kids have gotten used to wearing shoes.'","The superheroes have taken over all the screens in the world. And good luck to them: they're making a lot of money for a lot of people. But the studios are going to become victims of their own success. People are going to get bored with that stuff.","I've spent a lot of years waiting for the right thing to come in - and now, after 'Thrones,' there's a possibility that I could actually have a hand in getting something made.","I think HBO and a couple of the other cable channels in America are making some of the best television that's ever been made.","Whether it's theatre or TV or film, you're hoping you're going to bump into a writer that's got a bit of honour in him, that wants to tell a good story and is able to tell it well.","It's not beyond me to take my kids to see a good popcorn movie that's a roller coaster ride.","The only thing an actor can do is, whatever lands on the carpet in the hall, you read it, and if you can't put it down, that's the job to do."],"Liam Fox":["If Iran becomes a nuclear weapon state it is the end of non-proliferation as we know it. If Iran gets a nuclear weapon you are likely to see Saudi, Egypt and other countries follow suit and we will bequeath to the next generation a nuclear arms race in the world's most unstable region.","There is a difference between a military mission and the aspiration for the long-term plans for the country. What we want is a stable enough Afghanistan, able to look after its own security so we can leave without the fear of it imploding... But let's be clear - it's not going to be perfect.","But while we can never predict where events will take us or the unavoidable bills we will have to pay as a consequence, we must confront the ghastly truth of Labour's legacy.","New Labour was the most short-sighted, self-serving, incompetent, useless, and ineffective government that Britain has ever known. Make no mistake, Labour's economic policies were a national security liability.","We will continue to be a big contributor to NATO and our interests will be more secure.","We can't afford to see Afghanistan roll backwards into a failed state that could become a base from which terrorist campaigns can be launched anywhere in the world.","We are not in Afghanistan for the sake of the education policy in a broken 13th-century country. We are there so the people of Britain and our global interests are not threatened."],"Liam Gallagher":["Everyone knows that if you've got a brother, you're going to fight.","I was walking along and this chair came flying past me, and another, and another, and I thought, man, is this gonna be a good night.","I live for now, not for what happens after I die.","I don't like jeans with holes in 'em. I like 'em faded.","I am a tender, beautiful and loving guy that happens to slap a photographer now and then because they get in my way.","I'll never have a stylist.","I don't know what any of my songs are about. I don't sit down to write about anything. They're about whatever you want. I don't pick subjects. I just start.","There's no rules. Show me the rule book.","Not everyone can say, 'I'm going to write a classic today.' If that was the case, we'd all be doing it.","She can't even chew gum and walk in a straight line, let alone write a book.","It's about the music and that's it. I'm not an entertainer. But I do entertain people, see what I mean?","Lennon was right. And we are bigger than Jesus. We will be as big as the Beatles, if not bigger.","If I like something, I get it and I put it on.","I didn't always want to be a dad.","I refuse to dance. And I can't dance anyway. I'm not in a band for that.","I find words really hard.","I'm into the girls fancying me and stuff, mad for it.","Discipline? I don't know the meaning of the word.","You've seen one of the our gigs you've seen 'em all. But if you're into the music, you'll know that we played better the night before or we can play better.","I need them, need them to give me a kick up the arse. Otherwise I'd just be sat-in getting fat, counting me money. It's good people living on your doorstep and looking through your bins. Gives you energy.","Americans want grungy people, stabbing themselves in the head on stage. They get a bright bunch like us, with deodorant on, they don't get it.","I'm not looking for guidance.","I'm not going around touring the U.S. when I've got nowhere to live.","New York is my favorite city in the world.","I've got to be by trees, otherwise I get claustrophobic.","My favorite album would have to be something from The Beatles.","I want to be in the best band in the world again.","The idea of sitting at home, not making music, just makes me want to throw up.","You've either got it or you haven't.","Being a lad is what I'm about."],"Liam Hemsworth":["I feel like anything I'm doing in life, I try to stay myself and be as honest and true as I can be, you know, and be a nice person. I've always been taught to be kind to people and have an open mind about life.","If I have one addiction in life, it's probably food.","Volleyball was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.","Most of the time, if I'm in a pickle, I'll call one of my brothers. They've usually got somewhat uplifting advice. One is six and a half years older and one is eight years older, so they've probably lived through whatever my problem is.","There is a time and place for publicity, but to stay a sane person, you must have a personal life.","I feel like it's the most boring thing, sitting on the treadmill or on a bike. It just explodes my mind!","All women think men look good in suits. To be honest, I like the way they look, too.","I love my brothers' kids. It's funny - as an uncle, you become so protective of them.","I don't generally hang out with crazy people.","I grew up in a good family with good parents, and I was able to dream big and have the support to live it out.","Sushi is my favorite thing to do in L.A.","Tomorrow doesn't exist, yesterday is gone. The more I remind myself of that, the stronger I feel.","How comedic are squirrels? We don't have squirrels in Australia. The first time I saw a squirrel was at a meeting at Disney.","I love junk food.","My character's kind of grown up with Katniss. The beginning of the story, they're more or less brother and sister than anything. They're best friends. They've been keeping each other alive. It's a little frustrating, for the character. As the character, not as me.","One of my favorite movies is 'A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints.'","We had a black bear on the 'Hunger Games' set, and that was a little scary.","I love going to the gym, sweating, running around, feeling like I'm having a heart attack.","I was a naughty kid.","As the younger brother, I think you always have crushes on your older brother's girlfriends.","We're showing a situation that these kids are caught in and being forced to do but the violence is not glorified. Most of the kids in there are not wanting to be doing it.","The people that live in these districts, they don't want to watch it. They don't want to see their children die or killing other people. The only people that it is entertainment to are the people in the capital that have been brainwashed and are misguided and living in a completely unrealistic kind of world.","If we get to shoot the third one, which I'm really hoping we do, the third one's great. There's a big uprising and rebellion, and my character Gale's a big part of that. If we get to shoot that, I'll be very, very pleased.","The fans that I have met so far have been nothing but supportive and extremely passionate about the books. I feel so honored to meet all these people. Something like this, which I think is bigger than anyone in the film, it's pretty crazy.","At this point, I'm happy to be part of something special. As an actor I liked to choose scripts that I'm passionate about.","We love making movies. We got into the business to make movies. At the end of the day, whether you're doing a low budget film or a big budget film, you want it to do well and you want people to see it. That's the whole point. You want to put some kind of message in it.","I learn more with every job, and I'm very thankful for where I am.","I go down to Newport and Huntington a lot. It's more crowded than where I grew up on Phillip Island, but I think it's helped me adjust to life in America - getting into the water as much as I can.","I feel like the books were just written like a movie. You read it and you can just kind of see everything. Before I went in to read with the director, I read the first book and I loved it. I didn't realize how good the writing was. And then I went in and read with Gary Ross, and that was it.","We shot in a place called Asheville, which is like beautiful, beautiful forests. And then part of it we shot all the reaping stuff, which was just crazy - because the reaping in the book and in the script is such an emotional thing for everyone. It really did feel like that when we were shooting it.","Gary Ross is amazing. He's just - he always has a billion ideas of what he wants, but has a very clear perspective also; he just makes it work. He really does. He's trying different things and making everything look amazing.","Gary Ross is amazing.","We all make mistakes, and it's not until we make mistakes that we learn.","I think a lot of stuff like people's emails getting hacked or that an email you sent is stored on a hard drive somewhere, that kind of stuff worries me a little bit. It's a weird thought that someone else could get into my information that easily. That stuff's pretty scary.","I hate that there'll be moments in my day and I'll be patting down my legs trying to find my phone. I hate how anxious it makes me feel when I don't have it. When I go on holiday, or I go back to Australia, I put my phone in my bag and I don't worry about it; I think differently and I feel less stressed.","Honestly, I really, really love making movies. It's so much fun, and I love losing myself in the moment and just being there with other actors. When you're truly in the moment and you're feeding each other, it's such an exciting thing to be a part of.","Honestly, I'm not an extravagant person; I don't spend a lot of money.","I don't spend a lot of money on myself, really.","'The Hunger Games' takes place in Panem, a country which is part of America. It's post-apocalyptic. There's been a global war. The Panem country is what remains of this hugely destructive war.","I've worked with little kid actors before, and when they start crying or anything like that, it makes my job so easy, because you react. A little kid crying, there's not much else to do.","I love watching my brothers raise their kids and not have to do it for myself and have the responsibility.","I know I'm a good person.","I get a little scared sometimes. A lot of things scare me.","My dad worked for child protection.","For a few years, I went down a path where I forgot to be in the moment and enjoy the moment.","Southern people remind me a lot of Australia.","The first few years in L.A. were really tough and scary, but I had to figure things out for myself.","I read a lot of Zen books. And I grew up surfing, so that has always been my escape.","My uncles used to call me 'Devil Child,' or 'Triple' for triple six. They used to tell my brother Chris that they were going to get the demons out of him because he was also a little crazy. But to me, they'd just be like, 'You're too far gone. There's no exorcising you anymore.'","I work with accent coaches a lot and try to do my best to get the Australian out of there.","I love New York. It just reminds me of so many movies... I look up at buildings, and feel like Godzilla should be climbing up them or something.","I grew up close to Melbourne, about two hours outside, on Phillip Island. It's really small; it's kind of a little summer beach town.","If you put the work in, and you show that you're willing to work hard, you'll succeed.","I think when people see photos of you out and about in your personal life, they assume that you've asked for it or that you want that attention, but I don't think anyone in their right mind asks for that kind of thing.","I surfed competitively from age 13 to 18. Every day, before and after school. I wanted to surf for the rest of my life. It's what all my friends did - I even had it as a subject in school for a number of years.","Ninety percent of my best friends back home are plumbers, electricians, builders, or landscapers. Most of our dads worked in trades.","It's 'The Hunger Games.' My character needs to look hungry. A little bit.","I love fried food.","When I'm boxing, if my career isn't going well, at least I feel mentally and physically strong.","I played a paraplegic on a show called 'Neighbours.' Just turned up on set, sat in a wheelchair. The producer came up to me one day and said, 'We have to cut around that entire scene because your leg was moving.'","I think when I started acting, the whole time I was working towards one day coming to America. Hollywood, in particular, is seen to be the center of this industry, and I was just waiting for the right time to come.","I love getting into physical shape for a film; it makes me feel more like what the character needs to be.","I'd love to do action-y types of films; you know, as long as they're good stories.","My favorite actors are Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio and Will Smith - guys like that.","I like getting my feet massaged; I'll get whoever's closest to do it.","I studied cooking all through high school.","I'm a really fast runner. No one can catch me - I'm quick.","Harrison Ford comes on set, and he's very polite and says, 'Hello' to everyone. He cares about everything that's going on, on set. He cares about what's going on with your character and what's in the scene and what's on the desk.","John Malkovich is such an interesting person and such a fun actor to work with.","I read as many scripts as I can and just find stuff that I think is interesting, find stories that I think are worth telling.","I'm pretty outdoorsy!","I had four films one year that were supposed to happen and didn't.","I don't sing. I played guitar for a while. I'm not great, I'm not Lenny Kravitz by any means, but I do like to strum.","I just live my life.","If I was to get turned down by a girl, I'd just give up and say, 'Oh well.'","Personally, when I'm not working, I like to do as many things outside of the industry as I can - other things that make me happy. You kind of need to be grounded in something else besides just being an actor.","Growing up, I lived a moderate lifestyle with my family.","Acting is a tough business to break into.","The hamburgers in America are the best in the world.","Mel's Diner in L.A. - they are my favorite hamburgers. I could eat there every day. They are ridiculous.","Most of my friends surfed, so we would go before school, after school - literally, whenever we could.","I don't lift weights.","I like suits that are fitted. And I usually stick to grays, whites, and blacks.","I used to wear my brothers' hand-me-downs, which were all too big on me.","I used to have an afro - like Will Ferrell in 'Semi-Pro.' It was bleached blond from the sun. I was tall and awkward. I was not cool."],"Liam James":["I've seen 'Fried Green Tomatoes' too many times. I love life stories told in flashback.","A local newspaper where we were filming in Boston called me the Justin Bieber of Canada. I don't think they realized Justin Bieber is from Canada. I hope someday I can just be the Liam James of Canada."],"Liam McIntyre":["I never thought I'd be an expert at sword fighting, I never thought I'd be an expert in protein powders - I'm close to being an expert in both. It's great!","As a younger actor, my motivation may have been 'Do you want that job or don't you?' Now it's 'Do you want to look like crap on film?'","I've always been stubborn.","I don't like losing.","I don't like failing at anything.","Every actor dreams of getting a big break, a big opportunity.","As an actor, you never try to be someone else. You can't."],"Liam Neeson":["It's an ongoing joy being a dad.","In real life, wolves will do anything to avoid contact with mankind.","I'm still a proud Irishman, of course, but I've become an American citizen. I'm very, very proud of that.","Every cliche about kids is true; they grow up so quickly, you blink and they're gone, and you have to spend the time with them now. But that's a joy.","I'm a big believer in acts of kindness, no matter how small.","I try to stay fit. I try and do something every day but I don't jog. My body hates jogging.","For all of nature's wonder and beauty, it is also hostile and unpredictable.","A sex symbol? A symbol of sex? I don't think that I am a sex symbol, although it's very flattering. I'm 59, now, so I think I'm possibly past my sell-by date. I think I am.","People ask me if I ever feel outside the Hollywood loop, and I never do, because both of us do a lot of theatre, so it's great for New York and it's also half-way between Europe and the west coast, so it's the best of both worlds.","I think I survived by running away some. Running away to work.","I do shadow boxing and use a heavy bag, but I don't spar with anyone.","I don't do my own stunts, but I do my own fighting. I don't consider fighting to be a stunt.","The Irish Catholic side was married to the life of an actor and I found out acting could be a form of prayer.","I was very slow in maths, geometry I actually enjoyed.","I'm Irish, so I'm used to odd stews. I can take it. Just throw a lot of carrots and onions in there and I'll call it dinner.","There seems to be more opportunities for old guys like me to do a little fighting and running because the lead characters also require a bit of depth and maturity and gravitas that one is likely to acquire doing drama all those years.","I've had an unbelievable life. I've been very lucky. You do create your own luck too, you know? I never forget where I'm from. Whenever I pass a building site or see somebody digging a ditch, I always think, 'That's real work.'","I love doing my own stunts but it's hard.","I certainly notice the vitality in Belfast, which wasn't there in the Seventies. There was a war going on then. Now there are cranes everywhere. There really is a sense of renewal and hope.","For every successful actor or actress, there are countless numbers who don't make it. The name of the game is rejection. You go to an audition and you're told you're too tall or you're too Irish or your nose is not quite right. You're rejected for your education, you're rejected for this or that and it's really tough.","Some mornings you wake up and think, gee I look handsome today. Other days I think, what am I doing in the movies? I wanna go back to Ireland and drive a forklift.","But I was very, very lucky, and it was a wake up call as far as motorbikes are concerned. I never flirted with death on the bike, but now I'm totally convinced they're death machines.","It's best to keep acting real.","Yeah, well, I finally stopped smoking for good.","Well, I think they're all basically the same story. Every culture in the world has them. When you strip it down and analyze it, it's the young man or girl who goes through a trial or ordeal and hits a very low ebb but manages to get guidance from a Merlin type figure.","I always wanted to be a cowboy, and Jedi Knights are basically cowboys in space, right?","It's interesting, the more successful you become the more people want to give you stuff for nothing.","Hollywood is throwing action movies at me.","I think I'm past my due date. I just feel it.","I try to be a hard boiled sometimes. My kids see right through it. I'm acting. It's always, 'When I say you'll be back at 11, that means 11, not 11.15. Do you hear me!?' Then, 'Yeah, Dad.'","But, you know, there's still an argument, there's still ten states that outlaw premarital sex, and many more states where adultery is still outlawed and a crime.","To be honest, I'm scared to death of rollercoaster rides.","Before 'Schindler's List,' I wouldn't have believed movies had a lot of power for social change.","Acting is invigorating. But I don't analyse it too much. It's like a dog smelling where it's going to do its toilet in the morning.","In Los Angeles, it's like they jog for two hours a day and then they think they're morally right. That's when you want to choke people, you know?","Acting with creatures that aren't there is kind like acting with an actor who refuses to come out of his trailer. You still have to go on and do the scene.","And as the hour approached for the execution, in his own mind, Collins became both the executioner and the victim. He would pace up and down, transformed in almost a kind of exorcism when he knew he was responsible for taking someone's life.","And the Institute sent me a little film footage of Kinsey himself preparing to do an interview for television to talk about his work, so that was quite valuable for me.","At the Sex Institute in Bloomington, Indiana, they were a phenomenal help, too. We went out there for a few days, and they gave us access to materials. And the biographies, there are four or five, ranging from very poor to excellent.","But let's just say, I'm Irish. I grew up in the 1950s. Religion had a very tight iron fist.","But, you know, sex is controversial, it just is and it always will be.","Getting married and settling down isn't the most important thing in my life.","I did, although I didn't read from page 1 to page 187 but I read chunks of it. I did a little bit of science when I was in the university so I was able to understand the graphs and pie charts and stuff like that. It was extremely dry.","I love working with children and this young boy, Thomas Sangster, is quite a remarkable young actor. He raises your game, you know. He certainly raised mine.","I thought, well of course, Kinsey absolutely adored teaching. He was a wonderful teacher. So these kids really inspired me. So that was a clue I hung onto. He loved young people, he absolutely loved them. And he loved teaching them and trying to help them.","I'd like to play Ian Paisley, actually. I'd need building up, though he's very frail now.","I'm not the kind of actor that would know what my character had for breakfast last Tuesday.","In bed at night, I could be reading some book, and I'll come across a sentence that's totally unrelated to some scene I did years ago. But I'll play the scene back in my mind and think, I did that wrong - I should've opened the door more slowly.","It's extraordinary to look into a baby's face and see a piece of your flesh and your spirit. It makes you realize you are a part of the human race.","Kinsey's quest was really for us all to be tolerant and accepting of each other.","Sitting down to eat in our house is about sharing, you know, talking about the day you've had, be it in school or work or whatever, so that's very important to us.","Well I think people think sex is controversial. Not always, but certainly it's something to be discussed.","Well I was on the jury duty on the Deauville Film Festival, a few years ago.","Well, from an acting point of view, I bear no relation, I don't look like Alfred Kinsey at all, but I thought somewhere in my artist's soul, my actor's soul, I could capture something of the spirit of the man.","Well, I think I've made 44 films and only like four times I've played real characters I'm just drawn to people who have a pioneer spirit, this extraordinary energy and commitment to their cause.","Yes, I'm Catholic; I'm proud of it. But I had lots of Protestant friends.","I was reared a Catholic but I think every day we ask ourselves, not consciously, what are we doing on this planet? What's it all about?","I'm constantly reading books on God or the absence of God and atheism.","I don't know if I'm a strict parent or a pushover.","Rihanna is a very talented person. One of those people who are able to do whatever they want with great results.","I never thought about becoming a professional singer, but I am in touch with Bono about releasing a musical movie. It will be about an Irish band during the '70s who are looking for fortune in Las Vegas. I should play the singer of the band but I don't want to sing in front of anybody.","I will never become a director or a movie producer. I was always looking at picture directing because I didn't know what to do! You can't be a movie director without real preparation.","Why would anyone ever tell anything personal to a journalist?","I get fed up with plots that are driven by someone constantly getting information on a computer.","I have no desire to play King Lear or Hamlet. I never had a grand ambition. I just followed my nose.","I had done some flimflam movies, but I didn't understand what being an actor meant anymore.","I offer my performance as prayer for someone I've worked with as an actor or someone who has died. The image that comes into my head as I walk to the stage, I offer that performance up for that person.","The putting on of vestments and lighting candles, it's a wonderful ritual that never changes from one Mass to another.","I was an OK boxer, I wasn't great, I was OK, but I loved the discipline of getting together every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, usually Saturday afternoons too, with a whole bunch of mates and training, very, very hard for about two-and-half hours.","If I get rejected for a part, I pick myself up and say, 'OK, not today, maybe tomorrow I'll get this other part or something.'","I have often found that no matter where I meet people in the world, there is a path that leads back to Queen's.","Queen's University flies the flag for the arts in Northern Ireland and beyond.","I have to make it my job to be careful with my family.","It's easy enough to plan jobs, to plan a lot of work.","Indeed I regard the enduring support which I have received over the years from all sections of the community in Ballymena as being more than sufficient recognition for any success which I may have achieved as an actor.","It is fun to explore these kick-butt characters.","I came to water late. I learned to swim at the age of 20.","I keep fit as much as I can.","I have friends who have daughters and there's times I think I'm glad I have boys instead of girls.","I don't think I'm funny.","As you know, Hollywood loves to pigeonhole all the actors and actresses, and suddenly I got 're-pigeonholed' as an action actor.","Looking out for your children is an ongoing process throughout your life.","I'm trying to be a comedian, you know?","You think your life is going one way and then suddenly, you're on another track.","It's funny, but you get to a time in your life when you think you have all the friends you will ever have.","I do believe at the end of the night when you're with your family, the character gets hung up on the door like a coat, and is there to be taken on the next morning.","I've made many films and only a few times I've played real people.","I think if you're the son or daughter of successful actors and actresses, it's a double pressure. More is expected of you.","I don't think that I am a sex symbol, although it's very flattering.","I'm so touched that complete strangers will send me a script asking me to be in their film. That still amazes me - and sometimes for a lot of money too.","I think there must be some other life forms, even if they're microscopic.","I gravitate toward women.","I can always act.","I loved school.","I've never been in a street fight.","America has been very, very good to me.","I'm very much a homebody.","You can't act being a boxer. It's like being on stage.","When I see great boxers, it's like reading a wonderful poem.","It's an extraordinary thing, this tiny little province of Northern Ireland, where carnage happened. And I was part of it. I grew up in it.","I love working with children."],"Liam Payne":["I had a few dating disasters along the way with girls cheating on me. One girl was the inspiration for me singing 'Cry Me A River' on 'The X Factor.' That was my payback to her because she was unfaithful.","People sometimes ask if I want to be a solo artist, but it just wouldn't be any fun being on your own.","It's so amazing to hear a crowd of people singing one of your songs. It's the best feeling.","I'd just like to be able to walk outside as everyone does and enjoy time with my friends, not feel bad for not wanting to take a picture.","The feather was a thing, when I was a kid, we used to find feathers around the house, and whenever we found them, my mum used to say it was my nan leaving them around for us to find, so that was quite sweet.","I was born three weeks early, and I kept being ill. From the age of zero to four, I was always in hospital having tests done, but they couldn't find out what was wrong. They discovered that one of my kidneys wasn't working properly, and it had scarred. I had to have 32 injections in my arm in the morning and evening to try and make me better.","It's important to have a life outside the band.","I've still got both kidneys, but one doesn't work, so I have to be careful not to drink too much, even water, and I have to keep myself as healthy as possible.","I had a test on my kidneys a few weeks back and found out I have two.","I was ill. I was told I was stressed, so I had to get everything checked out. I didn't think I was, but someone told me I was. As a result, I went to get a blood test. I'd never had one before, so I held my breath when I was getting it done. That caused me to go into a fit.","I think sometimes I don't realise how much the pressure gets to me.","I was bullied by a few people who were much older than me. I went to camp to learn boxing. I was 12, and my coach was 24. I felt like if I could fight him, I could stand up to anyone.","I was always called Payne or Payno.","I think I've changed a little bit. I don't know whether it's for the better or for the worse at the moment. I've settled into a different mind frame now... being a bit wilder maybe!","We've always described our sound as a bit more guitar driven than normal pop music. Kind of Pink in a boy band form. We've heard a few people say that so now we use it. I think Pink is amazing person to be compared to.","Let's just say I haven't been keeping up the Gary Barlow persona; I've let loose.","I listened to a lot of Jay-Z and Kanye coming up, which would be unexpected for a boy bander like me. But I'd listen to a lot of that, and a lot of Ed Sheeran, actually.","When you have more than two people working together, it gets a bit unfocused as an idea.","I think the whole thing, boy band, it's a little bit of a dirty word. They say it's not a good thing to be in a boy band. We want to change that. We want to make the boy band cool. It's not just about dancing and dressing the same.","When I was born, I was effectively dead. Weird, I know. The doctors couldn't get any reaction from me, so I had to be brought round, and although it seemed like I was okay, there were underlying problems.","Being a fan of someone's show and the way they still hold a family together doesn't mean I am OK with all they say.","I really liked one girl and asked her out 22 times, but she always said no. Finally I sang to her, and she said she'd go out with me.","On our American tour bus, the bunks are a bit taller so that we don't bash our heads. On the English bus, we bash our heads every morning. It's not the best thing to do first thing when you wake up.","Please don't throw phones. They hurt. And we sell them on eBay.","I'm doing a two-hour show every day, so you can eat what you want.","When I think about it, I do start to worry about this whole social media thing. It does make me uncomfortable; kids should be out, living their lives, getting out and enjoying themselves."],"Liam Smith":["I'm a humble guy, I'm pretty down to earth.","I don't need any more motivation. I'm fighting Canelo Alvarez. If that can't get me motivated, then I'm in the wrong sport.","If Canelo comes too hard at me early, he's going to be in for a long night.","Kirkland and Khan are chinny fighters. I am not like that.","When I was fighting at a weekend, I would be in when my friends were out. I never had time to go out and go off the rails.","I don't care who's in front of me; nobody is going to stop me from winning the world title.","I've seen Thompson before, as I keep my eye on everyone in the division, as I might one day fight them.","I've been laughing with my brothers about it. Paul and Stephen both won the British title before me, but I'm going to be the first world champion in the family.","We used tea towels for gloves until we got proper ones and were always breaking our mum's ornaments. She'd come home and find us all sat in our boxer shorts, out of breath and our skin red raw. She hated it.","Growing up with my brothers all boxing has stood me in good stead for nights like these. You should have seen some the fights we used to have in our front room.","From my point of view, I am the underdog going into this fight. I'm not saying I'm not. But I'm the underdog because I haven't fought at that level yet against anyone of Canelo's level.","I'm not going to say I'm not ready for a fighter like Canelo Alvarez.","I'm world champion, so if I'm not ready for another fighter at 154, I don't deserve to be world champion. That's the way I look at it and what I firmly believe.","Once I will arrive in the ring, I'm going to make the most of this fight because this fight I will remember for the rest of my life. From my point of view, this night is going to be remembered by the British people. Not from the American people as much, but from the British fans here who will watch me beat Canelo Alvarez.","I'm not stupid. I know on paper I'm the B-side of this fight. Canelo's the big name.","It's always Canelo, and it's Mexican Independence Day, so I know that. But I am the champion, and just looking back on that, that is one reason why I hope they'll respect that I'm champion and be fair.","Give me the respect I deserve.","Canelo's the big name, but I am the champion going in... I took this fight. I'm not in a situation where I have nothing to lose in this fight. I've got a title to lose.","I'll go for the knockout, and if we have to go 12 rounds, then I'll trust the judges to do their best work, and I will get the victory if I deserve it.","Canelo isn't a full light-middleweight like I am, and that's to my advantage.","Canelo's going to have his moments. I'm not saying he's not. But I'm going to have my moments. It will come down to who can finish off their moments and finish the fight the best.","I don't want to be chasing a big, awkward southpaw around the ring. I want a fight that people will enjoy.","I made my debut on October 10, 2008, so it'll be seven years to the day that I could become world champion. That's a massive night to be crowned.","Thompson is a typical American: wide feet, good jab; he'll try to have a fight.","Everyone breeds success off each other.","As soon as I get in a rhythm, I'm very hard to stop.","I'm still a mummy's boy!","A lot of things come down to your roots and how you're brought up.","My mum will never let me be anything but grounded.","I'm not just coming here for a payday. I'm not an old guy at the end of my career looking for a payday. I've got a title to keep.","I'm confident a good Liam Smith beats a good John Thompson.","I remember when Joe Calzaghe fought Jeff Lacy, and there was all this hype about Lacy being some sort of unbeatable force, and Joe absolutely hammered him.","I won't watch that Amir fight from now until I fight Alvarez. I'm not a blown up 147 or a Miguel Cotto. I'm a big 154 lb., and I'm coming of age and coming to win.","Before British title fights, I've played football on a Saturday before; it's silly as it is.","When I was 17 or 18, I realised I could do something with boxing.","My mum says part of the reason we moved house, it was a rough area at the time, was down to that - they wanted to help me.","If you ask anyone who my mum's blue-eyed boy is, they will say it is me.","Now Mayweather has retired, Alavrez is the biggest name in boxing, and I'm looking forward to pitting my wits against him.","People say I'm not world level, but I haven't fought at that class yet, so you can't say that until I have.","I don't want to say 'grateful.' I don't want to sound like I'm just coming for the opportunity and to say I boxed in front of this many people at AT&T Stadium. I'm coming there to win and bring the title back home.","I need that fear factor in training; otherwise, I might get beat by someone I should never lose against, all because I couldn't get up in the morning.","I'm one win away from being a superstar.","I wanted to fight guys like Shane Moseley, Miguel Cotto, and Alvarez.","I will look for the knockout because that's the way I fight.","I'm so proud, and it feels brilliant to be a world champion.","Alvarez is the biggest name in boxing. I'm looking forward to pitting my wits against one of the best in the sport.","I've been wanting to spar Miguel Cotto over in L.A., and that will be priceless, going over there, getting some rounds with such a world class fighter.","The ones doing that, counting me out, are going to look silly.","If you put a camera on the wall, you would laugh at some of the fights me and my brothers had.","I can be the best light-middleweight in the world.","I don't want to emulate anyone.","I've been in the States and fought before. When I'm in that changing room, I'll feel as if I've been in that situation before. Obviously I'm going to have to deal on the biggest stage, and it's the Dallas Cowboys Stadium, but it doesn't faze me.","I'm expecting the best John Thompson. I'd be a fool to expect anything less.","He's fighting for the world title, so we're prepared for the best John Thompson.","People said I didn't deserve to be World Champion, but I think I've proved it.","Without being disrespectful to Jimmy Kelly, I'd rather fight Shane Mosley than Jimmy Kelly.","I didn't become world champion to fight Jimmy Kelly.","I'm getting criticism on social media, saying, 'Ah, you ducked Shane Mosley.' I've never ducked anyone in my life. They need to look into it a bit more.","If you ask my promoters and managers, they will say I've never knocked back an opponent in my life."],"Liana Liberato":["Surround yourself with good people who encourage and love you. There are always ups and downs, no matter how successful you are.","I love 'The Walking Dead,' 'Shameless,' and - this is going to sound really dorky - I'm obsessed with 'Dance Moms.' I love Abby Lee Miller. Honestly, if there's such a thing as past lives, I was definitely a dancer. Maybe if I ever get a big enough name, I can call Abby Lee Miller myself and ask her to be my private coach.","Some people say that they read the first 20 pages, and then decide if they want to do the film or not. But, I have to read the entire thing 'cause anything can change in a script.","I think it would be great to play a superhero. That will be one of my goals.","I tried softball and soccer. I just didn't take as much of a liking to it as I did sitting in a movie theater and watching people recreate a story, and doing it myself, as well.","Any actor has their moments of being stressed, but the great part about this job is that it's so unpredictable, and that's what I like. I love spontaneity. I don't ever want to be bored, doing the same thing from 9 to 5.","When I was 9, I asked my mom if I could be on TV. She was like, 'Well, okay. You can try.'","I would leave school and go to my theater class, and that's when I'd actually sit down and listen. I wouldn't pay attention in school, or I'd sing in class and get in trouble - I'd always get in trouble. Theater is the only thing I always came back to.","The first person I ever really got starstruck over was Nicole Kidman, because I looked up to her. When I was younger, I wouldn't get parts because of how tall I was. I had the body of a 15-year-old but the face of a 12-year-old. I always looked at Nicole Kidman and thought, 'Oh well, she works.'","I always want the audience to identify with my character in some way. I mean, sometimes you'll get characters that aren't very identifiable. Sometimes you can't relate to your character at all. I think it's important to keep the audience interested. But the best advice that I've gotten is to live in the moment.","I started theater when I was three, and I started doing professional acting when I was nine.","I love all kinds of movies. I love a really good comedy and not the cheesy ones. My parents hate this, but I love horror films. Those are my favorite, and of course, dramatic roles. I'm really drawn to those as well. All different genres.","I was involved with MySpace and Facebook and everything at a very young age because it's so casual now, and I'm into texting, obviously. But I've never been involved in any type of chat room. My parents are pretty cautious about it and know all my passwords and know who my friends are and who I'm talking to.","Because I was crazy and because my parents wanted me out of their hair, they put me in an all-day acting class... so they wouldn't have to deal with me, probably. And it just so happened there agents auditing the class, and I ended up getting signed.","Television is a lot more fast-paced, where with films, you really have the ability to get to know your characters. When I was doing guest star roles, I was only one, like, one episode of a thirty minute to an hour show, so you don't really have time to get to know my characters.","I love the 'Walking Dead,' but I don't wanna be an actual prominent character on the show. I just wanna be a zombie.","Every role that I have taken on has demanded some kind of emotional range. I really, really would love to do a comedy, but that opportunity really hasn't opened up.","Don't try to get involved with people on the Internet because it can be very dangerous. The whole point of 'Trust' is to inform people about this issue."],"Liane Balaban":["I've signed autographs as Natalie Portman. I was at a Film Festival party where someone asked if I was her, and I didn't want to embarrass them, so I signed the autograph as her. I hope she doesn't mind.","I've learned over the years that the best way to develop as an artist is to make things. So I tell young artists it's not enough to be an actor anymore, you have to be a filmmaker/writer/director. There's no excuse for waiting around for a job. You have to be active and make things.","I want to be an actor, and I am being an actor. I'm not ready to run off on a road trip. Yet.","I thought I'd be a journalist, and only pursued acting intermittently while studying. My very first interview as a journalist was with David Usher of Moist, and he called the magazine the next day to say it was the best interview he'd done for his solo album. I felt like a million euros.","Young actors often ask me how do you get an agent, how do you get started, how do you get to audition, and I don't know what to tell them because my story is so fluky.","Anything we can do to encourage our young people to celebrate the arts and believe in a career in the arts is wonderful for Canada and for Canadian youth.","I've still got lots of writing in me. I have not left journalism, but I put it on hold to focus on acting. I love actors. I think it's a crazy thing to do with your life, and I have a tremendous amount of respect for them.","I think one of the greatest skills a person can have is to complete a task they start. To take something from beginning, to middle, to end. In life, if you have that skill, I think you can go very far."],"Liane Moriarty":["Google is my best friend and my worst enemy. It's fabulous for research, but then it becomes addictive. I'll have a character eating an orange, and next thing I'm Googling types of oranges, I'm visiting chat rooms about oranges, I'm learning the history of the orange.","Lots of hurtful secrets are better off kept. The problem is that people find it so hard to keep them.","Copywriting probably did make me a commercial writer. Nobody wants to read advertising copy, so you have to keep it punchy; you almost have trick them into reading it. You have to make every sentence work.","I love hearing other people's stories, and I freely admit I'm scavenging for material through their conversations, but really, at the same time, I'm living an ordinary life.","Sometimes when I'm stuck, I really do need that cup of tea, or that chocolate, or a break, or a walk, but in most cases what I actually need to do is make myself keep writing until it flows again.","I'm thinking my next book should be set on a tropical island, which will obviously require days, even weeks of meticulous research, but I'm prepared to make that sacrifice. That's just the sort of dedicated writer I am.","Often, I think bullying - especially in its adult, verbal forms - is the sort of thing you don't realize till the end of the day, and it's a horrible feeling to realize something wasn't just a bland statement but was actually cruel. But then, we're all capable of things that are breathtakingly cruel.","Friends and family do not believe you write fiction. They truly believe that every word you write is either autobiographical or based on them. I once had a character say that she never wanted to be invited to another children's birthday party, and I never received another children's birthday party invitation ever again.","Every time I sit down to write, I need to commit to a word count goal, otherwise I waste too much time editing and re-editing my previous work, staring dreamily off into space, pretending that I'm thinking profound, poetic thoughts when really I'm just thinking, 'Look at me being a writer! I'm so happy I'm a writer!'","I have a six-year-old son and a four-year-old daughter, so I write when they are at school and pre-school, or when I have a babysitter.","Often I think bullying - especially in its adult, verbal forms - is the sort of thing you don't realize till the end of the day, and it's a horrible feeling to realize something wasn't just a bland statement, but was actually cruel. But then we're all capable of - of things that are breathtakingly cruel.","The good thing about writing a novel is that you're creating an imaginary world and can take a break when you need to.","I see lots of differences between Australians and Americans - but as mothers, I think we're pretty much alike!","My real thinking and planning gets done when I'm doing something else like driving or walking or taking the shower.","It's always the paragraphs I loved most, the ones I tenderly polished and re-read with pride, that my editor will suggest cutting.","'Big Little Lies' is the story of a school trivia night that goes horrifically wrong, when one parent ends up dead, possibly murdered. I have never attended a school trivia night where a parent ended up dead. In fact, I've never been to a school trivia night at all.","I'm not an outliner. I come up with a premise and then take it from there.","So many people have said to me that when you become a school parent, it is like going back to school yourself. Some of those insecurities come out and are projected through your child.","We all, as parents, are laughing at ourselves and helicopter parenting and saying, 'This isn't the way we were parented; we were allowed to run free.' When I talk to my friends, we are all fascinated by what we are doing, but we can't seem to stop ourselves.","Now you can get on Facebook and read an article, '10 Ways You Are Ruining Your Child Forever.' I'm sure it's making us better parents in some ways, but in other ways, it is sending us all a little crazy.","American readers are so polite; their reactions make it seem like I've received thousands of thank-you notes. It's just lovely, and amazing the things people tell you that have touched them and related to their own lives.","I did some research into domestic violence, and there were some stories that will stay me with forever.","I remember the absolute joy I used to get out of writing. The purity of imagining something and then putting it down on paper - it was such a pleasure. I read whatever I could get my hands on, from 'Great Expectations' to 'The Thorn Birds.'","I married my first boyfriend. We just married too young. No children. So that broke up. There were a few relationships in between, and then I met my husband Adam when I was 37.","I am very efficient.","Asking myself, 'Is this any good?' is pointless. It just slows down my writing, and I can't tell anyway. It's always the paragraphs I loved most, the ones I tenderly polished and re-read with pride, that my editor will suggest cutting.","My husband does say it is Australia's job and my family's job to keep me grounded. They do a very good job!"],"Liang Chow":["If you have the talent and if you have the ability, and you work for it, you can achieve your goals.","On the balance beam, sometimes it's really hard to stay on if you're having some rough times.","In China, I lived in a dormitory, and the government paid for everything - food, buses. In Iowa, I had to run after the bus, and cook for myself. The first weeks in the U.S., I was asking, 'Where is my food?'","Without the lessons I learned in gymnastics, I would be crushed.","I started with California, and I did not like it. I flew over to Seattle, and I did not like it much. I felt like Iowa is the place - I like the people and the environment.","I think gymnastics trained me as a person, too. Without the lessons I learned in gymnastics, I would be crushed.","I've been coaching the sport for a number of years. And I went through many athletes. Some athletes stay with your program for a long, long period of time. Some athletes, they have a different approach as far as coaching style or your philosophies. I totally respect their own opinions - they have the right to choose their own coach.","I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would have my very own school - no way. And I had no idea I'd be coaching girls. It's wild.","There's a lot of pressure, and it's a long battle, to coach at the elite level. My wife and I didn't take a vacation for 10 years.","God had a plan for everything. I never knew I'd come to Iowa, but now I love Iowa. Everything is so great about it - the people, the environment, education. I'm so proud to say I'm an Iowan. I'm living the dream."],"Liang Wengen":["Our development strategy is based on a deep understanding of our customers. They want high-quality products and good service.","I like to have a sense of accomplishment through work. I'm busy golfing and attending activities, but I think of holding a meeting as playing golf. I think my approach is very good. I don't feel I lose a lot of fun things in life even though I am busy all day.","As for opportunities, there is room for improved product quality and better service and raising our technology standard. In addition, we should have a certain share of the global market. However, we should consider new industries, such as resource development.","Value is created for the customer, and that allows our suppliers, agents and staff that work with Sany to obtain success."],"Lianne La Havas":["I maintain that I never expect anything, therefore I'm always pleasantly surprised.","I've always had this identity thing. When I was little, I was always changing my handwriting because I couldn't decide which one I liked best.","I like to dress for my shape - I think it's important for women to do that generally - it makes me feel good.","I love Diane Keaton's style in 'Annie Hall,' but I like to think my own style is like a cross between 'Annie Hall' and Prince.","I love vintage and I shop vintage a lot because it's just such great value for money.","I love the music of Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu and more recently the music of Laura Marling. All these women share a strength and a wisdom in their voices and music that really makes me want to make music and sing.","I suppose I see myself as a modern soul artist.","When I write I find a quiet place.","Women who have strong identities, who know themselves, really inspire me.","My dad is Greek and my mum Jamaican. My grandparents brought me up for most of my childhood, but I saw my mum and dad all the time.","Well, I like shopping.","I quite like ABBA.","It's really important that my lyrics are truthful.","Sometimes on stage I prefer to feel more glamorous, so I'll go all out when it's a stage outfit like sparkly, colorful, and have a certain shape. If someone is watching it from far away they can maybe remember the shape or the color.","I highly recommend time to yourself.","It's the love you have for yourself that's most important.","I kind of always wanted my own music to just sound like, like me, I suppose, like if I was music it would be the music I make, I think.","Normally I begin writing a song with just with aim to express something, and sometimes I don't know what I want to express until a sentence comes to my head that will sum up everything about how I'm feeling at the time.","I think I'm sort of blind to genre. As long as it has a sort of honesty about it, which I think you'll hear in whatever music you respond to, then I think it doesn't need to be called anything particularly."],"Libba Bray":["Sitting in my favorite coffeehouse with a new notebook and a hot cup of java is my idea of Heaven.","I'm a techno moron. I need help just to plug in my video camera.","I got married in Florence, Italy. My husband and I were in love but totally broke, so we eloped and got married in Italy, where he was going on a business trip. We had to pull a guy off the street to be our witness. It was incredibly romantic. Florence is still one of my favorite cities in the world.","So much of the literature we had to read for high school English class was filled with victimized, tragic, symbolic women who spurred the plot forward with their inevitable shunning/death/shunning-followed-by-pregnancy-followed-by-death timelines.","Any book that can help you survive the slings and arrows of adolescence is a book to love for life; 'The Catcher in the Rye' did just that, and I still do love it.","We're still expected to color within the lines of accepted femininity, and women who step out of those lines are usually attacked, whether verbally or physically.","It's so daunting to walk into a classroom or a school auditorium. It's like the world's weirdest blind date. I know all the students are thinking, 'Who is this tool standing up in front of us?'","When you live in Brooklyn, if you throw a rock, you'll hit a writer - Jonathan Safran Foer, Jonathan Lethem, Paul Auster.","I'm one of those people who has to write. If I don't write, I feel itchy and depressed and cranky. So everybody's glad when I write and stop complaining already.","My dad was a Presbyterian minister. Yes, I am one of those dreaded P.K.s - Preacher's Kids. Be afraid.","I'm related to Davy Crockett on my mom's side. Honest.","I grew up doing theatre and spent a long time as a playwright. I still think very visually when I write.","Naming my favorite books feels like naming a favorite child - impossible.","I love to be scared. Not, 'Hey, I think I smell smoke...' scared, but creepy, paranoid, what's-that-out-there-in-the-dark, ghost story scared. It's no surprise that I was the girl who got invited to the slumber parties because I could be counted on to tell a tale to scare the bejesus out of you.","'Pastoralia' by George Saunders. Possibly my favorite book. It's one of the weirdest books I've ever read. If Monty Python and Thomas Pynchon had a love child, and it was raised by Frank Zappa on a weird commune, that would be this book.","'The Catcher in the Rye.' When I was a teenager, that was my book; yes, somebody gets it, somebody gets adolescence.","You know that moment in 'The Matrix' when Neo takes the red pill and is plunged into the real world? That's what it felt like when I first read 'Watchmen' - like someone was taking a can opener to my head to make room for Moore's audacious brilliance.","I was a big reader as a kid, but it was 'Charlotte's Web' that showed me you could feel as if you were actually living inside a book.","My joke is that my father was a minister and my mother was an English teacher, so I'm trained to see the world in terms of symbols, which is hard when you just want to make toast.","We're comfortable with women in certain roles but not comfortable with women expressing anger or fully accepting their power. The most daring question a woman can ask is, 'What do I want?'"],"Libby Houston":["When your dreams tire, they go underground and out of kindness that's where they stay.","The base emotions Plato banned have left a radio-active and not radiant land."],"Libby Trickett":["I can't believe it. I'm speechless. It is amazing to see where I've come from the last two years.","I'm so over the moon that I have the opportunity to represent my country at a third Olympic Games.","It is completely surreal because two years ago I wasn't swimming, I was 10 kilos heavier and was on a completely different path in my life, I was still living in Sydney, I'm just so happy now.","It's the best fifth place I've ever had.","I could see myself still swimming because I'm really enjoying the sport. But at the same time I have this biological clock that is ticking.","I really would like to start a family as well. Whether I can balance the two or have to decide one or the other way, I'm not sure what will happen.","I'm a different athlete, I'm a different person.","I've probably given myself enough time to prepare for this meet and we're all different athletes so I can't take their results as what's going to be inevitable for me.","I feel good. I'm up there. I got third in the 100 'fly, I've qualified in the top eight already for the 100 freestyle.","I'm pretty confident.","It's so rewarding the journey that I've been on.","The fact that I am as lean as I was in 2008, I'm stronger than I was in 2008 I think I have the potential to be as fast as I was.","That's pretty rewarding in itself coming from where I started. Obviously the next goal for me is to make the Olympic team.","I went through so many things personally, emotionally and mentally during that time off that I know that I'm better for it now and I think I'm a better athlete because of that."],"Liberace":["When the reviews are bad I tell my staff that they can join me as I cry all the way to the bank.","You can have either the Resurrection or you can have Liberace. But you can't have both.","You know that bank I used to cry all the way to? I bought it.","I cried all the way to the bank."],"Liberty Hyde Bailey":["A garden requires patient labor and attention. Plants do not grow merely to satisfy ambitions or to fulfill good intentions. They thrive because someone expended effort on them.","When the traveler goes alone he gets acquainted with himself.","The true purpose of education is to teach a man to carry himself triumphant to the sunset.","A person cannot love a plant after he has pruned it, then he has either done a poor job or is devoid of emotion.","Science may eventually explain the world of How. The ultimate world of Why may remain for contemplation, philosophy, religion.","There is no excellence without labor. One cannot dream oneself into either usefulness or happiness.","We accept it because we have seen the vision. We know that we cannot reap the harvest, but we hope that we may so well prepare the land and so diligently sow the seed that our successors may gather the ripened grain.","Every decade needs its own manual of handicraft.","Give the children an opportunity to make garden. Let them grow what they will. It matters less that they grow good plants than that they try for themselves.","I do not yet know why plants come out of the land or float in streams, or creep on rocks or roll from the sea. I am entranced by the mystery of them, and absorbed by their variety and kinds. Everywhere they are visible yet everywhere occult.","No beast has ever conquered the earth; and the natural world has never been conquered by muscular force.","One's happiness depends less on what he knows than on what he feels.","There are two essential epochs in any enterprise - to begin, and to get done.","Extension work is not exhortation. Nor is it exploitation of the people, or advertising of an institution, or publicity work for securing students. It is a plain, earnest, and continuous effort to meet the needs of the people on their own farms and in the localities.","Anyone who acquires more than the usual amount of knowledge concerning a subject is bound to leave it as his contribution to the knowledge of the world.","My life has been a continuous fulfillment of dreams. It appears that everything I saw and did has a new, and perhaps, more significant meaning, every time I see it. The earth is good. It is a privilege to live thereon."],"Liberty Ross":["My favourite designers always create a strong silhouette, like McQueen and Tom Ford and Alaia. I like structured things that you can throw on, and it's almost like armour, and you're, like, ready for the day.","My eldest brother Atticus just won an Oscar some years ago, as he wrote the music for 'The Social Network.'","I romanticized domesticity for a while, and loved having a shopping list of groceries stuck to the fridge for the first time.","I went from the glamour of working with Karl Lagerfeld and John Galliano to living on an isolated hilltop, with my husband gone most of the time.","Whatever I wear has to be comfortable.","The most valuable thing I can share is the importance of living in truth. Sometimes, facing those truths can actually be your worst fear.","Trusting your gut is always the best thing - no matter what people around you insist you should be doing or saying or thinking. Only you know and once you live in truth,your heart is completely free.","No life is perfect; we all have our problems and issues, and I believe that it's good to be true to who you are.","I'm terrible at sticking to any sort of diet. The more I think I can't eat something, the more I want to eat it. And I know this is the most annoying thing for a girl to say, but I'm just really lucky; I can eat pretty much what I want.","I would never say out loud that I am raising my children alone, but a lot of the time it has felt like that.","What I have always loved about modelling is the chance to play a part. I am quite shy naturally, but I like getting into somebody else's head space, understanding how people work and the psychology behind their actions.","I love when girls wear print-on-print. It looks so cool.","I love heels, and as a size 36, I've accumulated a wall of amazing high heels from catwalk shows over the years where designers had to make especially small shoes. Tom Ford's golden versions are my favourite. I do, however, also live in my flat Saint Laurent Chelsea boots or Givenchy sneakers.","I have created a capsule collection for Genetic inspired by memories of growing up in LA. Denim has always been my go-to, especially during my modelling days. I discovered Genetic Denim about five years ago - they are so comfy, you could almost be wearing your pyjamas.","I love going out dancing. There is nothing better than letting your hair down and staying up far too late, is there?","My father ran a famous L.A. nightclub complete with roller-rink - Flippers - in the early Eighties which was the West Coast's answer to Studio 54.","I believe in love, and I have no trouble with commitment or loyalty; that's never been a problem for me.","Everyone lives under their rocks in L.A., so it takes a long time to find your lane.","Acting has always been something I've wanted to get into. I think the best models are actors; you're taking on a character. In that sense, I have been acting for a long time. It didn't seem like a crazy transition.","Acting is a bigger step into modelling in a way. Modelling is easier when you don't look like yourself. When you look like a different person, you feel different. Acting goes deeper into that; you have to move and talk like that character. I love it.","I have four older siblings and one younger, and all three of my brothers are in the music industry. My dad was really involved in music, too, with the disco, and he also started Radio Caroline and was the one who invented pirate radio, if you like, off on a coast in England on a boat.","My mum had this idea I was going to be this long-haired hippie playing guitar and bought me one when I was 13, but my little brother picked it up instead and was such a natural, he kept it! Io Echo is a band my brother now plays in; they're really good.","I worked a lot with Nick Knight and John Galliano when John was at Dior. He also made my wedding dress. He'll always hold a special place; I have most of my memorable, iconic moments in fashion with him.","The first years of my life were spent in a roller disco in the early '80s called Flipper's. It was a real riotous, incredible time. I am slightly obsessed with the place.","I honestly don't think about myself; it's more about my kids. They were both born in L.A., and they're like little beams of sun, little tornadoes, and they can't be in a confined space. And one of the things I love most about L.A. is the freedom there.","There's a jean for everyone. And I'm a fan of that. I love a jean, and I love all these spins on them. I love a printed Balmain jean, or a Givenchy, and I love the prints, I love that you can have so much fun with it all, you know, dressing up.","I still have my Levi's jacket that I bought on the Portobello Road when I was 14, and it's like part of me, you know, it's got oils in it, and it's my comfort, security blanket or something.","I have five siblings, so my mom was always pregnant, and she would wear these dungarees that looked so cool.","I love the fabric of Genetic jeans. There's a softness. I always travel in them. It feels like you're in like your most comfortable pajamas."],"Lidia Bastianich":["Eating well, being around the table with the family or friends or relatives - it doesn't get any better.","By cooking with your kids, you can help them understand that food is a powerful tool in connecting human beings.","Make gifts meaningful by putting the time in creating them, whether baking and cooking, or in making arts and craft. It will all have more meaning for the giver and receiver.","I love cooking vegan. Anybody can come in any time to any of our restaurants and get a vegan meal or a gluten-free meal as well.","Cooking for somebody is very personal.","What I continuously remember is when I was a child in the courtyard with my grandmother and we milked the goat and we made the ricotta. The still-warm ricotta from our goat, on top of a piece of bread, and we used to sprinkle just a little bit of honey or sugar on it. That flavor, that stays in my memory.","I think Chicago's a great city. Like New York, it's full of energy.","What I do is my life, but it's not like I spend 18 hours a day, seven days a week in the restaurants.","I'll get home from work on Friday night and take out some beans and soak them. The next morning, I'll put them in a pot for soup, then just keep chopping, chopping, chopping - carrots and celery and cabbage - and in two or three hours, you have this wonderful, mellow soup that fills up the whole house with its aroma.","I just love engaging a live audience - I love that.","Kids today are really so alienated from the source of food. If they are going to nourish themselves properly, if they are going to safeguard this environment we have and the economy that goes with it and world hunger that goes with it, they need to know about food.","I am a transporter of the Italian culture - culinary culture, family culture - because I love it, I thrive in it, and I think it's the right way.","Whether you talk about the olive oil, whether you talk about Aceto Balsamico, whether you talk about Grana Padano, whether you talk about Mozzarella di Bufala. These are all traditional Italian products that are hard to beat, and they're easy to transport and buy. You don't have to do much around it. Just eat them.","Make your refrigerator or freezer like a treasure chest.","I think people make it too systematic in a way, like it's a chemistry formula. Food is not like that; food is very forgiving. Connecting and making do with a lot of the food elements can be fun and exciting.","Choose recipes like a base recipe; make a big pot of soup and freeze it. From then on, you can take it in any direction. Another day put rice in it, or then put corn or sausages. From there, it's endless.","Food is culture. Food is an identity, a footprint of who you are.","I am blessed that the food business is good for me. Good to me.","I see how people connect with me on different level through my show, how they want to transport what I cook into their home kitchens for their own families. It's my responsibility to always make sure that is quality.","Don't accept what a grocery store has for you. Tell the store to get you want you want. If you want honey from a local farmer, organic honey, you tell them. We are in control. It's up to us as the consumer to get what we want.","Younger generations, they ask more questions, like on a recipe. But they ask them online. If my staff doesn't know how to answer it, I will answer.","The Caprese salad perfectly represents the colors of the Italian flag. While I am not so sure that the colors of the flag stem from the cuisine, there is no denying that those colors do evoke a typical Italian plate.","If I'm not tasting wine and food... I'm thinking about wine and food. If I'm not thinking about wine and food... I'm writing about wine and food.","Food feeds our souls. It is the single great unifier across all cultures. The table offers a sanctuary and a place to come together for unity and understanding.","All of my books have been about authentic Italian food in Italy and bringing that message about simple and authentic food.","I think a ricotta cheesecake is very easy to make.","Holidays - any holiday - are such a great opportunity to focus on bringing the family together.","Vin brule is a version of mulled wine enjoyed in Piemonte, in northwestern Italy. It's a perfect choice for holiday entertaining because you can double or even triple the recipe and leave it over very low heat, ladling it out as your guests come in from the cold.","Food is kind of my entry card into everything. Food kind of opens the doors... because food is peace. It's good; it's positive.","I was an immigrant. I came here at 12. We were caught behind the Iron Curtain until I was 10.","When I first came here, Italian food wasn't anything I recognized. I didn't know what Italian American food was; we never ate it at home. It was the food of immigrants who came here and made use of the ingredients they had.","When we're filming, I sometimes look into the camera and wonder who's out there, who will be watching.","If you're like me, food is a medium for communication. It's an expression of love and affection.","I love that I've become a mentor, almost like a mother, to all the people out there that love Italian, that love cooking. I seem to make them comfortable.","When you invite friends over, especially for food, with the food you want to send out a message of affection, of appreciation, of celebration. But also of culture - who your family is.","I attended classes and taught classes, in Food Anthropology at Pace University, with an anthropology professor. You can trace history by the architecture and food of a place. Food is one of those things that transcends and stays in the culture.","With the Industrial Revolution, the production of food was delegated to big companies in order for women and men to be in the labour force, to come home, stick something in the oven, and eat. It became a big industry that does not have a love affair with food nor is really concerned about nurturing you or giving you the right nutrition.","I was born in Allied-controlled Pola. At the end of World War II, the victorious wartime Allied powers negotiated the details of peace treaties and borders with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. The Paris Treaty was signed on February 10, 1947. I was born a few days later.","Everybody can cook. You don't have to do anything fancy. You can do a nice antipasto spread with sardines, anchovies, some meats, marinated vegetables, fruits, cheese, nuts, and crackers.","For me, it's the ultimate to be able to nurture and nourish someone. They trust you. It's a basic form of intimacy in a community.","Why do you think millennials are so into food? It's the way they relate to each other.","When you sit down to eat at a table, you are ready to take in nourishment - we all need to eat to live. Even in primal tribes, people ate together. It's the opening for friendship.","Chemistry was my college interest. Cooking is about chemistry.","What I learned being a young child was respect for food. Don't throw anything away.","What really makes your business is your workers - their commitment, their knowledge, how you train them, how you treat them. They have to make the entity a winning entity.","When I say, 'Everybody to the table and eat,' I mean it. That is the glue, the center that holds the family, that gives security. Good food brings everybody to the table.","When I started as a young chef, I was Italian, and I was a woman, and everyone else in New York was French and a man.","Julia Child came to my house and wanted a lesson in making risotto.","You should just feel comfortable with food and your own culinary culture, whatever your mother and grandmother know.","As a chef, I feel that it is my duty to make the most of what the earth gives us.","I love teaching.","It's in the nature of Italians to live life with a positive tone and to celebrate the invitations that come along in life. Italian food is so conducive to all of that.","Match the right food to the right occasion. Think about what you are celebrating. If you are honoring people, what are their favorite foods? If it is a holiday, what is the food for it? When you give an identity to the party, people appreciate that.","Simplicity in preparation is the Italian way. Make easy dishes, and then you can elaborate the final preparation by decorating with vegetables or herbs or adding a dash of olive oil.","It's important to let children fly on their own. I understood that they needed to create their own life and not be my shadow. Let them make their own decisions, and support them along the way.","The service of food is to nurture, to please, to nourish.","I started in the restaurant industry when I was 22, so I've had quite a long tenure, if you will.","Telling my grandchildren stories of my growing up is some of our favorite times spent together. They want to know what it was like and what I did as a child. They seem to be especially interested in the organic and simplistic setting I grew up in.","Traditions are our roots and a profile of who we are as individuals and who we are as a family. They are our roots, which give us stability and a sense of belonging - they ground us.","I think traditions change and modify with each generation. With new members joining the family, their customs and traditions have to be respected and combined with the exiting traditions. And the children that follow are part of that new evolving tradition and, as they grow, will have input that will, in turn, continue to evolve that tradition.","Italian food really reflects the people. It reflects like a prism that fragments into regions.","America has many cultures which makes it great, but it's difficult to create one strong identity.","My grandmother had a courtyard of animals, like goats and chickens. She made ricotta cheese, cooked with potatoes warm from the garden, grew everything from beans to wheat. It was simple, seasonal food, and we all ate what was produced 10 miles from where we lived. It was that way for centuries.","There is a history to Italian food that goes back thousands of years, and there's a basic value of respecting food. America is young and doesn't have that.","When you are the host, you have to take the party into your hands like a conductor.","You can freeze a nice sponge cake and then have a strawberry shortcake any time.","Eating is something we all have to do. When we sit down at the table, we nurture ourselves, and hence, all our resistance goes away. We are open to receiving good and taking it in with gusto and pleasure.","In 1981, we opened Felidia, and the newspapers, the city papers, the big timers came, and I got invited on the 'Today Show' and so on. A lot of food luminaries would come to Felidia - Julia Child, James Beard, they all came.","The best things - when I really feel that I'm communicating, and when I really feel that people are getting it - are simple, straightforward recipes. I think simple is the hardest to achieve because you don't have all those elements to hide behind.","The filming happens in my home, and I cook like I do at home, on my home stove with my house pots and so on. That's who I am. I am very true to my real profile.","Food is all about the story of a people through the ages.","Physically, women have some challenges in the kitchen, like lifting heavy pots on and off the stove. You learn to adapt; you learn to find a way. But the biggest challenge for women in this industry is how to balance a family with such a demanding career.","I love telling stories. You know why I love it? Because people love listening.","I cherish my beautiful Italian heritage.","Food is the common language for all of us.","My success is that I have these two great cultures behind me. One is Italian. I've continued to nurture that. But I also feel very American.","My evolution came not as a plan but as opportunities came. People offer them when they see you're doing something well. It's up to you to recognize them, take them, and then dedicate yourself to them.","There's a great need to convene at the table with family and friends. People are feeling it and wanting it. For me to be a minor player in helping with that, it makes me so happy.","I develop trust, and I think it's the most important to my growth. If my restaurants are always full and my books sell, it's this trust.","I'm not an entertainer - that's not what I do. I want to teach viewers; I want to show them. I want to share my culture.","I cooked for the two Popes that were here. Pope Francis I cooked for and Pope Benedict before him. Pope Benedict is German. And I did a little research - his mother was a chef.","I'm simple in my approach and straightforward. I connect with the average person that is interested in food.","Italians are very conscious of what they eat, how they eat, and its digestion.","Italy is so influenced by others: couscous in the south, cinnamon in the north because of the Venetian spice trade - I just want to divulge as much information as I can.","Cooking is about the ingredients and responding, but risotto, specifically, is about the technique.","That's the beauty of risotto. You can make it any flavor you want. It's a great carrier.","Cooking is good therapy for me.","Nature recharges me.","I had my first child at 21, my first restaurant at 24.","The food of a country is my story. It is a small story, but people relate so much to it. I want to share that, but also the idea of bringing people and family together.","I love making apple strudel.","I am the perfect example that if you give somebody a chance, especially here in the United States, one can find the way.","We had our wheat. We made our own olive oil. We made our wine. We had chickens, ducks; we had sheep, cows, milk. So I was raised in a very simple situation but understanding really food from the ground... the essence of food and the flavors. And those memories I took with me, and I think that they lingered on.","I found great rewards in cooking a dish and feeding it to someone. It was a means of communicating. I was giving part of my talent or my gift and sharing it with somebody, making somebody happy. And it gave a lot back to me, and I wanted to do more and more.","I think that lunch is one of the most enjoyable and important things in the day. But you need to create the space and the time to do just that. And in Italy, we do that.","If we don't focus on when we eat - like, let's say we watch television or something - you eat much more. If you focus on the food - you smell it, you cook it - you're enjoying it already.","My grandmother was the genesis of my connection and passion to food.","My grandmother taught me the seasonality of food. She lived with the rhythms of nature. That's the way we should live. Why do we need raspberries in January flown from Chile?","A box of spaghetti can take seven minutes to cook, and you can make a sauce at that time with perhaps garlic, olive oil, and zucchini. Then you've got yourself a complete meal. The whole thing shouldn't take more than half an hour.","Italian food is seasonal. It is simple. It is nutritionally sound. It is flavorful. It is colorful. It's all the things that make for a good eating experience, and it's good for you."],"Liev Schreiber":["Style, no matter how outrageous it is, is still an expression of someone's personality. And my personality is somewhere stuck in the classics.","You watch a hockey game, and the hand-eye coordination and the speed is really miraculous; how those guys track the puck alone, just following it with their eyes.","Entitlement is lethal.","I love my mother and father. The older I get, the more I value everything that they gave me.","You'd think true masculinity was just calm and collected happiness. So alpha male that it needs not or worries not. But typically masculine characters are always fighting, and most violence comes from some agitated level of fear and anxiety.","I get very nervous around famous people and I get nervous around beautiful women.","No offense to the Canadians, but I believe location is like a character, and authenticity really matters. When you're in a place like New York or D.C., you just can't beat it, and it's so hard to recreate because they are both such distinctive places. I think it's pretty easy these days to tell films that are shot in Toronto.","My mother didn't let me see color films. I saw a lot of black-and-white films. The first time I saw Basil Rathbone, I was completely taken. To me, that was the epitome of great acting, was Basil Rathbone - not only in Sherlock Holmes, but the Sheriff of Nottingham, and all the terrible characters he had to play alongside Errol Flynn.","I've got nothing against L.A. I think it is a really beautiful place. To be able to surf and get out in the Pacific Ocean every once in a while. The hiking, all of that is amazing. I love it there.","I grew up in the Lower East Side of New York.","As soon as you know what you're doing, you're doing it wrong.","My publicist told me not to talk about politics but, yes, I think we have a president who stole the election.","You should never ask actors about politics.","I'm misrepresented as a scary person. I'm not. It's all about my size and my eyebrows.","You know, I have a deep, deep affinity for Dr. Seuss.","As soon as you know what you're doing, you're doing it wrong. That's what I find with acting. As soon as it becomes padded, it becomes pat.","I get panic attacks in big crowds.","I did some research into what was going on in terms of the sexual revolution that was happening in the '60s in the gay community and particularly in the drag world. Before the '60s, guys doing drag would dress like their mothers or iconic Hollywood actresses.","It's finding time for each other. That's the trick to any relationship, you know. Finding time to really be present for each other.","I am very good with dialects, but the two that I can't do for some reason are the South African and Australian.","I manage to hide in my movies.","You can think about your career or you can think about your job. I like to think about my job.","There's the private persona and the public persona and the two shall never meet.","Hamlet is a remarkably easy role. Physically it's hard because it tends to be about three hours long and you're talking the whole time. But it's a simple role and it adapts itself very well, because the thing about Hamlet is, we all are Hamlet.","If I'm doing my job as an actor, the audience knows everything I know about the character.","It's good to overexpose yourself with work. But don't expose yourself too much with the press.","I really don't think there is anybody in the business with better eyes than Elijah Wood.","Some actors need to be rattled and some need to be focused.","I didn't think that a career in theater was very realistic so I thought the only thing I could make money doing and still be somewhat artistic was, god help me, advertising.","If you fall in love with somebody you're working with, fine, but wait till your project is over.","I live with an 18-month-old Jack Russell named Chicken. He moved in about 15 months ago, and it was very hard at first because I work a lot and he doesn't.","I was a writer. I just wasn't a very good one. I was lucky enough to have a playwriting teacher who told me that I'd be a better actor than I would a playwright.","Everyone assumes that novelists are smarter and more interesting. They're generally smarter and more interesting, but they're often very short. So it kind of cancels all the smart and interesting stuff out.","If you are going to remake a film, you may as well remake a classic.","I am so used to being able to express myself from being an actor. So when people don't understand me, I'm just completely lost.","When you're in a place like New York or D.C. you just can't beat it, and it's so hard to recreate because they are both such distinctive places.","A lot of times in Hollywood you're as good as your last job.","I'm not that interested in working with impervious people.","I was always drawn to tough girls. I liked that domineering thing.","Every girl I've gone out with has said something to me first.","I'm drawn to people who share that sense of loss. All actors are trying to repair damaged relationships. I think that might be why I've been drawn to other actors.","I actually loved Winnipeg. Everyone told me I was going to hate it, but it was great.","The funny thing is that I write and I act a lot about being Jewish, but I don't really think about it as a regular person.","I think New York will always be this incredible international crossroads, and I don't think that will ever change.","Actors, you know, they're often awkward people in real life.","And I think for me there's a lot of neurosis involved with where you should be or thinking about where you are all the time instead of being where you are.","That's one of the benefits of working on big budget films. You work with people who have a lot of experience and you get to learn a lot.","Where else do you find great directors? Acting is one of the places.","I'm a typically lazy person. It is sort of characteristic of actors.","Film is such a bizarre vehicle for acting. It's such a bizarre experience. I don't think you ever really get familiar with it. If you do get familiar with it, you're probably not that good anymore.","I'm actually a very bad surfer, which is good because everybody likes a bad surfer. Nobody likes a good surfer.","Don't hit people; don't let it get you too angry; remember that everything you do can and will be used against you. And take a breath and have some perspective.","I think that everything I've ever done at some point is part of someone else's legacy.","Part of what I enjoy about the theatre and acting is that sense of history.","You always have to create the character from the ground up.","Well, I don't think I've ever been a huge target for the press, and I value that to a degree, because there's a certain value for actors staying beneath the radar so they can play characters.","The best gig is the one you've got.","No, I grew up admiring people who played ice hockey.","The skill set for hockey is so specific to skating and if you haven't been skating as a kid it's impossible to play - and I wasn't a skater.","I think it's really, really important to mix it up as an actor, to try to get as much kind of varied experience as you can, not only for your own personal growth as an actor but for the audience to keep them guessing about what you're going to do.","I'm kind of an obsessive-compulsive person, like, neat obsessive.","I love having that creative discussion where, at the end of the day, you both feel better for having done it. Maybe it's a typically Jewish thing, where you sort of go at each other.","I was always curious about motivation and intention, and really, that's a lot of what acting is.","And you know, I hate to admit this, but I don't always think in terms of Shakespeare. When I eat, I do. When I'm at a restaurant, I'll think, 'Hmm, what would Macbeth have ordered?'","I find that the most interestingly written parts happen to be the bad guys.","I really never thought I was that good at film. And honestly still don't. My strength is language. My background is monologues and a certain kind of Brechtian spin on theater.","My grandfather was raising me, and in many respects, I was trying to understand what it meant to be a man. He was my role model.","My style was always intuitive. I never used to believe in working on your body. Anything that smacked of vanity to me was bad for your acting, but I learned that wasn't true.","Everyone says villains are thankless parts, but those are really the best roles.","There's nothing more exciting than that conversation you have with a live audience. It's the best feeling in the world.","You hear different things from different people, and they're all valid: they're all valuable. I think that's what comprises a performance is all those ideas.","During 'Manchurian Candidate' - that role originated with Laurence Harvey, and I studied everything he did. I would never be able to reproduce that performance, but I got a lot of ideas from watching it.","Home is New York.","I went to school in Massachusetts at Hampshire College.","I think conflicted characters are always more interesting.","I'm someone who started in the theater and really couldn't stand repeating the show. My favorite part of acting is the five or six weeks of rehearsal that you get. I like doing previews; I like the opening week because my friends and family come, and then after that, I don't want to do it anymore.","I've never been a heavy practitioner of the method or, at least, with any specific intent; I'm kind of an impulse-based person. Like, I'm sort of waiting for something to happen that I'm not expecting, and I kind of want to jump on that train of emotion, whatever it is, both from myself or from the other actor.","I struggle with the idea of comparing people's work and art. The notion of giving awards or putting a competitive spin on something that is a relative art form is sort of odd to me.","I had great teachers, great ensembles, and great companies to work with who supported my career.","I'm terrible with big parties.","I was always curious about motivation and intention, and really, that's a lot of what acting is. I was a little bit different.","The guy who kind of broke the story in 'Spotlight' was a priest, the guy who had sort of done all the research. One of the things he said when one of the 'Spotlight' reporters asked him how he could still remain a Catholic, he said that, 'My faith is in the eternal, and the church is an organization.'","We have to remember to respect the faith of people and maybe not the organizations or the groups that manifest around it.","The premise for me has always been that it's vulnerable people who do violent things. And the more vulnerable they feel, often, the more violent they are. But I think, you know, that's an idea that comes from history, from classical theater, for me.","That's really how I got started was doing Shakespeare. When I got out of school, I was lucky enough to meet George Wolfe, who ran The Public Theater.","I think, the first time I played Iago at the Public Theater, I realized I had a - much to my chagrin - I realized I had an instinct for these conflicted characters, for these torn characters, for these characters who could be described as evil. I wouldn't describe them that way.","The interesting thing about doing serial television is that the character is growing separate from you, the character and the show are growing, and you get to observe that and participate with it in a way that I think is actually really exciting for an actor.","I remember finding 'Harold and Maude' strangely erotic. I've always had an octogenarian fetish.","I find old women at weddings and funerals attractive; I have this weird mortality thing.","The worst bar fights I ever saw were in London. I saw a guy break a pint glass in another guy's face in a club in the Eighties. It was a gay club, too.","When my grandpa was moved to physical action, you felt utter terror.","I have the kind of face that people want to punch.","I have Slavic fat pads that make me look like a chipmunk and arched predatory eyebrows. With that, you're not going to get funny. That's why I play so many bad guys.","Theater is consistent. You ride your bike to work. You get most of the day off so you can see your kids. My problem is that after three months, I go mad. One of the reasons I never thought I could do a TV show is that I hate doing the same thing over and over again."],"Lil Mama":["Ever since I was a kid, I was always a fan of hip hop. If you get your limelight whether your sixteen or twenty-one or wherever you're at, you get your lime when you get your lime, but if you're a part of hip hop and a child of hip hop, then you will always be a part of hip hop.","Lauryn Hill might have cursed a couple of times in her music, and Missy Elliot definitely just doesn't care. I'm really more inspired by their creativity more so than just the cursing. I'm really impressed by clean music.","I'm a bombshell, so I'm going to do me. If I want to go platinum, I'm going platinum.","I like the OMG Girlz. They're real and they're friends.","I'm born to do music. I'm born to act. I'm born to dance and all of these things, and I will be respected.","TLC has helped me to know that as a musician, I can talk about anything; that there are no barriers, and that you can be yourself. That's what I love about them. Left Eye in particular helped me to stay on top of my A game. She's one of the best female MCs that I've heard.","I didn't know that Left Eye's dad passed away right when she wanted to tell him that she just signed to LaFace Records. After I signed to Jive Records and just before I put out my first album, my mother passed away. It was very odd how much we had in common.","When I was younger, coming up in this industry, I was 17, 18 years old. You couldn't tell me Beyonce wasn't my friend. You couldn't tell me that Janet Jackson wasn't my girl. You couldn't tell me that once I signed to my label that me and J.Lo weren't going to have tea in L.A.","When I was 17 years old, I put out an album while my mother was dying of cancer. That right there alone is a struggle. That's hard. That's tough for anybody.","One of the things that makes me most happy about music is that I can look at a picture and see Da Brat, Missy, Lil Kim, Left Eye, and I know Aaliyah is a singer, but to see them all in one photo together hugging and laughing and really having genuine love for each other... I want to feel that with my hip hop sisters.","In my day, in my era, Ralph McDaniels, just being five and being at his block party, you could just got onstage.","At the end of the day, I'm talented, and there's only one Lil Mama.","My cut is blunt and futuristic, and Nicki Minaj started wearing that bob on her head after she came to my show, so at the end of the day, I know what I do, and I know what I possess, and I know who I am. I'm a trendsetter. The biggest form of flattery is imitation, so I'm flattered.","MC Lyte definitely embraces me. Jada Pinkett Smith embraces me. Those are two people that I can call and get advice. Those are two people that will call me to see what I'm doing."],"Lil Rel Howery":["Let me tell you, there's nothing like pulling up to Fox Studios bumping Jeezy in your Mercedes.","The biggest thing is we need to stop acting like racism don't exist.","That's the biggest thing: be kind and be original.","My respect for TSA agents went up a notch. We look at 'em like, 'You can't bother me, I'm gettin' on my flight. Stop wastin' my time.' They're doing it to protect us. Their job is to do everything they're doing. We sometimes don't respect other people's jobs because we're caught up in our world.","So people thought once Obama got into office that racism was over with. But, what we ended up learning was that it just came more into the light.","You have these kids trying to make these grown up decisions because nobody is talking to them. We're talking at them, but we're not listening to them.","I can't wait for the rest of my career to meet these young writers and filmmakers so that I can produce and push a lot of their stories out there.","I'm not gonna go steal an airport car and go save someone. That's crazy. But I will do almost anything for any of my friends.","There's a difference between delivering real funny and just silly funny.","Everybody makes a decision about where they want their career to go. If I really want something, I put a lot of effort into it. If I don't want something, I won't.","I love acting. I was one of those dudes that was always in the plays in the church and at school.","The honesty of my material and my being vulnerable was from Richard Pryor. He doesn't mind talking about his life, which is why I think he was one of the dopest to ever do it.","Directing is so dope to me, man, 'cause it doesn't necessarily have to be your material. You're making someone else's material come to life. There's something amazing about that.","Not everybody gonna be in front of the camera forever, man. That's impossible. Don't get me wrong, I love doing that. But behind the scenes and the power is what I like. I like being in control. And maybe someday I'd be a showrunner.","I was a huge Wu-Tang fan, along with Crucial Conflict, along with Do or Die along with Mobb Deep.","I'm a hip-hop head, but hip-hop actually introduced me to other genres of music because I started to wonder where a lot of these samples came from. So I fell in love with Bobby Womack or Willie Hutch because I wanted to know where those samples came from.","I know I'm being biased about Chicago, but I think Chicago got the most talented people in the world.","When I started comedy, I was a big Eddie Murphy fan. I thought if you did stand-up, you were supposed to know how to act, write, and host. I thought it was all one thing. That's why it doesn't feel like I'm transitioning to acting: because in my stand-up, I do characters all the time.","Some of the scariest movies I've seen are not considered horror movies, like 'Gone Girl.' That movie scared me. I can't watch it again.","I want to do more films - not just comedies, because I really want to show my range.","I thought I would hate New York, but I love New York. I almost hate to say that being from Chicago.","'No Scrubs' is a mean song for a lot of reasons. If you're 18, 19-year-old guy, or even 17, your friend just got a license. You don't have a real job yet. It's like that song asks you to be an adult way faster than you should.","I'm all for making a woman-empowering song. I get that, and I think that's dope. I've got a daughter, and I think that's amazing. But when you're specifically picking on guys, that's when it's not right. 'No Scrubs' is the meanest, dumbest song ever made because they need to be specific in certain areas.","My friends were the class clowns, but I was the one in class doing Michael Jordan or teachers for no reason. I've always been amazing at impersonating real people, too, rather than celebrities.","Chicago made me. They can treat me however they want to treat me anywhere else in the country. When I go back home, they treat me like I'm a star.","I'm just saying, and I'm going to say it enough times: I want to play Bernie Mac.","I think when we grow up watching TV, the stars seem like stars. You don't know what they went through. You don't know how they got it. It almost seems unattainable. With social media, we are able to show people if you work hard, that you can literally do the same thing.","My kids are really dope. I was just at home in Chicago, and my daughter Brittany was interviewing me. It was like I was on 'Oprah.'","I think Eddie Murphy is the greatest comedian. I do think that Richard Pryor is the Godfather, but Eddie Murphy, in my opinion, has every comedic category in his arsenal. He can roast you. He can freestyle. He can host. He was LeBron James before we even saw LeBron James.","My comedy grows as I grow as a person.","I'm a student of Comedy Central. It launched careers: Wanda Sykes and even Kevin Hart. The first time I was introduced to him, he was on Comedy Central. It puts you on the map... Hollywood knows now.","I used to watch 'Last Comic Standing' with my mom before she passed. So when I got that red envelope, I was extremely emotional.","Not saying that we are realer than most people, but because Chi is so segregated, first of all, we have to be diverse comedians and be able to make a lot of different people laugh. And Chicago comics, we're OK with who we are in our truth. That stems from Bernie Mac and a lot of other greats who came before me.","What has kept me focused were my kids. My biggest focus is just making sure I'm good to my babies."],"Lil Uzi Vert":["I'm just doing me, and to me, that's what got me this far.","If you're you, it doesn't matter if you're the most boring person in the world: someone will like you. You're not trying to be anyone else.","I stopped thinking; I just go out, and everything is in the moment. I just stop thinking and start moving - you just gotta be you.","Don't get me wrong: school is good and all, but school is way too slow for me. Like, super slow. So I didn't want to go. I wanted to learn on my own with real life experiences.","One thing I could tell you is that I'm all over the place.","I like to look cool and dress nice. Lil Uzi is a rock star. Just know that.","I just want to be successful. I'm not going to sit here and be like, 'I want to win a Grammy' or whatever; if that comes, that's awesome. But I just want to be successful and provide for my whole family and get my family out the hood.","One thing rap and rock have in common, a lot of it is focused on negativity. I like dark stuff.","There are always people who are into the old way of doing things. I don't think it's a bad thing necessarily, but things change - nothing stays the same. If you can stay true to yourself, you're always going to be legendary.","'Vert' is, like, straight to the top, like a vertical leap.","I don't know who I can compare my style to because I listen to everybody from old to new. If I hear stuff that I like, I'll definitely gravitate to it and spin it in my own way. I'm a mixture of a lot of people, honestly, but I'm myself.","The type of music I make, it's not just straight-up rapping. There's emotion in it. That's why people feel each song differently. I get all my vibes from rock music, you know? All my melodies and all that.","A whole bunch of 'ayes' and a whole bunch of 'yeahs.' That's it. That's all I do. I say yeah. I tell myself that I'm not gon' go over 80. I say, like, 79 yeahs, and it works. We what you call mumble rappers. So you say 'yeah' after everything and make it rhyme no matter what it is.","There's a lot of haters in Philly, but it's a lot of people that give you support - but way more haters. It's definitely a great city to be from. But it's not really a lot of people that come out of there. So when you, like, make it out of Philadelphia, everywhere else is easy.","I want to be as big as I can be. I want to be one of the biggest artists. I want to be remembered like, 'He is crazy. He is phenomenal.' I just want to be one of the biggest.","I'm a real big Marilyn Manson fan. I get a lot of my styles from him. Not even musically - living-wise, too. Marilyn Manson definitely shows me you shouldn't care what nobody say. I watched a bunch of his interviews, and he's not just an artist; he's one of the most intelligent people I ever saw in my life.","I saw Marilyn Manson. He had, like, the platinum grills, and that's when I got my first ones. And honestly, I didn't even buy them. My grandma bought those. I paid her back right away, though.","I like a lot of ratchet, trap music. Definitely 21 Savage. We need some music like that. ManMan Savage. A lot of the Atlanta scene. But Philly, too.","I never wanted to be no rapper.","Some guy was just like, 'You rap fast, man. Like a little machine gun,' and from that moment, I was Lil Uzi.","I'm already popular in my city. I was just trying to get rich. Man, I'm not gonna lie to you; I didn't really want to go back to school. I mean, my family was mad about that. Because, you know, you tell your family you want to rap, and they look at you like you're crazy.","The first album I bought, I didn't even buy it. My grandma got Mike Jones and Bow Wow's 'Wanted' a little later. Matter of fact Ying Yang Twins' 'U.S.A. Still United' was the first album, but Mike Jones was the first album I really love.","I enjoy 'down South' music.","Wherever you're from, you adapt to your environment. It definitely made my music a little bit more explicit. Because I really was in North Philly, I listened to State Property and stuff. Everything my dad listened to, I listened to.","I got different moods. Like, if I'm in a good mood, I listen to 'Up' by Thug. If I'm not in a good mood, I'll listen to 'King TROUP' - that's a real emotional one.","I don't know... Philly's a little different. It's a little bit more competitive. Everybody's got something to prove. In Atlanta, you see stars every day walking down the street; it's normal.","I played the coronet first, and then I upgraded to the trumpet. First song I learned on there was 'Hot Cross Buns.'","You can't say I look like this person or sound like this person exactly because I made it my own. I'm pretty, pretty influenced by myself right now.","I really didn't want to rap; I was just a regular kid. My friend - his name is William Aston - we went to the same high school together, and he was rapping. He put out a freestyle over Chris Brown's 'Look at Me Now,' and it was fire, and the whole school went crazy.","Mike Jones, Ying Yang Twins, then a little later, Wiz Khalifa and Meek Mill, too. It was the repetitive stuff with Mike Jones when he would give out his number, and I also like his style. Back then, actually, I still think du-rags, grillz, and stuff like that are cool.","I got a lot of influences. I got relevant influences today. I got influences that you wouldn't even think of. I'm very influenced by Marilyn Manson. His style is ridiculous. Like, honestly, if you want me to keep it 100, Marilyn Manson has as much style as Kanye West and Pharrell Williams.","I really didn't want to rap; I was just a regular kid.","My first CD that I had was the Ying Yang Twinz, and my grandma bought it for me. Honestly, I think my grandma got it from a thrift store or something. She just got it for me. It was in downtown Philadelphia. And I would listen to it. I liked it. None of my friends did, though, but I liked it.","Honestly, if you want me to keep it 100, Marilyn Manson has as much style as Kanye West and Pharrell Williams. He has a lot of style. I'm telling you, it's crazy. It might be a little darker, but it's crazy.","I remember, when I first rapped, I was writing raps. I don't write raps at all; I stopped early. I don't know - it seems like every day I find something a little bit easier.","If I'm talking about girls and stuff, it's usually the truth. So now, you know, if you hear my songs, you are gonna appreciate it differently because usually, it's the truth.","In my elementary days, I took a liking to rock & roll music. I dabbed into Marilyn Manson, which became my favorite.","I just take rock songs and mix it with hip-hop and a little bit of R&B.","Atlanta is down south, the club. So the most thing played down there is club music. Everybody wants a hit.","The thing that makes me different from any other rapper is that I usually talk real crazy in my songs.","There's enough money for everybody. See, I can't do what Yachty does. But then again, Yachty can't do what I do.","Everybody really don't rock with each other in Philly - that's a problem. 'Cause me being in Atlanta now, I stay in Atlanta, and I get to see everybody work with everybody no matter what."],"Lil Wayne":["I'm blessed and I thank God for every day for everything that happens for me.","I like people that enjoy life, 'cause I do the same.","I'm a gangster, and gangsters don't ask questions.","Don't make an opinion on me if you don't know nothin' about me.","I always believe that to be the best, you have to smell like the best, dress like the best, act like the best. When you throw your trash in the garbage can, it has to be better than anybody else who ever threw trash in the garbage can.","Life is a lot like skateboarding.","The more time you spend contemplating what you should have done... you lose valuable time planning what you can and will do.","I go wherever my creativity takes me.","I am very humble, and I am very gracious and very grateful for everything that happens to me and about me and around me.","Don't judge me. You wanna judge me, put on a black gown and get a gavel. Get in line with the rest of them that's about to judge me. I got court dates every other month. It's me against the world - that's how I feel.","Hate is only a form love that hasn't found a way to express itself logically.","I'm an addict, I'm addicted to success. Thankfully, there's no rehab for success.","I don't take nothin' from no one. I do what I wanna do. And I'm gonna do that until the day I die. And if I can't do that, then I'll just die.","Jail didn't make me find God, He's always been there. They can lock me up, but my spirit and my love can never be confined to prison walls.","We're here to live. We're here to do, we're here to be.","I look at things as 'Everything is meant to be.'","I don't want to be understood because if people understand me, they get tired of me.","You're either living or you're dead.","As long as people remember me forever, that will be enough for me.","Let me do me.","I'm not an example for how people should live their lives. Never in my life would I ever set out to be an example for people on how to live their lives. If you need an example for how to live, then you just shouldn't have been born. Straight up.","I know it's an experience that I need to have if God's putting me through it.","I don't think life is about a pace, living slow or fast. I think you just live, y'know what I mean?","Nothing scares me but God.","You supposed to be able to do anything in this world. That's what Martin Luther King told me.","I don't like to stop. I believe you stop when you die.","A lot of women don't know how to love because there's deep reasons for them not knowing how to love. And what I mean by deep reasons is deep and dark reasons.","I just always expect the best because I'm a competitor and if I'm competing, then obviously I'm trying to be better in everything.","I just feel out of this world sometimes.","I don't look for signs. But when things happen, I say, 'OK, something must be right.' Or 'OK, something must be wrong.'","I believe in God and his son, Jesus.","Honestly, I don't listen to nobody else's music but my own. It's kind of like sports to me. You don't see Kobe Bryant at a LeBron James game - he just works on his own game. And that's what I do. I only listen to me, so I can criticize and analyze and all those things.","I was still in school after I dropped my first solo album.","Trying to tear down the past prohibits you from building up your future.","I always knew I couldn't sing, but I also knew I had a voice that isn't heard by many, and that I could learn how to stretch it and make songs sound good.","I like being misunderstood.","I feel like everything I do is successful and productive. It's gonna be hard to tell me I'm slipping.","I don't think I've ever googled myself.","I don't think nothing. I just do my work.","I don't have to prove anything.","One thing about a skater: they never quit. So a skater, to sum it up, is awesome.","I do not consider myself a literal genius.","I believe music should reflect yourself in some way and not just yourself at the given time. I feel that when you die or when you're going, someone's supposed to listen to that music and know everything about you. And I just try to get that across.","I am my city. Nobody from my city wants to hear about my city.","I've been criticized for the things I chose and things I've chosen to do.","My aim is just to make good music every single time.","I watch ESPN all day long.","They say I'm the Hottest MC in the Game. If you label me that, I will live up to it. Trust me.","I believe that music is another form of news. Music is another form of journalism to me so I have to cover all the areas with my album.","The most bizarre thing I've ever read about myself is that I was dead. That was kind of weird to read that I'm dead - mostly because I was reading it.","I have accomplished all that I have set out to accomplish and more.","I'm kinda mad that I had to wait 28 years to jump on a skateboard.","Everybody know, I don't do no promoting. I don't ever have to promote nothing, that's the beauty of Lil Wayne.","Things I say have value and I would love for you to value them, however you get it.","Miami has embraced me and I love them for that.","I'm so greedy, I'm hungry, I'm young.","Where I come from, the block become your daddy.","I want to make sure my family's straight.","I'm always creative.","I always do my rap from the outside looking in. Like I do my rap as if I'm looking at me rap.","I love to work.","If I have a rap album I'm dropping, then I want it to be the best rap album.","I want to be a skater."],"Lil' Kim":["I am blessed to have so many great things in my life - family, friends and God. All will be in my thoughts daily.","I am definitely the queen. I definitely see myself as the queen.","Like, I get along with everybody. I respect everybody, but at the same time, I carry myself with an aura that demands respect, too.","I love spending time with my dog, my niece and my family. I'm very family-oriented.","I respect everybody, but at the same time, I carry myself with an aura that demands respect, too.","I love to reinvent myself, and that's because I am a very free person. I do what I feel, and I love who I am.","I like to live righteous. And I just want everyone to know I'm not trying to get out of anything.","The streets made me. They stay at me. There's nothing that's gonna take away from my legacy. I'm sorry. It is what it is. I'm dying this way. With the crown on my head, nobody can take nothing away from me. It is what it is. I am who I am. Bottom line.","I like bowling. I suck at it, but I like it. You know what's so funny? I have days when I'm absolutely great at doing it, and then I have days when I just don't understand it.","I really want people to understand that nobody is perfect and that things happen in life beyond our control.","I love doing things people don't expect.","I'm a girly girl. I'm strong, but I'm very timid. Very dainty.","I have low self-esteem and I always have. Guys always cheated on me with women who were European-looking. You know, the long-hair type. Really beautiful women that left me thinking, 'How I can I compete with that?' Being a regular black girl wasn't good enough.","Money talks. This is the thing, at the end of the day, I do what I have to do, and I'mma keep doing what I have to do.","I love being the underdog sometimes.","A lot of people let me down... A lot of people I thought were my friends turned on me.","I haven't had sex in eight months. To be honest, I now prefer to go bowling.","It was a very emotional dinner... Everyone shared personal stories about her and gave her words of encouragement and inspiration. Everyone tried to remain positive.","The one thing I do like is lotion and moisture on my hands and face. I love to have my face moisturized. I like different ones. I like Natura Bisse.","I think people have a misconception of me, period. My life has been a whirlwind sometimes, but it's different to what people think. I definitely feel like there's a misconception about me and who I am.","But this is Miami, you can't come to Miami and not show any skin. You gotta show something. If you're all covered up in this heat, you're gonna make me pass out out just to look at you. It's sweaty in Miami-but the diamonds will keep me cool.","Honestly, I can't survive without my MAC gloss, pigment - sometimes MAC powder. But definitely my gloss and pigment and liner. I don't do mascara all the time. I do when I wear no lashes. I use the mascara, but when I wear lashes, I don't always do mascara, because it makes it real heavy sometimes.","I want all my friends, family and fans to know that I am in good spirits and I will be fine.","All my life, men have told me I wasn't pretty enough - even the men I was dating. And I'd be like, 'Well, why are you with me, then?' It's always been men putting me down just like my dad. To this day when someone says I'm cute, I can't see it. I don't see it no matter what anybody says.","I always go to church on Sundays and Bible study on Tuesdays.","The artist I wanna be like is Michael Jackson. I'll get the house with the roller coaster and the rides and a disco, and I'll invite all my friends and just stay at home.","I've always expressed my love for fashion through my music.","Today begins a new saga in my life which I expect to strengthen me and allow me time for reflection... I plan to write music while in prison, read and pray regularly and will come out a stronger, more confident woman.","I know I always say my occupation is not dancing, but dancing is in my heart, dancing makes me feel good.","One thing about me is that I'm very much like the Black Madonna. I love to reinvent myself and that's because I am a very free person.","Lil' Kim is my stage name and a character I use when I'm out working my livelihood.","I love reinventing my music and myself as well, and that's something my fans love about me.","My fan mail is what keeps me going.","Sometimes I'll be driving and a lyric will come into my head, and I will have to pull over and record it on my phone.","I'm blessed enough to been in the game for a while and still have my beautiful fans and still have the respect. That's something that gets me going. I'm also fortunate enough to take vacation and take a little hiatus.","'Dancing With The Stars' is a little family. The cast, we're all together - we're a really friendly competition.","My love for the female hip hop movement has always been genuine.","I ain't acting when I'm on stage. That's why all the little love bugs who'll come and see me at Lovebox love me. They know it's the real me.","When you are a real artist who is serious about your craft, you love good music. Period.","Sometimes, I don't even want to put on makeup. And sometimes, I feel so unattractive and blah.","From being in the industry as a teenager, I'm so used to getting makeup done all day."],"Lil' Romeo":["I love college life.","Dreams can come true.","My dad and my uncles used to always be in the studio at my house.","We would make songs, and the producers said we should play it for my dad. I was kind of scared, I didn't know what to think cuz we were just joking around.","Family always gonna be there.","I always have to bring back an all-A report card.","Don't change for nobody.","I have a lot of gadgets, remote controls for everything - the curtains, pool cover - it's like The Jetsons!","I run in the morning, lift weights in the afternoon, basketball training at night, and then lift weights again at night.","I don't bring anything expensive to the dorms.","I love romantic comedies."],"Lila Acheson Wallace":["A painting is like a man. If you can live without it, then there isn't much point in having it.","If I displayed this cup, I might look at it once or twice a week. By using it, I get pleasure from it continually.","I knew right away that it was a gorgeous idea."],"Lili Reinhart":["I don't think any one 'ship' - like a Bughead or a Barchie or Varchie fans - should give up hope at any time because you never know.","I actually didn't go to prom. I didn't have the chance.","No one's forcing me or any other celebrity to take time out of their day to say 'Hi' to these fans or do these things. It's just something we do nine times out of 10 because we love and appreciate our fans.","I usually tape about 99 percent of my auditions at my house. I have a camera and record myself, and my mom reads the other lines off-camera. Then I send it to my agent and manager, and they send it to the casting director, and we see how it goes from there.","I really would like to be on Broadway someday.","I just hope to keep doing film and TV and eventually Broadway. It's definitely what I want to do for the rest of my life.","I remember being in middle and high school and hearing Demi Lovato speak up about her mental illness, and that was comforting.","Going to Comic-Con was mind-blowing, seeing all these fans and all these people who know my name.","You don't need to ever justify the way you feel.","I have money in my bank account. I have my own apartment. I have friends. I still go through and experience depression. You don't have to be ashamed of it.","I have anxiety.","I'm not going to sit here and go to college for something that I don't care about.","There came a point when I called my mom, and I was like, 'I need to come home. I'm not OK. I'm not good right now. My mental health isn't good.'","I've seen a therapist at different points in my life for different reasons.","I am on medication - I've talked about that before - just to help my anxiety, so I'm not depressed all the time.","I didn't learn about depression or anxiety at school. So when I had to go to my parents to say 'I need help, I need to go to therapy,' I felt like this weird, messed up kid. And I wasn't, but I felt that way.","I'm a picky eater, so, often, if I can't find something to eat at catering, I order pizza.","I order pizza a lot to set.","I developed slight body dysmorphia - when I would break out, I couldn't look at myself in the mirror for a couple of months at a time. I remember doing my makeup before school in the dark, which is an awful idea, but it's because I didn't want to see myself in that bright light.","I have cystic acne, and sometimes when I have a breakout, it triggers me back to that time when I was a teen and I feel so self-conscious - like the whole world is looking at my bad skin. I've definitely not gone out of the house because of a breakout, which is horrible.","I never had a huge circle of friends, so I really just tried to cherish and not take for granted the close friends I did have, who were really supportive and understanding.","Going back, I wish I could have been in the moment a little bit more. I can't change it, but hindsight definitely makes me appreciative of the moment now - even if it's hard, or exhausting, it's all a part of the experience.","Our Betty Cooper is still the girl next door - she literally lives next to Archie. And she's the blonde all-American girl; she's so sweet and forgiving, gives people the benefit of the doubt and second chances, wears her heart on her sleeve. But she's also incredibly broken on the inside, for many different reasons.","Actors devote a lot of our time and energy to the work that we do, but there shouldn't come a sense of entitlement from fans that we owe them every second of our lives.","Yes, we as actors are so appreciative of our fans, but there comes a point where, if we've been working all day, we don't owe 100 percent of ourselves to anyone, and that shouldn't be expected.","I definitely have had fights with best friends. Some of them have led to me and said friend not being friends anymore, but it always turned out to be for the better. I think if you fight with someone, and you can just never reconcile, that just goes to show that maybe you shouldn't have been friends in the first place.","I think people who are destined to be friends, that are best friends, that genuinely, truly are invested in each other as human beings - a fight won't separate you forever. I've definitely had fights with my best friend, but it has never made us sever ties.","Some people say the things I do are annoying because I'm intentionally trying too hard to be relatable, but I'm really not.","It's never really been my intention; I've never gone out of my way to be relatable to anyone. I just say what I want, and I'm pretty blunt about things.","I really look up to Ashley Graham and how she promotes her body and flaunts it. She's beautiful and stunning, and I'm not going to say I love her body on Instagram and talk about it poorly in my personal life.","I use an acne cleanser because I do get breakouts, especially when I'm filming, and I use a toner to kind of help keep my oil under control with oil.","My mom would drive me from Cleveland to New York City and use my dad's hotel points for auditions. They were the most supportive parents that I could have. Without them, I wouldn't have gotten anywhere.","I'm always going to try to be as happy and grateful to fans, but I'm also just trying to live my life.","I had had to quit a few jobs in North Carolina because of how anxious they made me.","I was making myself a hotdog and pulling some curly fries out of the oven, and I got the call from manager, and she said, 'You got it. You're Betty Cooper.' It felt so unreal.","I think I was 10 when I did my first community play, and then I started booking bigger roles in these plays, and people were telling me and my parents that I was talented. And I was like, 'Well, this is something I wanna do.'","I was always a performer kid - like, annoyingly so. I would put on shows for my family and direct my friends in little plays, and my little sister, I'd make up dances with her. But when I was 12, that was when I started taking it seriously, and my mom for some reason believed in me and helped me find an agent in Cleveland, which did nothing for me.","I think it's refreshing that it's not called 'The Archie Show.' It's called 'Riverdale,' not 'Archie,' which is good.","The first time I moved to L.A., I was there for five months, and my health got so bad because of how depressed I was.","What you want, what feels good to you - it's all going to change with every partner you have.","It takes a good 35-40 minutes to do my iconic ponytail every day.","I don't drink coffee, so I have been known to have a Coca Cola on set at 6:30 A.M. in order to wake myself up.","I wear sweatpants to set every day.","I can't say I've watched 'Twin Peaks.' I feel like I wouldn't be comfortable doing so until after I'm done with 'Riverdale.'","The world that we've created - of 'Riverdale,' and of this town, and of these characters - are so vastly developed. And we're diving so deep into them that fans are just really gonna die for it.","Why aren't we talking about it in health classes in school? That's just as important as learning about physical health and nutrition. Why aren't we learning about our minds and our mental health and mental illnesses? I just think that it's something that very much needs to go hand in hand.","It's always been something that I'm so able and willing to talk about that it's kind of foreign to me that people hide their depression and anxiety.","The response from the beginning has been really, really wonderful and positive. People have always really responded to me talking about mental health.","Being a young woman in Hollywood is intimidating.","Taking ownership of your feelings is so vital to getting better.","I'm not grateful for depression, but it honestly made me work harder and gave me the drive that I have to succeed and to make it work.","I have a best friend in my life who I know is my soulmate.","I suffer from depression and anxiety, and having a show and having a character that portrays a young woman who is dealing with that and the consequences of it - how it affects her friendships and her relationships with her mom and her sister - it's beautiful to see that.","I think, growing up, the female friendships that I saw on television were portrayed as catty and vicious.","I remember growing up and seeing Vanessa Hudgens' Bongo campaign in magazines. I think I probably put a few of her posters on my wall, to be honest. I wore Bongo growing up, as did my older sister - I would get her hand-me-downs as well as my own new pieces when I went shopping.","High school was difficult for me because I was in the thick of dealing with my depression and anxiety.","I never had had a large group of friends, so I often felt a little out of place and like I was in a different mindset from everyone else around me because I was so focused on my acting career.","I take, like, two baths a day. Is that weird? I don't know.","I journal a lot for nobody but myself. Just to get my thoughts out and to clear my mind. That's very therapeutic to me.","I like to escape to the beach and kind of ground myself whenever I can.","I think there's something about going on a hike and looking at a city view or looking at the ocean that brings you back to earth and kind of reminds you that your problems are quite small in retrospect.","I use an acne cleanser. I've always had that St. Ives apricot scrub. But I have bad skin sometimes.","There's a definite rift in 'Riverdale.' There's a civil war between the Southside and the Northside. And Jughead being on the Southside and Betty's on the Northside, it becomes a bit of a 'Romeo and Juliet' situation.","It's called a private life for a reason - it's mine, and it's special and sacred.","I've had social anxiety forever - I don't thrive in social or party settings.","My relationships are between me and whomever I'm with, not between me and the world.","For teenage kids, they feel a pressure to sweep things under the rug because they feel like they're not important enough to have problems.","Your feelings are validated by the fact that you're feeling them.","I never had to do anything specific to craft my 'image.' I wanted people to know that I was a goofball, that I didn't take myself too seriously, and that I love what I do. On my Twitter and Instagram, whenever I can, I try and show myself. I'm not trying to be an Instagram model.","People post things on Instagram that they know people are going to like.","I just love spending the day at the beach and then staying inside all night.","Growing up, I watched a lot of TLC - I loved 'Four Weddings' and 'Hoarding: Buried Alive.' They're so binge-able.","I grew up with a very small, select group of friends that I kept my whole life.","I have a sugar addiction - when I don't eat sugar, my body literally shakes. It's not something I'm proud of.","When I get really passionate about something, the audition process is really strenuous and hard on me because I feel so much for the project, and I become so attached to it. It's hard. It's stressful because you want it so badly, and you're crafting this character that you're falling in love with.","When you meet your best friend in real life, or you meet your soulmate, you just know it, and you feel it.","When my skin is breaking out pretty bad, I try to leave it alone as much as I can. I don't want to pack on product after product, I think that makes it worse and kind of overwhelms your skin.","It's weird how much social media affects someone's career. Deals and jobs are sometimes based off how many followers you have, which is a little sad. I would rather that not be the case, but I understand that it's important.","I hate wearing too much makeup or caked-on foundation.","My everyday look is casual, and I try not to wear makeup if I don't have to. I'll cover a zit with a little concealer, but I don't wear foundation on a daily basis. I maybe fill in my eyebrows.","I love to apply my foundation with BeautyBlenders - I just think it gives the most natural kind of glow, but I've learned from being on set that you should use a damp BeautyBlender but that you should dampen it with rosewater. It just kind of brings your skin to life a little bit more.","I'm kind of a warrior for love, and I wear my heart on my sleeve.","My parents just had faith in me, and thank God they did. They weren't stage parents in the slightest.","School was a big source of anxiety for me. I hated school. I have social anxiety, and it developed when I was a kid. I had trouble going to birthday parties. It was always there. I begged my mom to let me be home-schooled at one point for a semester because I was so miserable at school.","I'm the kind of person, if I don't like you, unfortunately you know that.","Everything I'm thinking in my head goes onto my face, so you can see right through me.","Sometimes people will approach me on the street and ask me very personal questions about my dating life. Fans talk to me like they know me, and it's like, 'You don't know me. You know my character, but you really don't know me.'","I want to be relatable. I want people to know who I am, but that doesn't mean you get to know everything about me and my life. I think that there's a fine line.","People are going to criticize you no matter what, so I'm going to say whatever the hell I want to say.","With any teen show, there's going to be drama and heartache.","I moved across the country when I was 16, so I left my high school and finished school online in order to pursue my acting more.","It's just a matter of finding the styles, finding the fabrics, shapes, that accentuate your own body. You can't be altered, but the clothes can.","I grew up one of three girls, and none of them were into comic books, so I wasn't exposed to that world.","I feel like every time I tweeted something that was a little opinionated, or every time I posted something on Tumblr that seemed a little private, it's all of a sudden making news relationship-wise.","A man in a position of power over me used that said power to try and take advantage of me."],"Lili Simmons":["There's an indie movie I did called 'Fat Kid Rules the World,' which was based on a teen book, and it's a fabulous story, and hopefully it'll go to theaters because it is an amazing story.","I remember liking 'A Cinderella Story' with Hilary Duff a lot when I was younger. I loved that movie, but maybe it was because of Chad Michael Murray. It was a really sweet movie, and I always liked Hilary Duff.","I don't know if I was popular in high school. My school was actually not really clique-y, which was nice. I went to a very artsy school, so everyone was kind of friends with each other. I was trying to be popular more, like, in junior high and elementary school and dealt with all that backstabbing and drama.","I think teen girls will like 'Geek Charming' because they really focus on the 'populars' and nerdy people and people who are in between the nerds and between the populars. So it really hits every category of what girls are going through in high school."],"Lili Taylor":["You can rest a lot in an hour or have a whole day and not do it properly. One way I get a quality recharge is to connect with nature. To experience something that's bigger than me.","Two things I'm trying to work on are openness and flexibility.","I love Central Park. I spend a lot of time in there. I try and get in there whenever I can.","The weird thing about this business - and I'm sure this operates in many other things, but it's very present and acute in this business - is that a lot of people don't realize that they have power. Particularly actors.","To do work that's not going to be fulfilling doesn't make sense.","When it's working, what acting is really about is getting into the essence of a moment in a creative, joyous way - through whatever frees you up.","If someone puts up $100 million on a movie, they're gonna be concerned about whether they'll get it back. So they're not gonna make a movie about three girls, you know?","It's been very important for me to follow my gut or my heart, or whichever organ you want to go by.","I see my job as an actor to be as good a channel as I can be. Acting is a gift, and I have respect for it.","I tried to do the commercial thing. But I don't want to keep shoving Twinkies down everyone's throat. People are hungry for something of more substance.","Cannes is a very strange place. I tried to show up as best I could and to try not to be cynical.","I do believe there's good in all of us, even if it's layered over so thickly.","As a woman, a lot of stories haven't been told and we've got a lot of catching up to do.","I guess the characters I play may be at the more destructive edge of the spectrum, more damaged or whatever, but I find a lot of female roles uninteresting.","There's been a slow death in a way. On the positive side, there are films getting into the Academy Awards that wouldn't have, but on the negative side, financiers are now dominant and making all the decisions. I can't count the ways a director's vision is compromised.","I like to play smart, three-dimensional women. I also like to play roles where the women are a little crazy. I just have a feel for crazy people.","We need art. We've been telling stories since the beginning. As human beings, we need it for our survival.","It's tricky to say 'never,' but I will never have plastic surgery.","I felt that the biological clock was some myth to keep me from doing what I wanted to do. And so I rebelled against it in the '90s. I thought it was a backlasher, some sort of faulty data. But it's real. I'm glad I woke up before my body was just like 'uh-uh.'"],"Lilith Saintcrow":["It's always difficult to say goodbye, especially when one has spent a long time - literally years, in the case of a series - inside a character or two, suffering and celebrating with them.","Fight scenes are very physical for me. Sometimes I require my own body to move through them before I can tell where a character's likely to feel it.","If something is visceral and unsettling for me, my job is to not look away, not to punk out. Sometimes the dark things come from places inside me, experiences I've had, that need to be transformed.","As much as I devoured comics, I read non-graphic books exponentially more, so I'm not sure I can credit or blame them. Comics, however, taught me a lot about what makes a story arc work and how to bring a story to its natural resting place between issues."],"Lilla Crawford":["I've been performing my whole life. My mom signed me up for a theater program when I was five - I was the evil queen in 'Once Upon a Mattress.'","In 'Billy Elliot,' there were, like, 24 kids, so that was crazy. In 'Annie,' there's nine of us; we're all great friends, and we hang out all the time. We really are just sisters.","Emily Blunt helped me study for a Spanish test, and I got an A+ on it!","I was definitely very intimidated, but the instant Meryl Streep said 'Hi' to me, it all went away.","I want to be like Sutton Foster, Kristin Chenoweth or Anne Hathaway and do everything that has to do with performing.","Eataly is the greatest - it's like food galore there. They have all of these little stations, like a pasta area and a pizza area. And they have the best gelato.","Every time somebody would ask me what I want to be when I grow up, I would always say, 'I want to be on Broadway!'","First, I started taking dance classes, and then I started taking singing lessons. Then my mom put me into a year-round theatre program where I did seven shows.","I really like 'Hard-Knock Life' because I get to perform with all of the other girls, and it's such a strong number.","I do a kind of homeschooling where some of it's on the computer and some of it's classes around the city. So sometimes I'll have a class in the morning or do school at home.","I have always liked Taylor Swift - there is just something about her that is very genuine and sweet. She also has naturally curly hair like me, so that's cool.","I don't really have a favorite pop artist - I just listen to some pop songs here and there. Mostly, though, it's Beyonce and show tunes.","For me, I think the best part of all and the most fun was just being a part of such an amazing movie and such an amazing show because 'Into The Woods' is just so incredible.","At my school, they have an ice cream special sometimes, and they have this ice cream sandwich, except the sandwich part is like an Oreo and the inside like cookies n' cream ice cream. I love that.","I was on vacation in New York when my agent called asking if I wanted to go right in and audition for 'Billy Elliot,' so I was lucky to be there.","When I get older, I want to be a Kristin Chenoweth and Sutton Foster - you know how they do all of it? I just want to do anything that has to do with performing.","When I found out that they were doing a revival of 'Annie,' I decided to audition just for fun and see how it turned out. So I auditioned, and I got a callback after callback after callback. And I just wanted to be a part of the show; I didn't care what role.","In the Depression especially, I think you learn to face problems and not run away from them.","When I saw my first Broadway show, 'Beauty and the Beast,' I was like, 'Okay, I'm definitely gonna do this.' After that, I did little shows and started auditioning.","One day, I saw a magic show, and I was like, 'I have to learn how to do this!' Every time I went to Las Vegas, I had to get at least two or three tricks from the magic shops.","When I first put on the red wig and the red dress, I couldn't believe it was happening. I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is the dress everyone knows 'Annie' for, and I'm wearing it.'","I used to be obsessed with Johnny Depp. I never thought of him as this normal guy. I just always imagined him as someone who lives in a far-off land and doesn't even exist.","I want to be in a Tim Burton movie so bad."],"Lillete Dubey":["Everything is possible. Anything is possible at any time and at any time in life. That's such an affirmative kind of feeling.","I believe divinity is within us.","A lot of people in India are not that into non-Indian films or Western films.","You are not dead until you are in that grave, so don't close the book. Don't give up.","The Indian film industry is very, very vibrant. It is a mix like it is in Hollywood - there is a lot of highly commercial cinema.","My father was the artistic one. At a very young age, my father realised I had a strong voice and made me learn Hindustani vocal. I was five. I have Dad to thank for introducing me to the finer things in life.","I was a rebel. I went to Carmel Convent in Delhi where I was a complete rebel. I thought I was 12 going on 18. I wanted to go out with friends older to me, stay out late - my parents were horrified. It was then that we began having our first disagreements.","India's a fascinating country. It's constantly changing, but there's still a lot of superstition and backwards thinking.","Plays which are universal tempt me. 'August: Osage County' is a play which is relevant to the urban Indian set up.","All actors know that the real adrenaline rush is in doing theatre. There is an immediate connect, and a role in a play, for an actor, is the biggest temptation.","It is hard to get good actors who also do television, ads and films. Theatre requires six weeks of rehearsal for a play.","Ahmedabad is a cultured city with a rich heritage of craft and theatre.","I am not a regular at film festivals.","We are a family of professionals, especially doctors. Thanks to my father, I got exposed to a whole lot of things. I call him a Renaissance man.","Theatre is my first love. I don't understand why people say that theatre can't give you money.","There is so much freedom I enjoy in theatre. In films, the roles are limited.","I'm always thinking, 'What next,' even while working on one play or shooting for a film.","I first watched 'Adhe Adhure' in college. I loved it, and it stayed with me ever since. I decided that I would some day direct this play - not in English, but in Hindi.","I like taking up challenges. I prefer working with scripts that are different and veer from the tried and tested. So far, it's always worked.","So many people ask me this, but I tell them I look forward to each day because I love what I do."],"Lilli Palmer":["I sweat. If anything comes easy to me I mistrust it.","Fidelity is a gift not a requirement."],"Lillian Gish":["A happy life is one spent in learning, earning, and yearning.","What you get is a living, what you give is a life.","The stage was our school, our home, our life.","You can get through life with bad manners, but it's easier with good manners.","The older I get, the more I believe in what I can't explain or understand, even more than the things that are explainable and understandable.","Young man, if God had wanted you to see me that way, he would have put your eyes in your bellybutton.","Never get caught acting."],"Lillian Gordy Carter":["Middle age is when a guy keeps turning off lights for economical rather than romantic reasons.","Sure I'm for helping the elderly. I'm going to be old myself someday.","We may not return the affection of those who like us, but we always respect their good judgment.","I know folks all have a tizzy about it, but I like a little bourbon of an evening. It helps me sleep. I don't much care what they say about it.","Jimmy says he'll never tell a lie. Well, I lie all the time. I have to - to balance the family ticket.","If I had one wish for my children, it would be that each of them would reach for goals that have meaning for them as individuals.","I love all my children, but some of them I don't like.","Every time I think that I am getting old, and gradually going to the grave, something else happens."],"Lillian Hellman":["People change and forget to tell each other.","What a word is truth. Slippery, tricky, unreliable. I tried in these books to tell the truth.","I cannot and will not cut my conscience to fit this year's fashion.","God forgives those who invent what they need.","It is best to act with confidence, no matter how little right you have to it.","Truth made you a traitor as it often does in a time of scoundrels.","It is not good to see people who have been pretending strength all their lives lose it even for a minute.","If you believe, as the Greeks did, that man is at the mercy of the gods, then you write tragedy. The end is inevitable from the beginning. But if you believe that man can solve his own problems and is at nobody's mercy, then you will probably write melodrama.","Things start out as hopes and end up as habits.","There are people who eat the earth and eat all the people on it like in the Bible with the locusts. And other people who stand around and watch them eat.","Since when do we have to agree with people to defend them from injustice?","Nobody outside of a baby carriage or a judge's chamber believes in an unprejudiced point of view.","Lonely people, in talking to each other, can make each other lonelier.","If I had to give young writers advice, I would say don't listen to writers talking about writing or themselves.","I like people who refuse to speak until they are ready to speak.","Success isn't everything but it makes a man stand straight.","Belief is a moral act for which the believer is to be held responsible.","Cynicism is an unpleasant way of saying the truth.","Unjust. How many times I've used that word, scolded myself with it. All I mean by it now is that I don't have the final courage to say that I refuse to preside over violations against myself, and to hell with justice.","Nothing you write, if you hope to be good, will ever come out as you first hoped.","My father was often angry when I was most like him.","It is a mark of many famous people that they cannot part with their brightest hour.","We are a people who do not want to keep much of the past in our heads. It is considered unhealthy in America to remember mistakes, neurotic to think about them, psychotic to dwell on them.","Failure in the theater is more dramatic and uglier than any other form of writing. It costs so much, you feel so guilty.","They're fancy talkers about themselves, writers. If I had to give young writers advice, I would say don't listen to writers talking about writing or themselves.","You lose your manners when you are poor."],"Lillian Russell":["Time to open up a new chapter in life, and to explore a larger centre.","We all have a fear of the unknown what one does with that fear will make all the difference in the world.","Learn to take responsibility for emotions, and to manage energies, always working within present resources."],"Lillian Smith":["When you stop learning, stop listening, stop looking and asking questions, always new questions, then it is time to die.","To believe in something not yet proved and to underwrite it with our lives: it is the only way we can leave the future open.","We need not feel ashamed of flirting with the zodiac. The zodiac is well worth flirting with.","Education is a private matter between the person and the world of knowledge and experience, and has little to do with school or college.","Man, born of woman, has found it a hard thing to forgive her for giving him birth. The patriarchal protest against the ancient matriarch has borne strange fruit through the years.","The human heart dares not stay away too long from that which hurt it most. There is a return journey to anguish that few of us are released from making.","Faith and doubt both are needed - not as antagonists, but working side by side to take us around the unknown curve.","The lack of belief is a defect that ought to be concealed when it cannot be overcome.","Rich folks always talk hard times."],"Lillie Langtry":["Anyone's life truly lived consists of work, sunshine, exercise, soap, plenty of fresh air, and a happy contented spirit.","I am happy as happiness goes, for a woman who has so many memories and who lives the lonely life of an actress.","No person in the world ever lost anything by being nice to me.","Feed the dogs. I hate to hear them barking like that.","Why in the world would anyone want to photograph an old woman like me?","The most lasting and pure gladness comes to me from my gardens.","Anyone who limits her vision to memories of yesterday is already dead.","I was beautiful. Now, because I am old, I take no shame in so saying.","I found my interest lapse in both acting and racing.","I have known great things and wonderful persons, and I have known homage.","It was so kind of you to mention that I don't wear stays. What's the point? If you squeeze it in at one point, it only comes out at the other.","My husband is a general's chauffeur somewhere in France.","Will I return to England? I don't know. I'll think it over.","I do not regret one moment of my life.","They saw me, those reckless seekers of beauty, and in a night I was famous.","On one night of my debut the Prince of Wales, the Princess, and the duchess of London came to see me. They loved me for what I was and what I gave them.","You wouldn't believe how the town was named for me. I was met by the whole population, headed by the mayor.","I am a grandmother now, and that means age is creeping on, creeping on.","I shall fulfill my contract, no more nor less.","I felt weary of the responsibility of owning houses and was glad enough to pass mine on to others.","Sympathy is charming, but it does not make up for pain.","I have always been willing to take the blame for the things I have done.","After being so bad I could hear the angels singing.","I must hurry back to my house and my flowers in Monaco.","I know I am at the end. I shall never get better, dear.","Said I was beautiful, did he? He's being paid for treatment, not flattery.","I'm not afraid. I never liked long last acts.","It's the first time I've seen myself act, and I can't say I'm impressed.","My agent tells me I am drawing the largest salary ever paid in the halls of England. Wonderful, isn't it? for a quiet, rural gardener like myself.","I've put in as many as 40 weeks a year on stage. It is lonely and restricted, as all artistic life must necessarily be.","The sentimentalist ages far more quickly than the person who loves his work and enjoys new challenges."],"Lilly Ledbetter":["We sought justice because equal pay for equal work is an American value. That fight took me ten years. It took me all the way to the Supreme Court. And, in a 5-4 decision, they stood on the side of those who shortchanged my pay, my overtime, and my retirement just because I am a woman.","The first bill that President Obama signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. I think it says something about his priorities that the first bill he put his name on has my name on it too. As he said that day with me by his side, 'Making our economy work means making sure it works for everyone.'","Because women still earn just 77 cents for every dollar men make. Those pennies add up to real money.","Some of you may know my story: How for nineteen years, I worked as a manager for a tire plant in Alabama. And some of you may have lived a similar story: After nearly two decades of hard, proud work, I found out that I was making significantly less money than the men who were doing the same work as me.","The Supreme Court told me that I should have filed a complaint within six months of the company's first decision to pay me less even though I didn't know about it for nearly two decades.","In the end, I didn't get a dime of the money I was shortchanged."],"Lilly Pulitzer":["Being happy never goes out of style.","Style isn't just about what you wear, it's about how you live.","I am a believer that color affects people's moods.","I designed collections around whatever struck my fancy... fruits, vegetables, politics, or peacocks! I entered in with no business sense.","I can't put into words what I think about anything.","I loved my boarding school, but I didn't know what I wanted to do. I didn't have a career.","Time means nothing to me.","Seeing Michelle Obama's bright color choices, and how she made people smile and reinforced Obama's platforms of hope and change, was inspiring.","I don't like my whole life dragged out. I don't want anyone to know about me, because I don't think I'm very interesting... I like my work. I like what I gave. And that was it."],"Lilly Singh":["Love who you are, embrace who you are. Love yourself. When you love yourself, people can kind of pick up on that: they can see confidence, they can see self-esteem, and naturally, people gravitate towards you.","A big part of depression is feeling really lonely, even if you're in a room full of a million people.","You need a really solid foundation of friends and family to keep you where you need to be.","My inspiration comes from my real life experiences.","In my life I've gone through a lot of really hard times. I went through depression and had so many challenges that I overcame. And I overcame because I just decided to be happy.","Life is designed to knock you down. It will knock you down time and time again, but it doesn't matter how many times you fall - it matters how many times you get back up.","It's really important to talk to yourself and look at yourself in the mirror and love who you are.","There's no escalators - there's only staircases to success. There is no substitute for hard work.","I'm my own boss, my own editor, my own shooter, my own writer, everything. This is all stuff I learned through trial and error... failing at a lot of things has taught me how to succeed at them eventually... you roll with the punches.","I know one of the reasons I first started making Youtube videos was because no one looks like me.","I think one of the most beautiful things about YouTube is that it makes the world a smaller place. You realize that we're all different, but we're all the same. And if you think about it, it's a beautiful concept.","There is no casting director; there is no producer monitoring your upload button. Anyone that looks like anyone can upload a video. I think YouTube and the digital space does set a really good example for the rest of the industry in that sense.","I was the first South Asian female to do comedy videos on YouTube. But at the same time, all races face their barriers, and I've learned through YouTube, if it's not race, it will be sexism, if it's not sexism, it will be homophobia. It will always be something, and all voices should be heard.","I'm like, 'I think I'm just going to wear what makes me happy,' so I'm just really big on wearing things that reflect my personality, like colorful hats and weird shoes and things that I just think are fun.","You have a character who is wearing a scarf on her head on a billboard in LA, New York, Sydney and Melbourne. That's how I would face barriers being thrown at me.","When I was younger, I had this fairy tale that you can have the eight hours of sleep and be a healthy, balanced person and still achieve your goals. The reality is, that hasn't always been the case.","I recently caught myself giving a pretty girl the cold shoulder because I felt intimidated. She was so gorgeous, and it made me feel insecure. I wasn't even aware until someone pointed it out to me. I was so embarrassed! I recognized those thoughts and made a point to be more friendly to her because there was no reason to be cold.","Competition gives birth to a lot of success, and if no one ever challenged you, you wouldn't go anywhere. It makes sense to compete with others for a promotion at work. But so many women take it a step further and won't even support other women. They end up competing over things that don't make sense - like how we look.","After a long day at work, I want someone to come home, turn on my video and think, 'Oh my God, how girls get ready? This is hilarious. I love this; I'm forgetting about all my problems.'","Every day, something new gets thrown at me, and I'm like, 'How did this happen?' I've gone through some of the craziest life experiences because of YouTube.","'Unicorn Island' is the synonym for my happy place. It's a really beautiful message: that happiness is one of the hardest things you'll ever fight for, but it's the only thing worth fighting for.","Everyone's voice should be heard when it comes to racial barriers.","Happiness is the only thing worth fighting for in your life.","For anyone aspiring to be anything, I would like them to realise dreams require work. So work big time.","It's everyone's responsibility to build up other women rather than tear them down. Be self-aware and proactive. It's not wrong to have those thoughts, but you can change how you respond to those feelings. Take a mental step back, and think about why you're feeling that way.","I really have this desire to make it known that the Internet exists and YouTubers are important. And not only are YouTubers important, our followings are incredible.","Everyone can relate to the story of fighting for happiness.","I'm a South Asian female that talks about relationships and periods and dating and all these things.","Honestly, I just wear what makes me feel good. So many people come up to me, and they're like, 'Did you know you're a tomboy? You should try wearing dresses.'","I swear Kim Kardashian's first marriage lasted longer than some of my iPhone chargers.","I like to describe my stuff as observational comedy.","I think what people like about my channel is that I am not perfect. I always point to my pimple, my bad hair day... people relate to that. They are watching somebody who is exactly like them and talking about things that they experience as well.","I don't say no as much as I should. I'm an extreme workaholic. So I can be sick, and I still say yes to anything. When you are the CEO of your own company, editor of your own videos, your own writer ,and you do every role yourself, you have a hard time saying no to opportunities.","When I first started YouTubeing, the idea was, 'Oh, YouTube is going to be a stepping stone to get to other places,' and I just totally don't agree with that. I think YouTube is amazing. The digital space is amazing.","When I uploaded my very first video, I was just looking for something to make me happy. I was confused about what I was doing in my life and had earned a degree that I didn't really enjoy. With that video, I was finally doing something I was passionate about. So it was my way of self-medicating.","Regardless of where life has taken me, I'm always excited to come back to Canada. I will forever be a proud Canadian. In fact, a lot of my success comes from the fact that I come from a diverse place, and that translates into my comedy. I will always be Team Canada.","I am not looking for a relationship right now. I have no interest in putting my time or effort into another person, nor do I need another person to put energy into me, OK? Because that's what granola bars are for.","The sad reality is that girl-on-girl hate is such a big issue in schools, at work, or online, and it never made any sense to me because, as women, we know how awesome other women can be.","I don't know who came up with this idea that it's cool to hate on other girls, 'cause it's not.","I've discovered home is not a place anymore. It's the people around you.","I want to do everything I can possibly do to step outside the box.","The good thing about me is, I only do deals with people that I love to begin with.","I am pretty weird - as weird as in my videos. The only difference is Lilly is not a performer, and Superwoman is. So Superwoman is very fearless. You'll never see her nervous. You'll never see her sad. But Lilly is a human. She is the person behind Superwoman, who gets sad and tired sometimes.","I've had fans do some pretty awesome things... I once had a fan do a mock proposal for me in Mumbai, inside a McDonalds... and I've had fans give me some precious things. I had one fan give me her mother's ring; I've gotten some pretty intense stuff. And I always get drawings and scrapbooks from fans, which is also pretty cool.","A majority of my YouTube friends I've made because I made a trip down to California and literally tweeted them saying, 'Hey! Come over - let's shoot something!' And then two strangers will just meet up, talk, and shoot something.","The majority of people call or message me because they need something or they want something. You never know what people's intentions are.","I'm an extreme workaholic.","Everything I do with my day is related to Superwoman. I'm either doing conference calls or writing a script or reading a script, editing a video, shooting a video.","I just love what I do so much.","When I was younger, I always wanted to be someone in the entertainment industry.","My creative process is a bit manic at times, to be honest. I wake up Monday and Thursday stressed because I don't have a video. I usually - with the exception of maybe a handful of videos - wake up, write the video, shoot the video, edit the video, release the video all in the same day.","I want my channel to be a place people go even if they don't care about Lilly. I don't want them to have to know about Lilly or care about me as a person to enjoy my content.","The parent characters that I portray are Indian because I grew up in an Indian household. Having said that, I feel like people of all cultures would relate to those parents.","Growing up, I was always creatively inclined, and when YouTube came about, it was like getting the perfect platform to showcase what I wanted. Personally, I was going through a dark phase in my life, and I decided to make videos and basically go by the adage, 'If you want to cheer up yourself, go cheer up someone else.'","When I started out the videos, I was dealing with depression, and I wanted to make inspiring videos for others, which would end up inspiring me in turn. I wanted to show the world that it was possible to make a positive switch in life and start over.","On my Superwoman channel, I am more of a performer, I am aiming to make you guys laugh. With vlogs, it's just me and my day, boring or fun.","Superwoman is more of a performer, which Lilly isn't. Having said that, I guess both of them are completely over the top, dramatic and full of energy.","I know the video platform so, so, so well. I know the perfect mixture of how comedic a piece has to be, what the video has to be like, what the song has to sound like, to make it successful.","Independent content these days can be more successful than previously because of the power of social media. However, there are still systems in place to make sure independent artists don't get as far as signed ones.","No matter what I put out, somebody will be offended. I made a video on 10 reasons to smile, and it has dislikes. That should be an indication that there will be some who get offended no matter what you do. The best you can do as an entertainer or as someone who performs is to follow what you believe in.","If you say, 'I don't want to offend anyone,' then don't get on stage. Just ask yourself, 'Do I think it is right? Do I think it is offensive? And do I think that everyone is okay to hear this? If I truly believe this, then I should go and do this.'","When I first started, all the media I ever got was, 'Hey! There's this Indian girl. And even though she is Indian, she gets views and stuff.'","I think why my content does so well with so many different types of people is because it speaks to everyone. I'll make a Soca music reference, I'll use a Tamil word, I'll do a Jamaican Patois accent. I know about all these people, and I'm not afraid to indulge in their culture.","My job requires me to always be on. I'm always getting my makeup done for a shoot.","I love wearing makeup! It's just that if you choose not to wear it, that's OK. And if you choose to wear it, that's OK as well.","I'm a Beyonce fan, and when I'm looking at her, I'll think 'Oh my God, her life is so awesome, and she made it.'","Sometimes I'll be sitting on Facebook at home and see all these people getting married, having kids, having that life that I was told I should have. And sometimes I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Am I the stupid one here? Am I not doing what I'm supposed to do? And that's also equally as stressful.","When I was coming out of depression, I made one random video. It wasn't funny or anything, but just the idea that people I didn't know were watching it made me feel less alone than I'd felt in a long time.","You need to know who your ideal viewer is, and mine is a 14-year-old screaming female. And I'm thrilled about that. I am thrilled.","If you want to make YouTube your career, you have to accept that it is also a business. I know everyone's like, 'It's my passion, it's my hobby.' And that's fine; I support that. But if you want to make it your career, it does have a business side.","My partnership with YouTube is one that I really, really treasure and I want to carry through. I mean, I don't just say it because I work with them; I genuinely am a fan of YouTube, so that's where I'd want to see my content.","When I make my own videos, I am the writer, the editor, the lighting person, everything - that's why my videos are blurry.","I still make videos in my bedroom by choice because that's the feel of my comedy, but the opportunity to make longer format content with a production company, with a team that's a bit more elevated in that sense, is really exciting for me because it's not that it's better than what I've already been doing, but it's different.","The best way to describe my work is comedy in a very, very real way. I'm not scared to look silly on camera. I take everyday situations we all go through and put a very real twist on it - things people can relate to.","I'm actually not making fun of my real parents. I've taken stereotypical traits of my real parents, my aunts, my uncles and parents of every race and put them into these two characters, who are just over-the-top ridiculous and super-alpha parents about everything.","My fans are honestly so unique and so similar. Wherever I travel, they are so, so different but so the same.","When I posted my first video, I remember it hit 700 views after a week, and I was like, 'Oh my God, this is amazing.' I was over the moon.","I'm the type of person who doesn't hope, dream or wish for things. I work and work and work.","You are not any different. You can do anything you want. So many times, I've been asked what I think of women stand-ups. If you actually look around, there are so many female comedians starring in the biggest TV shows.","Growing up, I idolised Madhuri Dixit. She's my favourite actress, and I used to pretend I was her all the time.","I always say that when I first started, my videos were very veered towards Indian people.","On an average day, I will spend 90 percent of my waking moments working on 'Superwoman.' I'm a huge workaholic. My hobby is 'Superwoman.'","Sometimes I'm having conversations with my friends, and I feel like they can't relate to me anymore. I'm like, 'Oh, my God, let me tell you about my experience on 'Fallon'!' And they'll be like, 'Oh, my God, let me tell you about my trip to the mall!' It sometimes feels lonely.","I wanted to be a musician. I wanted to be a superstar. I wanted to be on stage. I wanted to perform. I wanted to be in movies. But as you grow up, those dreams kind of fade away, and you're hit with reality, and you're like, 'Oh, not everyone can be Lil' Bow Wow?' Fine.","I got into psychology simply because that's what my sister did, and I grew up in a family that was very, like, 'Follow your sister's footsteps.' I went to the same school she went to, did the same degree she did... really had no interest in it, to be honest.","I am absolutely terrified to move... I truly, truly believe that success lies outside of your comfort zone, and my house has been the greatest comfort zone for me.","The platform got me out of a very dark period of my life, so I love YouTube genuinely.","When I used to live in Toronto, I would always be the busiest person out of all my friends... no one could relate to what I was doing. When I'm in L.A., I constantly feel like I'm keeping up with people, and I love that.","I can go to my premiere at the Chinese Theatre, and everyone will know me, and everyone will cater to me. And then I'll go to an audition and get rejected left, right and centre. They don't watch my videos, and they don't really know who I am. It is like starting from scratch when it comes to traditional Hollywood.","I'm by no means an expert at giving advice on depression, but I would say that a lot of my show is about making the decision to be happy. We all think that happiness is something that just falls into our lap. But it's something you have to really work on.","I will forever and always identify with Scarborough - no matter where I move."],"Lilly Wachowski":["After Bound, we were offered a lot of lesbian thrillers.","We thought we'd write a good script for women, giving them the fun roles that generally men get.","We've always loved going to the movies. Our mom and dad are big movie fans. They'd take us on these movie orgys where we'd see sometimes three movies in a day.","There's something uniquely interesting about Buddhism and mathematics, particularly about quantum physics, and where they meet. That has fascinated us for a long time.","The way a film can change over the generations... You watch a movie when you're 20 years old, and you see the same movie when you're 35 years old or 40 years old, and something happens. The movie changes because we change as individuals.","Part of being a filmmaker is also being a craftsman.","'Cloud Atlas' is for everybody. The main character in the movie is humanity."],"Lily Aldridge":["I love every second of being a mom.","I'm a woman, of course I still have curves on me, and that's ok. I had a baby and I've worked hard. And I don't think women should have to feel that kind of pressure. I've done it really healthfully, and I took my time.","It's important to still look like yourself on your wedding day, so I didn't do anything drastic.","I think I'm going to give my baby her first food on Thanksgiving, make her some organic sweet potato. I'm very excited! It's going to be a big day and my husband is in charge of the turkey - he's the chef of the family!","I'm eating a lot of organic proteins and vegetables! Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet is my No. 1 priority because I'm nursing my daughter.","I think it's really important to mix cardio with toning, so I love boxing and then add in Pilates or ballet to keep me long and lean and avoid bulking up.","But I want to start a family one day, and be involved in more charities, helping children.","The first Victoria's Secret model I ever met was Adriana Lima, and she was so nice to me. She was very generous and very nurturing. She made sure people talked to me!","I love doing Pilates and dance. It's fun to mix things up and change your program every ten days.","I work every day. I was flying the other day. and I was like, where am I flying? I have no idea, I work so much.","I always take working out seriously, but before a shoot I do extra sit ups and squats. I also eat more vegetables and drink a ton of water, because it really helps my skin glow."],"Lily Allen":["I don't really see how any song can not feel contrived if it isn't honest, and how could I write honest songs if I don't write about stuff going on in my life and how I'm feeling?","I'm opinionated, but I'm not a vindictive person and I never say anything unprovoked, either.","Because of piracy there has been a massive downturn in people buying music, which makes it more difficult for artists to make money from the sale of records.","You have to be in love with yourself before anyone else can fall in love with you; to be happy with yourself.","But Dad and I are the only father-and-daughter acts who have both had No. 1 songs in England.","I wasn't into anything at school. I used to get really embarrassed. I used to get asked to do performing things, and I'd go to all the rehearsals, and then I'd pretend to be ill on the day I had to actually perform. I was very unhappy at school.","I don't care what people think of me now, so why would I care when I'm dead?","I don't see myself as a role model; people should look to mothers and sisters as role models.","I studied voice when I was at school, and I was in the chamber choir, and I studied music theory as well, so I guess a lot of it came from being taught at school.","I'm just not a private person. It's not like I do things because I want things to be public; it's just that's my way of expressing myself, and I happen to be very famous.","I just felt like I couldn't deal with the everyday responsibilities of life, paying bills and all of that. I'm terrible at all of that. So I knew I had to make enough money to pay someone else to deal with all of that.","I refuse to put make-up on just because the paparazzi are on my doorstep. I find it morally wrong.","I never go out to be photographed, never. I go to events because they're fun.","Sometimes I wish I was just a girl in an indie band. I could dance around on stage and it wouldn't be so much about me.","I think as long as you're not being malicious and you're not hurting people then you should not be ashamed of what you do.","When a music teacher that I had at school was taken ill and we had a variety show and I had to fill in - that's when I realized I had a voice.","I think of myself as quite a confused kind of person, because I think there's so many great things about the world, but there are so many awful things too. I feel very guilty a lot of the time about enjoying my life so much when there are people living in such misery.","I've always listened to music, since I was really, really young.","Yeah, I was a florist. I went to floristry school.","I think I'm like Marmite; you either love me or you hate me.","I think the whole, like, cultural diversity and the arty side of London is really, really great. And how it's so historic as well.","I like to be able to get up and go and buy a pint of milk without bumping into 20 people I know.","I love MySpace; it's done an amazing job for me and it's been insane over the past couple of weeks, but I'm not a poster girl for them.","I hang out with models, the biggest pop stars and, you know, really and honestly, I hate saying this, but none of them are achieving those body shapes by being healthy."],"Lily Alridge":["Perfume always makes me feel put together after a long day of travelling. And I need my phone charger and a great moisturiser with SPF in my bag. A great pair of sneakers, a great face mask, and drinking a lot of water - those are my essentials for staying hydrated and refreshed.","Keep it simple. I usually have my hair up in a ballet bun and a great pair of sunglasses for when I'm on the go. On vacation, all you need is a sexy dress and great perfume, paired with a gorgeous red lip.","I'm hopeful for a world with more love, acceptance, and compassion for others.","Luckily, one of the perks of being an Angel is that I don't have to go to casting. It's so nerve-wracking - even the girls who have been in the show year after year still get nervous. The show is seen around the world, so it's a huge honor to be selected.","Anything to do with children, sign me up! I work a lot with St. Jude's Children's Hospital, which is an incredible hospital in Memphis that treats children with cancer for no charge whatsoever, including the families' lodging and all of their bills.","Working with photographer Mario Testino on Bulgari's 2017 global campaign in Italy was an incredible moment for me. I could see the Vatican from set! I got to play this powerful character during the shoot, and it was such an honor to represent that. My favorite pieces are from the Serpenti collection. It's distinctly Bulgari - very sexy!","The relationship between the models and the musical performers is very important.","I've grown up with a lot of my family in the fashion industry, so I've wanted to be part of it for as long as I can remember.","I amp up my workout by doing Ballet Beautiful twice a day.","I like a pretty, undone look. So I wash my hair every other day so it doesn't get dried out, and I let it air-dry. If I want soft waves, I'll braid it first.","Undereye patches are genius. From traveling, I get really puffy under my eyes. Klorane Smoothing and Relaxing Patches are a great ten-minute trick to look refreshed. They're perfect for moms running on no sleep.","When I was a kid, I got a bob because all of the other girls on my soccer team with straight hair had one, and so I wanted one. Now I know girls with thick, curly hair should not get bobs. My hair was like one big circle.","I love making a body scrub with ground-up coffee and coconut oil. It's really good for circulation, and it smells delicious. I also do a DIY Greek-yogurt-and-honey mask that softens your skin and helps reduce puffy eyes.","I always thought I was going to be a soccer player, get a scholarship to college, and then join the U.S. women's team.","I'm an ambassador for World of Children and St Jude's, it always been very important for me to use modeling as a platform to give back or raise awareness for causes that are important.","To me, Wonderlust is all about living life with a sense of adventure. I'm so honoured; I love being a Michael Kors woman.","If I don't have to work, I exercise every morning. It really clears my mind.","Social media is something I approach organically. It's all me! Sometimes I'll post four things in a few hours, but then I could go dark for a week.","When my daughter Dixie gets out of school, I take her to ballet, soccer, or karate. Or if it's a free afternoon, we might bake together. I love our time together. There is nothing more important in my life than making her happy.","Tracey Cunningham is my colorist, and she is genius! We match my color from when I was a kid.","I love great tea and my meals from Sakara Life!","I do sheet mask every day! They are so great when you are at home. My daughter thinks they are hilarious.","I don't really put on makeup when I'm on mom duty at home.","I'm so grateful for St. Jude. It's warm and welcoming and magical, and kids can be kids.","The most important thing in the world is children. St. Jude is literally saving people's lives. It's incredible."],"Lily Cole":["I don't think of myself as a role model for others, but I like to live my life by my own integrity. So, in that sense, I might be a positive influence. I do believe you should get over your insecurities and just try to be the best you can.","I was like most teenagers. I wanted to look more conventional - you know, to just be the pretty girl in school.","If I'm anywhere close to where I can hike or swim, that's my favourite thing to do.","The narrative of so many fairy tales are timeless in so many different cultures, and they have been since the dawn of man. They represent escapism, but they all feature themes that have such poignancy in a modern world.","It's hard to appreciate the importance of the rainforest because it seems so far away, but it's vital to the survival of the planet as we know it.","Life is shining a light through a magnifying glass on me, looking for me to stumble. I think that's my biggest fear.","I was of the type who gets bullied rather than the one who does the bullying, which I'm glad about. I'd rather be that than a bully.","I kind of see clothes a bit like role-playing, depending what mood I'm in.","There are so many great, great vintage clothes to find; there's a whole territory unexplored there.","Talent is crucial. It needs to be driven by motivation, but blind ambition isn't the key.","Modelling, fashion and film have all encouraged me to learn more about issues and to feel empowered enough to do something about them.","I'm not sure if it's fair to call it a 'fairy tale,' but I really loved 'Mulan,' the Disney film. It was my favorite. I guess it's not really a fairy tale, but you do get Eddie Murphy as a dragon.","The relationship between art and a job is not quite linear, but I really love any and all manifestations of art, really respect any kind of artistic impulse, whether it's paintings and sculptures or really good filmmaking or music. I really see the relationships between these different mediums as very fluid.","I think a lot of the most interesting work in art and in films are often kind of polarized opinions and affect people in very different ways, which may be less successful commercially, but they elicit a dialogue that's quite interesting.","As the generalization goes about the art industry, people can be really challenging and thought-provoking in their thinking and questioning the status quo, and it's really important that the status quo can be questioned and that there are people doing that.","It's not that I don't believe in creativity and innovation and new ideas, and the creativity that comes with fashion, which I really respect. But one of my biggest concerns is just how cheap we expect everything to be.","I'm not against people buying clothes; I think clothes are wonderful, and I'm very materialistic myself - but there's a way of finding a compromise. I just think we can buy less and pay more, to make sure people aren't being exploited.","I think models have a lot less power than they did in the '80s, when there were, like, only 10 supermodels who could dictate the rules, whereas now there's so many, and that changes the power dynamic and makes it a more insecure business.","It doesn't make me very happy to be on my computer all the time. I've never been drawn to that world.","Marilyn Monroe and Vivienne Leigh are real icons of mine. In terms of visual culture, they are both so iconic. There weren't any paparazzi shots of them falling out of taxis, so they will always look so incredible.","I started modeling at 14. It's simple. You respond to what the photographer wants and wear other people's ideas. I got bored with it, though, so I went to university.","In British culture, redheads get teased at school. But I've grown up enough to realize I love my hair.","It was a scandal when I did French 'Playboy' in 2008, though I was never actually nude in it. I think it's really funny that I'll have a cover of 'Playboy' to show my grandkids.","I don't personally follow trends; I don't even like the idea of trends. I think it's kind of absurd that you have to change every six months, so I always try and buy things that hopefully I'll like forever, and resonate with me.","I usually have a lip balm in my bag and mascara as well. I don't really wear much make-up, but I like mascara because I've got fair colouring.","There's an inherent contradiction between appreciating the beauty of clothes and creativity and individuality, and the waste around the ideas of trends and seasons.","I love beautiful things; I like having nice clothes, and I can appreciate why other people do - but I've also started to learn more about the impact of what we buy: how things are made, how much you buy and the quality of everything.","Acting is something I've done since I was six years old, performing for my mum and my family in the living room, and I do it because my heart's in it.","I'll always try to follow my heart into things I love, and modelling is not something I'm dreaming of pursuing forever.","I have made a living off the way I look, and I have really learnt to accept myself for being unusual.","America has had an influence on me, as has going out with a Cuban-American guy and having lots of American friends. But I am still fundamentally British and speak with a British accent and feel very English.","I always used to love couture because it was more theatrical than the runways. The runways always felt more like part of the machine.","There is a degree of role-playing in modeling, for sure, and you're also in a high-profile job - there are lots of similarities for sure. But when I'm acting, I've got to try and be present, and I've got to be emotionally committed to a character, both physically and intellectually.","I've always gone after fears and tried to stifle them by doing them. It is daunting, but it's more rewarding.","I found going to school when I was modeling very grounding. It's really kept my perspective on bigger things in my life.","I love yoga. I don't do it as much as I'd like to, but I feel wonderful when I do.","I don't believe there's an afterlife - but I don't believe there's an end to life. Consciousness goes beyond the bounds of your body.","The need to protect the environment has emerged as an undeniably important priority for me.","I part-own a bookshop for some strange coincidence of reasons, and it is one of the best things I part-own in my life, or own in my life. I do not know, it just feels great.","I've always cared about issues, always thought through problems. I don't know how much that comes from my personality or my mum.","Production chains, how consumers can drive change: all these things may seem at odds with fashion, but arguably, they're not.","When I was younger, I definitely did face anti-ginger prejudice. As a child, all teasing hurts, whether it's because you're fat or a different race or have red hair. I had enough comments from a couple of people to make it a sore point.","With acting, if I'm any good at it, my modeling career would never be a hindrance but would rather be a help. And if I'm not, then it doesn't really matter.","I'm just a lipgloss, blush and mascara kind of girl. I like playing with a bright lipstick or a heavy eye... But not together!","Every time I have to try on a wig for work, I get excited about the colour; I've often thought about going for a platinum bob or also raven black, as it looks so great against pale skin. But I always end up being loyal to my red colour.","Don't overpluck your eyebrows. A make-up artist told me this once, and I've always remembered it.","The average Londoner knows just one neighbour. I travel a lot, and I'm always surprised by the strong sense of community in some countries. We've lost something fundamentally human, and we don't even realise it.","Giving triggers social cohesion. It's also the basis for an economy not based on money.","I think the media are so hypocritical a lot of the time in the way they chastise something just so that they can print it again.","I paint - I tend more to abstraction - but not as much as I would like to because of time. I would love to do sculpture - I've toyed with the idea of fitting in a sculpture course.","People do make assumptions about models. That's their issue, not mine. It doesn't bother me because I'm comfortable enough in my own skin - I know who I am.","I love modeling but also see it as a platform for the million other things I want to achieve and create in life."],"Lily Collins":["Social media has allowed me to communicate with girls all over the world. It's always been really important to me that they know I experience the same things that they do and face the same insecurities.","My advice for girls who are waiting for their Prince Charming is to be open for anything. Be open to new experiences, be open to the idea that it may take longer than you want, but if you're open to meeting new people and new adventures, then love will come along.","Never once does 'Snow White' herself look in the mirror so she isn't aware of her beauty or what apparently that does to people. It's really just the queen and the prince that talk about it.","There's so many stories to tell in Hollywood in the Golden Age that stems from truth.","As a little girl living in the English countryside, I used to go running around in the forests, creating my own fairy tale.","Everything for me has happened so quickly. I finished shooting 'The Blind Side' not this past June, but the June before, and all of sudden up to now, it seems like it's gone from zero to 60 for me. I feel so fortunate to be able to say that.","To be able to say, 'I'm going to be Snow White' - it's crazy. It's an honor.","A lot of people in my generation have dared to ask questions like, 'Who is James Dean?' And I can't imagine asking a question like that, just because it's been ingrained in me since I was so young.","Morning or night, I love putting mint or spearmint oil on my temples and the back of my neck. There's this aromatherapy quality of both easing tension and waking you up.","I'm just fascinated by visiting actual castles in the countryside.","I'm trying to be the most vibrant version of myself.","There's no California tan about me. People assume I can't tan, but I actually can. I went on a trip to Hawaii when I was younger and came back so tan that people were like, 'What happened?' It's just not something I actively do. I want to embrace my ivory.","It's really important to stand up for yourself and not always agree with what people say if indeed you don't feel that that's true.","I really think everything happens for a reason.","As a fan of reading - I've always loved reading - I just love reading books that take me away for a little while and let me disappear. And that's why I loved 'Harry Potter' growing up.","Not many people know my father was an actor. He was the Artful Dodger in 'Oliver!,' and was in a film called 'Frauds,' too. It's interesting talking to him about acting, how much you can get turned down, and how not to take that as a discouragement. It's nice to have that element to relate to for us both.","I'm passionate about speaking out against bullying and speaking up for self-awareness with young people and body-image issues and self-esteem issues.","There's this common perception that having a famous last name is all you need. A surname may get you a meeting, but if there's no talent you won't get the part.","The journalist in me always loved relating and socialising and connecting with people, but there came a point where I needed to make a decision to stop that being my focus and really focus on acting - an audience are only really going to believe me as a character to an extent if they don't know me as Lily that well.","I couldn't handle the pain and confusion surrounding my dad's divorce, and I was having a hard time balancing being a teenager with pursuing two different grown-up careers.","I have amazing memories of being able to travel and being able to have family all over the world.","I'm in a relationship with myself. I think a lot of young girls should do that.","I was actually the one who decided to move to LA. Mom and I were driving on Sunset Boulevard during one of our trips back to see her family, and I said, 'Can we just stay?' So we did.","I would love to do a British period drama.","I love Helena Bonham Carter because every character that she portrays, she's just something completely different. And she has that quirky factor that she just owns.","I loved Jennifer Lawrence's performance in 'Winter's Bone.'","I had some difficult times when I first moved to Los Angeles when people would tell me I was saying things wrong. I felt different although my mum kept reminding me it was OK to be different.","I grew up being obsessed with old Hollywood and loving the history, what's behind the scenes, and what people don't know.","I sing some songs but don't expect me to release an album anytime soon.","My older siblings and I all work in 'the industry'. So obviously we have hectic schedules, but we make it work.","No, I like to wear as least amount of makeup as I can during my everyday life because I'm just all about keeping my skin healthy and hydrated and I love to laugh and have a great time and smile - that's when I feel the most pretty so I just want to make sure that I stay happy.","My parents read me fairy tales every night and I used to believe I was a fairytale princess, like every young girl. I had all the Disney dressing-up costumes and would play every character.","Growing up in the English countryside, I feel like I'm in a Jane Austen novel when I walk around. I just feel comfortable and confident in those surroundings.","Art is an amazing form of being able to share our experiences and tell stories and hopefully relate to other people, but you don't know how everyone else is always going to react to what you put out there.","From a young age, I've had a desire to put forward this perfect image, whatever perfect was.","As an actor, you gain weight, you lose weight, you change your hair color, and you make changes physically and emotionally to be able to understand the character.","I love to write down things I notice about people or things I've overheard people saying that are interesting. I love people-watching, and I love taking the time to notice the small things.","I don't want to acquire whatever 'fame' is.","My mom is such a strong, independent, strong-willed woman, and she always taught me to accept my worth for how I viewed myself and female empowerment, and it's okay to be independent and also need someone at the same time. I kinda get to be both.","I think it's just important to not judge people based on their physicality because it's really about personality and people's hearts and souls. That's what drew me to Audrey Hepburn who is kind of like my icon.","My last name may have opened doors, but I have to keep them open.","A lot of my friends aren't working, especially since fewer films are being made now and there's more competition.","I was raised by my mom, pretty much, and she just had this very non-judgmental, having no shame about yourself, no regrets, just trusting your gut and your instinct, and treating yourself with respect.","But the thing is, I was never looking at a strategic way of gaining fame. That's not why I'm doing this.","I've only ever known growing up across different countries - to me it's just fun.","At a party recently I was introduced to Meryl Streep, and it took me a second to get my head around it. You know, that I'm meeting these people now. I'm doing it.","I've grown up knowing that you put as much of your private life out there as you feel comfortable with.","My dad knows how to tell a story. He'd make me laugh by doing all the different voices.","To play someone I loved in my favourite fairytale as a kid is a total honour.","At first, I didn't hang out with celebrity kids. That wasn't the way I was brought up. I went to a run-of-the-mill Catholic primary school when we first moved to L.A. But then I went to a high school where there were lots of 'industry' children. Those weren't my best friends and I've never set out to make myself a part of that scene.","I think I've been brought up very well by both my parents. I am very cautious and I think I'm now fit for the world I'm in. They're very much behind my modelling and very supportive.","I don't know if this is too weird to say, but this is completely surreal for me. Bizarre. The cover of 'Teen Vogue' has been on my bucket list forever.","I'm drawn to roles that have real substance, that aren't just the victim or the teenage girl or the girlfriend.","My mother used to take me to flea markets in my stroller, and I would just rummage through the piles. You've got to dig through the overstuffed racks that everyone else just walks by. It's the only way to find the cool stuff.","I grew up understanding the pros and cons of what you're getting into and knowing what comes with your job. I like to keep my private life private, and then work is work. I feel so far I've had a really good balance with that.","I don't like reading things that people say on the Internet because I know so much of it is not true. I don't want to waste my time worrying about what other people are thinking. I just want to focus on being able to do cool projects.","When it comes to the work, I'm excited to see what people think. When it comes to the private life, that's when I don't pay attention.","It used to bother me - having bigger, fuller brows. I even plucked them once so I'd fit in, but I hated them and couldn't wait for them to grow back. Now I embrace them. I realized the quirky things that make you different are what make you beautiful.","I've grown up seeing the pros and cons but I love it and I've always wanted to act. Throughout all the rejections at auditions, and especially when I finally did get something, both my parents have been so supportive and always told me it is all about passion and, if I was doing it because I love it, there's no wrong choice.","I've always loved Jane Austen's writing.","I'm a fashion gal through and through.","Makeup, in general, is amazing.","There's so many different things that you can physically change for a character.","Many of my deepest insecurities stem from my issues with my dad.","Entertainment is a great form of being able to tell a story and to spread a message.","When I went through my eating disorder, I never sought medical assistance. I created myths in my head about how I should get through things, so the idea that I could surround myself with truth and feel comfortable enough to speak mine allowed me to breathe.","I'd love to dive into a comedy.","I think we all want to fit in at a young age.","You always hope someone will take you under their wing and teach you - when it's Warren Beatty, it's like, 'Oh my God, how is this real?'","I've always been a firm believer that you don't have to close one door in order to open another.","Even in L.A., where everyone's in yoga pants, I've never been the girl to run around in sweats.","I love fashion and always have something put together, but I won't wear anything specifically to be photographed in. I have become more cautious of making funny faces in public.","I'm a huge fan of the series of books by Cassandra Clare, 'The Mortal Instruments.'","I really, really love Lucy Hale.","I was very lucky that my first film, 'The Blind Side,' I worked with Sandra Bullock.","I'm very British at heart. When I come to England, I say I'm coming home, and then it's funny: when I leave England to go back to L.A., I also say I'm going back home.","I've always been a huge admirer and lover of Alexander McQueen, Alexander Wang. I love so many British designers like Stella McCartney.","I love mixing in high street stuff and vintage.","I rarely, rarely - unless it's a big red carpet - wear all one designer.","Every movie that I'm in is very different in terms of aesthetic and costume. I mean, from 'Mirror, Mirror' to 'Mortal Instruments,' I went from dressy dresses to leather and heels and tight, sexy, chic outfits.","I don't choose projects according to the idea of being a role model. To be considered as one is definitely an honor.","There is a Twitter account apparently dedicated to my brows. I do not Tweet on it, but... they talk about who they've seen today.","Every day, there is a person following me, taking pictures. It's bizarre because I'm just going to the gym or getting a smoothie. I don't have the time or energy to be constantly put together all the time, but that's real life.","Don't let the American twang fool you. I still say, 'I'm going home,' when I come to England, and I love a good old cup of PG Tips with a Jaffa Cake.","My mum always removed her make-up at night and taught me early on about the importance of taking care of your skin, especially when you're travelling or extremely busy, because it's so easily affected by your surroundings and health.","I've always loved writing.","So much has changed since the '70s and '80s when it comes to acting and being in the public eye. We'd go out to a restaurant, and there would be five or six people. Now there's a lot more, plus social media, and this desire to bring other people down.","I've had to prove myself. But I'm driven, and I would love to make my own mark on the world.","I like acting impulsively, but I'm also extremely thoughtful about what I do. So, it's not like someone would say 'Don't do something,' and I'd automatically go, 'I'm gonna do it anyway.'","I've never acted fully impulsively. I think with my mind and my heart.","I sang for 'Mirror Mirror.' I love singing.","I graduated high school, and I always wanted to go to college, but I also really wanted to work at a young age. At 18, I was pitching talk show ideas to different networks. I was a journalist.","The less you have on your face, the less there is to go wrong.","I've grown up being obsessed by 'Harry Potter.'","I've always loved fashion design. I love drawing and creating looks and styling.","I grew up knowing the pros and cons of the business and knowing what comes with pursuing what you love in terms of being in the public eye. I also grew up among people that were considered celebrities and people that people admired.","I remember the screen test for 'Gossip Girl' was on the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank. I was about 17 or 18 years old at the time. I remember driving onto the lot and going, 'Oh my God. This is surreal.'","I've always been weirdly interested in food documentaries.","I feel like what Director Bong is so amazing at is taking so many things and presenting them to you - never telling you how to think, but, if you leave the theater thinking something, we've done our jobs right.","I just want to start conversations. I want to do films that prompt conversations - whether that is positive, negative, indifferent - just ones that you leave the theater wanting to know more, wanting to watch the film over and over again.","I'm constantly surprised by human nature and humanity. And I think that's why I love what I do: because I love to story-tell and bring new characters to life.","I think, in life, we want to surround ourselves with people who make us think and question ourselves, and those are the types of films I want to do and the types of characters that I hope I get to continue to play.","I went to a high school, I took tests, I took finals, I went to football games - I did the whole thing. Because I really wanted to have that normalcy.","I believe in the producers at Constantin, and I know that they have a really good taste level when it comes to the creative side.","I get kids who say, 'Oh, I love your movie, but my mum loves your dad.' It's really nice to be able to share that with him, but it doesn't define who I am career-wise.","I think it's important to figure out you and to have fun and to be dating and to figure out what you like and what you don't like. It's what growing up is all about.","I find that I'm really attracted to mysterious creatives, and I love people that are able to put their emotions out there for not just the world to see, but just that are giving of their emotions, but a little bit mysterious and elusive as well.","Because my dad was often gone, I never wanted to do anything that would make him stay away even longer. I became extra careful about what I said and how I said it, afraid he'd think I was angry or didn't love him. And the truth is, I was angry. I missed him and wanted him there.","I love getting oxygen facials because I travel a lot. My skin gets pretty dry with all the airplanes.","I love the royal family. I even got up in the middle of the night to watch Kate and William's wedding. And I never miss the Queen's speech on Christmas Day. I feel it's my duty as an English-born woman to watch.","I've always loved big eyes, like those of Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor. But my mother didn't allow me to wear make-up until I was 15.","I remember the first scene I shot on 'The Blind Side.' I was with Sandra Bullock, and I kept trying to stop myself thinking, 'Oh my God, I can't believe I'm in a movie with her.'","I love Charlotte Olympia and Sophia Webster shoes best - they're like art for the feet.","Hollywood in the 1930s is an incredible period of history. There are so many amazing stories about the stars and the studios at that time that you can't fit into one film.","I didn't want to have people open doors for me. My dad never made a call on my behalf to anyone - not to a producer, a director, or a casting agent.","I didn't want to land an audition because I was 'The daughter of...' I never wanted to give anyone the opportunity to say, 'You only got the role because of who you are.'","I remember lying in bed one night when I was 15 and deciding I was ready to go into acting properly. I'd put it off until then because I didn't feel I was ready to handle the rejections.","I'm such a believer in going to set, even when you're not working, because I think the best things to be learned, you don't necessarily get from your own scene or from someone speaking to you and telling you advice. I think it's all about watching and just taking it all in. It's not even when the cameras are rolling, necessarily.","It's great when improv is encouraged. It's a really fun thing. It depends on who's in the movie and how their process works as well. It takes a director who is open to that because you have a script, but then something funny could happen on set.","I did a show when I was two, but I didn't start acting as a child. I wanted to go to school every day and be with my friends and really have that experience.","Regarding scripts and projects, I've always been open to reading all sorts of genres and never closing myself off to one, because you never know what you might find.","I want to produce and direct and write one day.","During the day, I'm constantly reapplying hand cream. My grandma used to do it all the time, so maybe I got it from her.","I've always loved being active, and I used to do sports - basketball, soccer, volleyball - growing up.","It's a weird thing to have your dad or your parent be on the stage with a million people saying their name, and you're like, 'No, that's just dad.'","I've always loved fantasy books. Even just growing up, I've always kind of loved magic and fantasy.","My mom brought me up on old Hollywood. I had been living in Los Angeles, respecting old movies and growing up with people that were icons that I got to speak to.","When you surprise yourself and you can't remember what the take felt like, then something transformative has happened.","Cate Blanchett. Judi Dench. Helen Mirren. Everything about them. Even their fashion choices. They're so with it and cool and women I admire. They take chances. They're chameleons. Everything that they do. They're also amazing mothers.","When you trust and have elevated personnel in each department, then the sky really is the limit. If you don't have that trust in the backbone of the project, you may not know what you're making.","I always loved dressing up and telling stories.","I've been so fortunate to work with so many successful women who are moms as well.","Hollywood is such a fickle place, and you really have to go day to day and with the flow. Things happen so quickly, for the good or the bad. But you also have to know that everything happens for a reason."],"Lily Donaldson":["I've worn jeans until they're ripped all the way around the crotch and I can't wear them any longer. You get so attached to jeans, they're like old friends.","My favourite trainers are Converse.","One favourite find of mine has to be a 1980s black dinner jacket that I wear as a dress.","I like doing Pilates because I get to lie down on the floor for the duration of the session.","I don't wear lipstick when I'm not at work.","Growing up I always used to shop in Oxfam. I'd find things for 50p and then take them home, cut them up and make them into something new.","I wear a lot of different jewellery. I love to look for it when I'm abroad or if I find a great antique or vintage shop.","I would love to be a sleeper, but I'm not. I'm usually up pretty early, even if I've been out the night before.","If all else fails and you don't know what to wear, put on a black dress, and you'll be happy.","I wear a lot of different jewelry. I love to look for it when I'm abroad or if I find a great antique or vintage shop."],"Lily James":["There's nothing wrong with falling in love and sharing your life with someone.","As cynical as I can be, there's always a part of me that believes in love and the fairy tale.","In regards to your love life, you're just entering into a whole of pain if you talk about it. If you've never said anything, there are no sound bites to haunt you when you're crying into a box of Kleenex after it all goes wrong.","In anything, I always give my all. I'm not a good loser.","Ultimately, 'Cinderella' is the story of the underdog. You root for her in this fairytale; the girl who has nothing, deserves so much more, and gets it.","I think I feel most like a princess when I'm sort of bursting with happiness and love, so whether that would be, like, with my boyfriend or my family or at a really fun party - just when you're full of life.","I love to start the morning with a mist spray, especially after a night out.","The world of the flapper - live free, wild and young - that energy is intoxicating. It's nice to inject that into the more controlled 'Downton' way of living.","You know that scene in 'Runaway Bride' when Julia Roberts puts on the amazing wedding dress and looks at herself in the mirror and goes, 'Swish, swish'? I loved that moment so much when I was a little girl.","My mom passed down to me her old Levi's denim jacket. When I left it on a plane, I was devastated. I've never been able to find anything with quite the same cool, faded look.","I think it's so important to be healthy and confident and natural. And not put too much stress on trying to be thin - I don't get the thin, thin thing at all.","I think everyone can feel like an outsider. I know I have. I've always felt like one.","When people feel good, they look good.","I saw this cool interview with Amy Adams from when she did 'Enchanted' and played a princess, and when kids came up to her with no make-up and ripped jeans on, she said, 'I'm off duty. I'm an off-duty princess', and I thought that was quite sweet.","Boarding school in Tring was a bit of a bubble that burst when I went to Hackney to go to drama school.","I treated myself to a £700 Chloe bag after one of my first acting jobs. Then my friends pointed out that, for the same money, I could buy a flight to India. So I took it back.","I think our sense as actors of what we've just done - whether or not it be in an audition - is usually really not connected to any truth. I'm always asking for more takes and more goes. I think I just need to shut up and listen.","I have an amazing stylist; she's called Rebecca Corbin Murray... I go around to her living room, and it's sort of exploding with dresses, and we go through them all, and she's so good at picking things she knows I'll like, and we work together. She's taught me absolutely everything; she's brilliant.","I want to be Ursula in 'The Little Mermaid.'","My dad lived on Sunset Boulevard for a couple of years as a waiter, and he said he'd do a different character every time somebody sat down, just to get some practice.","For exams, I swotted so hard because I couldn't bear the thought of not coming first.","I think it's probably best to work out in the morning to get it out of the way. My ultimate top tip is to drag yourself, even if you have to roll yourself out of your bed and in to a sit-up - it's really not that bad once you start.","I loved all the princess films, and I grew up with them, and I think it's really cool how they've changed over the years - how the princesses have become more positive role models right up until 'Frozen.'","I really have been lucky because I've always had a very healthy attitude to my body.","I don't like seeing celebs looking too skinny, I love it when they look healthy and comfortable in their bodies and embrace their curves.","I love clothes but it's a struggle for me to get out of jeans and a baggy jumper.","Mum would have a panic attack if she had to stand up and give a speech around a table.","I really want to play interesting roles, but you want to work, so it's a balancing game.","I used to go to musicals every birthday - that was my birthday present. We'd go to London, me and my two brothers and mum and dad. I think I saw 'Mamma Mia' about five times.","The first Disney movie I saw I think was 'Snow White.' I loved all the Disney princess movies.","My first paid role was my first job out of drama school, which was 'Just William.' It was a BBC TV show. I played Ethel.","I played Nina in 'The Seagull,' and I remember thinking it's incredible to see all the actresses in the past that've played her. It's quite strengthening. You feel a part of the family of actresses going through and giving something of themselves to the role.","It's so hard coming out of drama school to claim your right to be taken seriously and even get auditions.","It took me a while to warm to the '20s costumes on 'Downton.' I love it when women accentuate their curves, and that era was all about hiding them. The shapes they wore then were in tune with female empowerment. Cutting off their hair and hiding their busts was a way of saying, 'We're equal to men!'","Growing up, I was always prancing around and singing... and I just never really stopped.","I want to do more theater, which allows you to take bigger risks and experiment.","When I worked with Bill Nighy on 'Wrath of the Titans,' he said to me, 'There's one thing you can promise me, and that's never, ever, ever read your reviews.'","You are what you're portrayed as.","At drama school, we were taught to write down your dreams and carry them around in your wallet with you, and they'll come true, but I didn't do that.","The Twenties outfits are all about freedom and loose, flowing lines, whereas in 'Cinderella,' I had to wear corsets and big huge skirts.","I don't have an exact moment when I decided I wanted to be an actress - it kind of was just really a part of my growing up.","I don't do anything with my brows.","I love putting on a red lip. I don't do it so much for events - somehow, I don't seem to get it right - but when I just go to the pub or to a restaurant or something, I just put a red lip on.","People talk a lot about, 'You're a Disney princess! You're Cinderella!' and this and that. But for me, it's all about the fact that I worked with Cate Blanchett and was directed by Kenneth Branagh. That's the 'Cinderella' story for me.","I'm a healthy girl.","I loved fairy tales growing up.","I never thought I would say this, but I'm desperate to do an action film.","I naturally have a really small waist.","Diet Coke is the only way I get through filming because I get so tired.","I'm such a geek now with princesses. It's pathetic.","I love singing so much. As a kid, that was what I wanted to do.","The greatest thing is that usually the auditions you think are bad are the ones you get.","It's pretty disabling sometimes, the terror of not living up. My expectations are the worst.","My mum thinks I'm amazing at everything. That unconditional love is just the most precious thing you can have.","I live in dungarees, and I love denim - I wear denim shirts a lot.","I'm a real hoarder.","I think Keira Knightley is amazing, and I've heard also that she is one of the coolest, most down-to-earth, brilliant girls, and I really look up to her in that respect. She's got it all, really, and I think she's made interesting, bold choices in her work.","With corsets, it's interesting when you put them on, realizing that's what women actually wore. They're just so constricting.","There are other things I want to focus on rather than staying in shape.","I saw Cate Blanchett in 'Big and Small,' and it was mind-blowing. The fact that she can do theatre and is also a huge movie star is really exciting.","Sadly, I've never met Princess Kate.","To be honest, when I was growing up - I think it's because of Kate Winslet and 'Titanic' - I always wanted to do period.","Any kid in the world can draw from strengths within - we all have the potential with that.","I trained with Olympics Athlete Jeanette Kwakye - who is amazing! And Shani Anderson, who is an excellent Olympic runner. We trained five times a week; running, circuits, weights, working out in the gym, and on the track. It was an insane time.","I think Beyonce always looks great.","I find cardio hard.","Why do women always get pointed at for their bodies?","The famous pilot season literally sends shivers down my spine.","You have to pretend to be cool, which I never am.","I admire actresses like Jennifer Lawrence, who says what she thinks.","When the board games came out of the cupboard when I was a kid, I had to beat my two brothers every time.","Top athletes are like warriors.","God, I used to have really skinny-crap eyebrows. They were such an ugly disaster.","It's hard to see yourself as a princess because it involves a huge leap of the imagination and sort of requires you to believe you can be that, which is a scary, weird thing.","I'm dying to do a tiny indie and play something totally naturalistic without any sort of constraints on me. Something where I can shock everyone.","As an actor, you get a bit itchy to do something entirely different.","I'm learning a lot about how to be one of the 'good' actors. You'd hope that it's natural to be a good person, and kind, but I'm learning how to deal with long, sometimes boring days.","I feel like, sometimes, characters that are just good and nice can seem boring or uninteresting.","For girls growing up, sometimes I think they get the wrong idea for what women should look like.","Corsets are always hard to wear.","I remember meeting the princesses at Disney World and getting their autographs.","No one looks twice at me when they're around, and 'Cinderella' has made no difference. And I know that isn't going to change.","Drama school was a lifeline for me, it saved me. I found it very nurturing - I just clung on.","I thought it'd be interesting to play an off-centre character who doesn't have to be pretty.","It's weird when you get roles that coincide with your life.","'Cinderella' touches on loss, and there was definitely a strong sense of grief in my life.","I loved learning to fight and kill zombies.","I love London, but I love traveling, and I don't think I'll be here forever. Possibly, I'd like to move to New York and do a play in New York.","I Googled myself, and I saw some nice things and some not-so-nice things. I've learned that that stuff isn't real, and it doesn't exist unless you look at it.","My dad did every single accent under the sun, and he would read bedtime stories.","It's weird, the idea of someone else playing my dad, but weirdly nice."],"Lily King":["I'm very interested in the way people interact emotionally.","I have three stepfamilies as well as my family of origin. I've had to adjust to them and also go back and forth among them. I became an observer of human nature because when you are in those situations you have to be.","I've always thought of writing as sort of active communication."],"Lily Koppel":["I'm still very interested in telling one-of-a-kind women's stories.","Apollo 11 was the movie premiere of moon landings, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Neil was a bit of a mystic, but also a taciturn guy from what I can tell. He really saw the moon as looking like the American high desert. He wasn't someone who dealt in metaphors.","Americans are obsessed with wild, outlandish things. Marilyn Monroe, Mickey Mouse, and Michael Jackson are all wild, outlandish things.","We've all heard about space and landing on the moon, but somehow it's a very tom-boyish adventure. It's planting the flag on the moon by Neil Armstrong, and it has this very male-hero edge to it.","There is something so hopeful about a diary, a journal, a new notebook, which Joan Didion and Virginia Woolf both wrote about. A blog. Perhaps we all are waiting for someone to discover us.","In our era of celebrity, where every life is made public through email, blogs and Facebook, one of the greatest oddities may be that there is not a livelier discussion about the individual's basic need for a more private space."],"Lily Nicksay":["I sailed around Europe and lived with the Karen tribe in Thailand for a month.","I went to high school in the highlands of Scotland."],"Lily Rabe":["For a long time I was cautious of working with my parents because I wanted to feel separate from them in the community. Now there's no more wasting time.","All I really want to do is someday be in a western. If I could be on a horse with a rifle, I would be a really happy camper.","Truthfully, I don't know how those special effects people do it.","Before I ever start a job that I'm really excited about, I usually have some sleepless nights or weeks or months. But that anticipation for a person like me... I don't do so well with a lot of time off.","As someone who's been doing a lot of classical theater recently, I loved the idea of getting to run around in Steven Alan, and not be in a corset and a wig, and not have a dialect, and get to be in a 90-minute play with no intermission, and get to do real comedy.","No, I'm not feminist. I'm not, not a feminist.","When I was in high school and college, my other real focus was, actually, fiction writing. So in college, I had done all these seminars with these various writers-in-residence.","I did have wonderful things to draw from, from my own experience and also just from friends and people I'd gone to school with who were very much immersed in this world right now.","It's very hard when you're doing a new play that you believe in, and you want to tell the story in the best way possible.","I had never done a 90-minute play with no intermission, so it is a bit like you get onto the train and you don't get off until it's over - and it's over very quickly, so don't miss a moment of it. That experience is very rare and specific so don't miss a minute, because there aren't very many minutes of it.","The focus of our family life was homework and what was for dinner; getting to ballet rehearsal and getting my brother to soccer.","I will say that I've been lucky enough never to have to do a job I didn't want to do, or a play I wasn't in love with.","When I was teeny tiny, I definitely had a voice that didn't quite match the way I looked at five.","Listen, a cable series is a beautiful thing because there's such amazing writing happening on television, and it's a schedule that allows you to do a play or two. There's a reason everybody wants that job!","So, for the most part, I really like when I read a scene that scares me and makes me sweat a little bit, thinking about doing it. That's usually a good sign to me.","Mark Conseulos is so amazing.","I know it's such a boring interview sometimes with us at 'American Horror Story', but I just can't say a word. I would certainly love to be back, that's for sure. It's such a great job.","I think every script I read has something that sends me into a state of panic but that usually makes me want to do it.","I can't actually think of a job where I was relaxed the whole time. I don't think I would want to do that job. When I break into a cold sweat when I'm reading, I think, 'Oh good. That's what's supposed to be happening.'","The only thing that matters is the theater!","One of my mother's friends said to me, 'Your ex-boyfriends didn't stand a chance with you and your mother.' And I think I probably was unfair to them because she was the first person and the last person I called about every single thing. Sorry, ex-boyfriends.","To be working in the theater steadily and to be recognized and appreciated by the community means the world.","Being a part of the theater community has been important to me from the time I was a child, through my parents.","It's sort of scary to work with your parents when you're in the same business. But there was something so very safe about that. Acting with her was just like working with a wonderful actress who just happens to be my best friend and also my mother.","You want to feel like people are hiring you because they want to work with you, not because of who your parents are.","I am my parents' daughter, and I always want to be. But I first wanted to make sure that I was standing on my own two feet."],"Lily Tomlin":["I like a teacher who gives you something to take home to think about besides homework.","I always wanted to be somebody, but now I realize I should have been more specific.","The road to success is always under construction.","Reality is the leading cause of stress among those in touch with it.","I always wondered why somebody doesn't do something about that. Then I realized I was somebody.","The trouble with the rat race is that even if you win, you're still a rat.","No matter how cynical you become, it's never enough to keep up.","The best mind-altering drug is the truth.","If you read a lot of books you are considered well read. But if you watch a lot of TV, you're not considered well viewed.","What I appreciate is acknowledging to the audience that I think they have brains.","I grew up in a time when women didn't really do comedy. You had to be homely, overweight, an old maid, all that. You had to play a stereotype, because very attractive women were not supposed to be funny - because it's powerful; it's a threat.","Don't be afraid of missing opportunities. Behind every failure is an opportunity somebody wishes they had missed.","Instead of working for the survival of the fittest, we should be working for the survival of the wittiest - then we can all die laughing.","Sometimes I feel like a figment of my own imagination.","We are all in this together, by ourselves.","Why isn't there a special name for the tops of your feet?","If love is the answer, could you please rephrase the question?","There's so much plastic in this culture that vinyl leopard skin is becoming an endangered synthetic.","Why is it that when we talk to God we're said to be praying but when God talks to us we're schizophrenic?","Many times I sit back and say, 'I can't believe that this is my life!' Other times, I feel self-satisfied. I mean, there's a lot to be proud and thankful for but, nonetheless, it's just a life!","I've always wanted to be somebody, but I see now I should have been more specific.","Reality is nothing but a collective hunch.","What is reality, anyway? Just a collective hunch.","But there are too many people that make so much money at the cost of lives of other humans and for no reason but to make the money.","Remember we're all in this alone.","You don't really need to get married, but marriage is awfully nice. Everybody I know who got married, they say it really makes a difference. They feel very, very happy about it.","I personally think we developed language because of our deep need to complain.","Ninety eight percent of the adults in this country are decent, hardworking, honest Americans. It's the other lousy two percent that get all the publicity. But then, we elected them.","Sometimes I worry about being a success in a mediocre world.","Man invented language to satisfy his deep need to complain.","We don't care. We don't have to. We're the phone company.","I worry that the person who thought up Muzak may be thinking up something else.","Things are going to get a lot worse before they get worse.","If truth is beauty, how come no one has their hair done in the library?","We're all in this alone.","For fast-acting relief try slowing down.","It's my belief we developed language because of our deep inner need to complain.","If I had known what it would be like to have it all - I might have been willing to settle for less.","What if it's boring - or if it's not boring, it might be too revealing, or worse, it might be too revealing and still be boring.","If you read a lot of books, you're considered well-read. But if you watch a lot of TV, you're not considered well-viewed.","You know being relevant or coming up with something interesting, funny to say about what's current is just as hard as it might ever be depending on the serendipity of it all.","I mean yes to act out something or take chances in the performance is one thing. But in terms of a camera, whatever's captured is captured so that's a little more daunting.","I guess if people couldn't profit from war I don't think there would be war.","I especially love 'Web Therapy' and I did 'Eastbound and Down' too. I had a lot of fun doing that.","I was always drawn to more the social-expression-of-culture types.","Creating characters is just another way to express a type and put that type to use.","I guess that's one of the reasons that you do it - work all the time - because it's sort of a high to find something that really works.","When I was 9 or 10, I had a ten-cent business: I would walk your dog for a dime, go to the store for a dime, empty your garbage for a dime - and then I could use the money to buy tricks at the magic store.","I think my politics are just inclined to be empathetic and humanistic. I grew up with so many different kinds of people with different politics, different religion, no religion, no politics, education, no education, and I was infatuated with all of them.","I never officially came out in any kind of really public way. I just always lived very simply and openly, but the press has never made a big fuss about me or said anything to me."],"Lily-Rose Depp":["I'm a Gemini, very spontaneous.","I grew up with the media circus. My whole life. My parents were very calm about the photographers, the fans, and all that. But I understood right away that I hadn't done anything to deserve that attention. No matter what happens, it will be there. I didn't choose it. You just can't take that too seriously. You need to live your life. And stay calm.","I'm very specific about what I put out on social media about myself. But that's also why I like social media: because it feels like the only thing that I have to control my own image.","I never like revealing too much about myself. Once you start giving people that look into your life, then they just want more and more.","My parents were very calm about the photographers, the fans, and all that. But I understood right away that I hadn't done anything to deserve that attention. No matter what happens, it will be there. I didn't choose it. You just can't take that too seriously. You need to live your life. And stay calm.","Art is such a personal experience, I really try to make my own thing.","When I was a baby, I wore my mom's Chanel pumps - to be able to say that I work with Karl Lagerfeld is a dream come true.","I can act every single day because I love it; it's just so liberating. It might be rare, but there are certain moments when you really don't feel like yourself. When you are in the character so fully, it's the best feeling ever. I so love it. Even if those moments come just once a day or every other day, they are just worth it.","I would be much less stressed out without social media. I am constantly afraid of getting hacked. It's like being afraid of stepping on glass.","If you like something one day, then you do, and if you like something else the other day, it's whatever.","I wanted to be a singer, but once I started acting, I felt so comfortable. Now, all I want to do is act.","The only movies I want to do are the ones I'm passionate about. I care about school, and I'm still a kid. I want to live like that while I can.","It is delicate being my age and trying to do all the regular teenager stuff, and then having that in the spotlight.","I first started using social media when I was 12 or something - not publicly; I had private accounts.","I have a good time when I'm acting, and bottom line, I just want to enjoy myself and be a happy person, and acting makes me happy. I enjoy it, and it's a good way to escape yourself. You just become somebody else for a little bit, and it's a lot of fun.","I've done yoga, and it's fun, but I'm not the kind of person that can wake up and do it every morning. It's like, I have to be in the mood.","Chanel has always been this big thing for me - there are baby pictures of me wearing my mom's Chanel pumps.","My mom gave me a Chanel dress when I was younger. I felt special. I think anybody feels special in Chanel.","For as long as I can remember, I've just loved Chanel.","If you're shooting a really serious, dramatic scene, personally I wouldn't want to look at the camera.","I just shot my first dramatic movie in France, and for those dramatic scenes that I shot, I would not want to look at those. There's a certain mindset you have to put yourself into for those scenes, and looking at the monitor would just take you out of it.","It might be rare, but there are certain moments when you really don't feel like yourself. When you are in the character so fully, it's the best feeling ever. I so love it. Even if those moments come just once a day or every other day, they are just worth it.","I am a little into yoga.","Being able to feel free and comfortable in your character's skin is so important.","My parents weren't very strict. They've always trusted me to be independent and make my own decisions. There wasn't really anything to rebel against.","Just like food, you could think peanut butter is your favorite food for 5,000 years and then be like, 'I actually like burgers better', you know? I was just trying to say that kids and people in general don't have to label themselves and say, 'I'm straight' or 'I'm gay' or 'I'm whatever.'","You don't have to label yourself, because it's not set in stone. It's so fluid, and there's so much pressure on kids to label themselves and say, 'This is what I am; this is what I like.'","I was just trying to say that it's unnecessary; you don't need to label yourself. I guess it came off the wrong way, because then everyone labelled me as gay. That's not what I was trying to say. Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course!"],"Lin Biao":["One word from Chairman Mao is worth ten thousand from others. His every statement is truth. We must carry out those we that understand as well as those we don't.","In the final analysis, the whole cause of world revolution hinges on the revolutionary struggles of the Asian, African and Latin American people who make up the overwhelming majority of the world's population.","Taking the entire globe, if North America and Western Europe can be called the 'cities of the world', then Asia, Africa and Latin America constitute 'the rural areas of the world'."],"Lin Dan":["Win or lose, I believe in giving my best and that is what I always do.","Badminton is not only about winning. What is important to me is about playing hard, doing my best and putting up a good show for the spectators.","The biggest problem for badminton is wind direction and lighting. If those problems are not solved, it seriously impacts players' performances on the court. If a high-level player's performance is affected by these factors, they suffer setbacks and cannot be fully satisfied on the court.","It is our responsibility, but not burden, to be champions.","It is hard to compete with other sports. Badminton is a sport which, when compared with football and tennis, still needs promotion.","I love badminton, and representing China is an honour for me.","I hope wholeheartedly that badminton will be as popular and respected as tennis one day.","It should not all be about badminton.","Many people, including those from the BWF, don't really understand what the main problems in badminton are and what it most needs because many officials are not competitors.","I will take every match seriously and respect every opponent.","When I decided to come back, I wanted to prove to the rest of the world I'm still the best.","If you play a match, then you got to give it all to beat the opponent; there is nothing like playing against a great or a non-great player. I treat them all as opponents and aim to beat them.","It is for me to realise my value and put in the effort to win big tournaments.","When you fully focus in the match, you don't think too much about the atmosphere and the climate. Even if the temperature goes up, we will both sweat the same.","Lee Chong Wei is no doubt the best men's singles opponent I've played, and this gives me extra motivation to raise my game each time I play against him.","I'm no longer young, but I still enjoy the competition and the feeling of that.","Every time I am not playing, I am training harder to keep myself fit.","I still want to see the Lin-Lee rivalry; those games always bring great fun for the fans.","Success is not judged by just success in a particular championship.","I have played against many players, but I will always consider Lee Chong Wei as my toughest competitor.","I have admired Taufik Hidayat for being exceptionally talented and Hendrawan for being a great player only because of his hard work and dedication. I have always looked up to them as players.","Badminton is a cruel sport.","I have never considered any player as my competitor; each one of them is good and talented, and my job is to beat them.","It is difficult to single out any one player, as I aim to give my best against every single player that I have played so far against.","I am training 8-9 hours a day and will give my best shot for Rio.","During the off-season, I try to increase my practice sessions, and I am also training with my coaches.","Of course, in China, there's already plenty of people who like badminton. I'm hoping more foreigners, Americans, and other countries can get into this sport.","Being a professional athlete, we all want to win the title.","Team competition is my priority.","Of course every player wants to go from good to better, but one should not be obsessed with it.","Lee is such a brilliant rival. I treasure the opportunities we have to play each other.","I just want to play my game.","I hope Lee's scandal isn't real.","I am no genius; I just worked hard like my other teammates, and I believe all my teammates can win the title as they work hard, too.","I hope to play well and get better and better.","I am pleased with the fitness that I have.","I have worked very hard to achieve this. If others also work hard, they can also achieve as much.","I don't need to prove myself through competition anymore.","I hope to spend more time with my family.","I want to enjoy the life.","The gold medals from world championships and National Games prove the efficiency of my daily training.","At every Olympic Games, anything can happen that nobody can predict, so I did my best to win.","I need to practice every day to be at my best for winning the third gold at the Rio Olympics.","You don't just need skills and talent, you also need luck.","Marriage has changed things. I have my own family now.","In the past, my family made a lot of sacrifices. We never got to spend much time together because I was always training. I think now I need to spend as much time as I can with them. This is the life I should have.","Before I turned 30, through a lot of hard work and support, I won many badminton titles. But after turning 30, Lin Dan should change that mindset and start in a new direction and do things that are more meaningful.","I invite Mr. Lee Chong Wei to visit China frequently.","There is no secret. It is all about doing the same things time and time again. It is all about doing the best every day."],"Lin Shaye":["I may be the only actress in Hollywood who won't need a face lift, because when I take off my makeup, I look so great compared to my characters!","I'm not a blood and guts person. I remember seeing 'House of Wax' as a teenager in 3D. This was years ago, the original 'House of Wax', and that was scary enough for me that I thought I'd never see another one.","As an actor, whatever I get the opportunity to do, if it has a good story then I'm in. I thought 'Dead End' had a great story; 'Nightmare on Elm Street,' of course, was probably the first real horror film I was in.","I've never seen 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', I've never seen 'Halloween', I've never seen any of the 'Friday the 13ths.'","I just kind of do my thing with sort of tunnel vision for the story and my role and how it fits together.","I think the best advice I ever got about acting was from my dad, which was, 'If they don't buy the fish on the first toss, throw it back in the wagon and go to the second house.' Which is like an old Jewish fishmongers' story about how you become a successful fish monger.","I've gotten jobs that I think I've done the worst audition I ever did, and I got the job. I've done the best audition I've ever done in my entire life, and I haven't gotten the job.","I think the first thing is don't give up. If you love the craft. If you love being a detective and discovering who a character is and the detail of how they walk and what kind of shoes they wear and what did they do yesterday and what's important to them. I definitely advise actors to learn about the craft.","I've had a couple of odd experiences - unexplainable anxiety that came my way through a belief in something... I mean, it sounds cryptic, but... anything for me that turns myself against myself, I stay away from.","I try to keep away exterior events that are going to make me do something negative internally to myself.","I started in theater; I did theater in New York for 14 years before I even thought about doing movies - I never thought about being in a film; it just never occurred to me.","No matter how much I plan the overall arc of the character, you get there day one on the film and you shooting certain scenes first, and it goes completely different to anything you ever thought of, and then it's done."],"Lin Yutang":["If you can spend a perfectly useless afternoon in a perfectly useless manner, you have learned how to live.","A good traveller is one who does not know where he is going to, and a perfect traveller does not know where he came from.","No one realizes how beautiful it is to travel until he comes home and rests his head on his old, familiar pillow.","Today we are afraid of simple words like goodness and mercy and kindness. We don't believe in the good old words because we don't believe in good old values anymore. And that's why the world is sick.","The wise man reads both books and life itself.","Hope is like a road in the country; there was never a road, but when many people walk on it, the road comes into existence.","Society can exist only on the basis that there is some amount of polished lying and that no one says exactly what he thinks.","Our lives are not in the lap of the gods, but in the lap of our cooks.","Besides the noble art of getting things done, there is the noble art of leaving things undone. The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of non-essentials.","This I conceive to be the chemical function of humor: to change the character of our thought.","Where there are too many policemen, there is no liberty. Where there are too many soldiers, there is no peace. Where there are too many lawyers, there is no justice."],"Lin-Manuel Miranda":["I grew up in an immigrant neighborhood. We just knew the rule was you're going to have to work twice as hard.","The fun for me in collaboration is, one, working with other people just makes you smarter; that's proven.","History is so subjective. The teller of it determines it.","The musicals that leave us kind of staggering on our feet are the ones that really reach for a lot.","In 'Hamilton,' we're telling the stories of old, dead white men, but we're using actors of color, and that makes the story more immediate and more accessible to a contemporary audience.","I think I'm always subconsciously trying to write the ideal school play. Lots of parts for everybody, great parts for women - don't forget, more girls try out than boys in the school play; everyone gets to be in the school play.","The reason 'Hamilton' works is because there is no distance between that story that happened 200-some-odd years ago and now, because it looks like America now. It helps create a connection that wouldn't have been there if it was 20 white guys on stage.","The only shows I saw as a kid were that holy trinity: 'Les Miz,' 'Cats,' 'Phantom.'","In the best works of fiction, there's no mustache-twirling villain. I try to write shows where even the bad guy's got his reasons.","I only know how to write musicals.","Anytime you write something, you go through so many phases. You go through the 'I'm a Fraud' phase. You go through the 'I'll Never Finish' phase. And every once in a while you think, 'What if I actually have created what I set out to create, and it's received as such?'","My only responsibility as a playwright and a storyteller is to give you the time of your life in the theatre. I just happen to think that with Hamilton's story, sticking close to the facts helps me. All the most interesting things in the show happened.","There's been lots of theater that uses hip-hop in it, but more often than not, it's used as a joke - isn't it hilarious that these characters are rapping. I treat it as a musical form, and a musical form that allows you to pack in a ton of lyric.","I don't differentiate between black and Latino actors. We're in the same struggle to be represented in a way that's even close to honest. And I can tell you that the amount of Latino characters I can point at and say, 'That's what my life experience looks like' - I can't think of any off the top of my head besides Jimmy Smits in 'Mi Familia.'","Making words rhyme for a living is one of the great joys of my life... That's a superpower I've been very conscious of developing. I started at the same level as everybody else, and then I just listened to more music and talked to myself until it was an actual superpower I could pull out on special occasions.","We've had characters like Trump in American politics forever, characters who trade on xenophobia.","I always had an eye toward the stage for the story of Hamilton's life, but I began with the idea of a concept album, the way Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Evita' and 'Jesus Christ Superstar' were albums before they were musicals.","Because of the success of 'Hamilton' and 'On Your Feet!' you can't hide behind the old argument of, 'It needs to be bankable, so we can't put all these people of color in the show.' We are bankable.","You know what's a great way of tricking people into thinking you're a genius? Write a show about geniuses!","What 'Twilight Zone' did was show we all have a great capacity for good and evil.","'Rent' was the show that made me want to write. Or that showed me you're allowed to write.","If Hamilton were on Twitter, he would have been a worse oversharer than me.","What's incredible about 'Hamilton,' and the reason you can't get a ticket, is because everyone's responding to it. Everyone is seeing a bit of themselves in it.","I like to separate the music- and lyric-writing processes if I can. I'll sort of noodle around on my keyboard and my computer until I have a beat or a chord progression, I'll record it as a loop, export it to iTunes, then walk around with the loop and sort of talk to myself in the loop, and that's how I get the lyrics.","I kind of need to be ambulatory to write lyrics.","Sometimes a line enters your head, and you're so grateful for it. You go online to check to see if anyone wrote it before you. You must have stolen it.","When I was asked to do a song from 'In the Heights' at the White House in 2009, I chose instead to do 'Alexander Hamilton' because I felt like I was meeting a moment.","I can't say I have enough experience with Hollywood to feel that I've encountered racism there. I can tell you that I did about five fruitless years of auditioning for voiceovers where I did variations on tacos and Latin accents, and my first screen role was as a bellhop on 'The Sopranos.'","I like the quiet it takes to pursue an idea the way I pursued 'Hamilton,' but I couldn't write a book, because there's no applause at the end of writing a book.","Pretty much anything William Shatner is in is great. He's great at playing that 'I'm the only one sane in the world' character.","If there is a Busta Rhymes of musical theater, it probably is Mandy Patinkin.","What I learned from my go-round with 'In the Heights' is that it's tough to make a movie. In Hollywood, even the people in charge have people in charge.","I made a movie when I was 15 years old with all my friends. This is when IMDb was a little more lax with its proceedings, so it's listed as one of my projects. I was 15 years old; it's a terrible movie. I wrote 50 percent of it because I wanted to kiss this one girl, and I wrote a kissing scene for it.","I'm honored to have been chosen as a fellow of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. I am hugely appreciative for the support I have had throughout my life, and I look forward to using the grant to help institutions that have fed my soul and to support new work that inspires me.","Everything we know about Hamilton, we knew when he was alive, because he told us.","I couldn't possibly write 'Next to Normal,' but God, I can weep and watch 'Next to Normal' five times.","One of my first favorite books was 'The 12 Days of Christmas,' and I would just go up to people and say, 'I can sing 'The 12 Days of Christmas,' and I would make them sit through me reciting it, and I'd go all the way, each time. I've always hooked into lyrics.","Biggie and Big Pun were the best storytellers of the '90s. I would get wrapped up in the narrative of what they were talking about.","'West Wing' was huge. Like 'Hamilton,' it pulls back the curtain on how decision-making happens at the highest level, or at least how you hope it would be. The amount of information Aaron Sorkin packs into a scene gave me this courage to trust the audience to keep up.","The only other thing that's like video games for me is watching tennis on TV. I can have it on, and there's a rhythmic quality to it - I can be watching Wimbledon or the U.S. Open and still be working.","We love 'Fiddler.' We love 'West Side Story.' I want to be in that club. I want to be in the club that writes the musical that every high school does.","A lot of the reason the Universal version of 'Heights' went away is that they were afraid they didn't have a big enough Latino star to bankroll this movie. The people I dealt with at the studio who wanted to make this movie were very passionate about it.","You could do a 'Les Mis'-type musical about Hamilton, but it would have to be 12 hours long, because the amount of words on the bars when you're writing a typical song - that's maybe got 10 words per line."],"Lina Wertmuller":["I love life. I love my friends. I love to eat. Too many things, I love. I am very much an anti-historical character. I am attracted to happy people. Happy people with very grave problems.","When I was young, I ran to see Astaire and Rogers, Huston, Lubitsch - they were formative for me. I also read 'Flash Gordon' when I was 6, but if I were still reading it when I was 16, I'd have been an imbecile.","I adore the work of Lucas and Spielberg. I'm certainly not trying to minimize their talents, but I'd love to see what they could do when they aren't leading us from reality.","Prizes are like butterflies, colorful butterflies that fly away. I don't believe in prizes much.","Even American artists are terrorized by market forces. If one can't see the films, my wings are clipped. I am no longer concerned about this, because I'm focused on making films. Perhaps one day someone who discovers sunken treasures will reexamine my 35 or 36 films - I hope it will be 40 or 50 before I die.","I know they call me a crazy lady, but I'm only interested in making movies and having people see them.","When I was a girl, we all wanted to have fun. That's all we thought about. It didn't occur to us to get married and have babies.","Some feminists have this party-line attitude, and they can be very extremist. The most enlightened characters in my film are women.","Ah, in work, love and the movies, everything is a fight.","Film is my big problem. I am involved too much. I love too much. I've been trying to resolve it for 35 years now, but for now, I have to keep making them.","For years, the feminists thought of me as an army sergeant. I was too macho for them.","I am a director. I'm the one who can order men around.","My first customer is myself. When I tell a story I like, I can sleep easy. I'm sorry when audiences don't like it, but I have no choice.","I've always been an angel. Sometimes I transform into a witch only because the filmmaking demands it."],"Lincoln Chafee":["Trust is built with consistency.","In the world of diplomacy, some things are better left unsaid.","America stood at the summit of power, emerging from the Cold War as an economic, cultural and military force without equal.","The lack of fiscal responsibility is one of the main reasons I finally left my old Party.","Reform of the medical liability system should be considered as part of a comprehensive response to surging medical malpractice premiums that endanger Americans' access to quality medical care.","In the executive branch, winning by a whisker is as good as winning in a landslide, but not so in the Senate.","I worry about 10, 15, 20, 25 years down the road. Where are we going to be in this age of nuclear weapons, where there is no margin for error?","American education is still the wonder of the world, and we must open the schoolhouse doors, not close them.","Israelis can be proud of the vibrant democracy that they have created, and I know that many Rhode Islanders share my deep appreciation for the close friendship between our two nations.","On the issues that I care deeply about - the environment, Roe vs. Wade, the war in Iraq, with no weapons of mass destruction, the tax cuts that are now leading to deficits, I've got some deep issues with the president.","Well, usually when you talk about a mandate, you're talking about an overwhelming win. I don't think by any measurement the 2004 election was an overwhelming win.","I was born in 1953, so that's the Eisenhower administration.","I remember my Republican Party as fiscally conservative, as caring about the environment.","Anger's not a good emotion.","I had supported Governor George W. Bush over Senator John McCain in the 2000 Rhode Island presidential primary.","As a former Republican, I represent a group of Americans who all too often have no one to speak for them. This group doesn't necessarily have a name. We've been called 'moderates,' but that term can be misleading.","President Obama knows that wars are not to be entered into lightly; he knows that overseas conflicts don't only do damage in the land in which they are fought, but in the land of those who fight them, as well.","Let me ask you: Should only children of the wealthy have access to quality early education? Should only children of the wealthy have access to a college degree? The answer - the only answer - is: no.","A strong, educated middle class is what made America the greatest country in the world.","Students of America, working families of America: President Obama will not turn his back on you."],"Lincoln Child":["I try to write about things, places, events, and phenomena I know about personally. That helps make the novels more genuine.","My first job out of college was as an editorial assistant in a New York publishing house. Being an editorial assistant is the purgatory would-be editors must endure before they can ascend the ladder and begin acquiring books on their own. I spent a year filing paperwork, writing copy, and typing rejection letters.","For me, writing never gets easier. It's always hard work. It doesn't matter how many words you wrote the day before, or how many novels you've completed in the last decade: every day you start fresh again with that same blank page, or that same blank screen.","I can't listen to music while writing - any such distraction would have dreadful consequences.","The funny thing about writing is I think a lot of people assume that you're sitting in a garret with a quill pen for hour after hour.","Writing on your own is, in a way, a very lonely profession. There's no one there to help you.","There are some writers I think who love to go around and visit bookstores and just interact."],"Lincoln Davis":["We have lost one shuttle for every 57 flights and that is not a good ratio. I do believe we need to continue space flights, but maybe we can follow the example of the Russians and use unmanned vehicles to transport hardware into space.","I think Democrats keep the commandments of the Lord more.","I'm a farm boy. If we need five people to haul in hay, we don't take one and just work them to death."],"Lincoln Diaz-Balart":["Perseverance and perspective until victory.","Unfortunately, writing and reporting the truth is not allowed under Castro's tyrannical dictatorship.","To finalize, the purpose of an election is to hear the will of the people, not to fabricate votes.","One of my top priorities in Congress is to reduce U.S. dependence on fossil fuels.","One of the achievements of which I am most proud was the codification, the writing into U.S. law, of the U.S. embargo on the Castro dictatorship.","I am convinced that in the upcoming chapter of the struggle, I can be more useful to the inevitable change that will soon come to Cuba, to Cuba's freedom, as a private citizen dedicated to helping the heroes within Cuba.","Today I am announcing that I will not seek a tenth term in the United States Congress this November.","We take our endorsements seriously.","I haven't been given many things, but I've been given ample, limitless patience."],"Lincoln Ellsworth":["Not until, years later, I found my true interest in life did I discover that I could master a subject, no matter how difficult, if it helped me in what I wanted to do.","If I did not have for him the warm affection a son feels toward a less austere and preoccupied father, I at least had an immense respect for him, and a great admiration.","One of the things that made me persist in the Antarctic in the face of sickening discouragements was my determination to name a portion of the earth's surface after my father."],"Lincoln Kirstein":["Harvard was a kind of luxurious afternoon.","In liberal democracy and anxious anarchy, the traditional classic dance, compact of aristocratic authority and absolute freedom in a necessity of order, has never been so promising as an independent expression as it is today.","She was chronologically in luck. She corresponded to necessity."],"Lincoln Steffens":["Art is like a border of flowers along the course of civilization.","You ask men in office to be honest; I ask them to serve the public.","I am really puzzled to understand myself.","In all cities, the better classes - the business men - are the sources of corruption, but they are so rarely pursued and caught that we do not fully realize whence the trouble comes.","Power is what men seek and any group that gets it will abuse it.","The longer I live, the more I feel that the individual is not so much to blame - not even the worst individuals, not even the 'best' citizens - as the system of corruption which has grown up about us, and which rewards an honest man with a mere living and a crook with all the magnificence of our magnificent modern life.","If our political leaders are to be always a lot of political merchants, they will supply any demand we may create. All we have to do is to establish a steady demand for good government.","Morality is only moral when it is voluntary.","I have been over into the future, and it works.","If my father could watch my son for a while, he might realize his own immortality.","Boston has carried the practice of hypocrisy to the n-th degree of refinement, grace, and failure.","The misgovernment of the American people is misgovernment by the American people.","If we would leave parties to the politicians, and would vote not for the party, not even for men, but for the city, and the State, and the nation, we should rule parties, and cities, and States, and nation.","The commercial spirit is the spirit of profit, not patriotism; of credit, not honor; of individual gain, not national prosperity; of trade and dickering, not principle.","My father would invite me sweetly to come and sit on a stool at his feet, and, as I let myself trustingly down, he would gently kick the seat from under me - and laugh.","My father, the practical joker, did not care for practical jokes on himself; he did not encourage the practice in me.","Whenever anything extraordinary is done in American municipal politics, whether for good or for evil, you can trace it almost invariably to one man. The people do not do it. Neither do the 'gangs,' 'combines,' or political parties.","Chicago will give you a chance. The sporting spirit is the spirit of Chicago.","The Russian people, sober, are said to be a gentle people.","It is possible to get an education at a university. It has been done; not often.","Nothing fails like success.","The doctrine of Jesus is the most revolutionary propaganda that I have ever encountered.","My mother would thump me sharply on the head with a thimble or a spoon if I became too noisy with the whistle when I was playing I was a steamboat captain. She had no sense of the dignity of command.","One improvement I have learned from my childhood experience with my father: I do not threaten punishment in the morning. That was awful. Late into the night I would lie awake tossing and wondering what he was going to do to me. Usually he did nothing. A quiet, impressive 'talking to' was all I got.","My father made with me one serious mistake which I see parents about me making. He got himself somehow into the awkward position of an authority; I thought he knew and was right on everything - for a while.","I let my boy go and do and say pretty much as he likes, as, and perhaps because, my father kept no string on me.","If we would vote in mass on the more promising ticket, or, if the two are equally bad, would throw out the party that is in, and wait till the next election and then throw out the other party that is in - then, I say, the commercial politician would feel a demand for good government and he would supply it.","The spirit of graft and of lawlessness is the American spirit.","I have been contending all my life, and always with God.","We need some great failures. Especially we ever-successful Americans - conscious, intelligent, illuminating failures.","Revolt is not reform, and one revolutionary administration is not good government.","I never heard a Christian sermon preached in a church.","Most men think graft a sporadic evil, breaking out here and there, with no connection between outbreaks. I shared the same opinion, but very soon I discovered that the graft in the cities always leads to the graft in the State.","The typical American citizen is the business man. The typical business man is a bad citizen; he is busy. If he is a 'big business man' and very busy, he does not neglect; he is busy with politics, oh, very busy and very businesslike.","The Soviet government sprouted and grew out of the habits, the psychology, and the condition of the Russian people. It fitted them. They understand it.","My father required me to honor my father and my mother too much to put up games on them. I did on occasion.","My father was slower, but he was severer than my mother, who was quick but light and irregular in discipline.","My father seemed always to know not only what I was doing, but what I was being."],"Linda Blair":["People always joke that 'dog' spells 'god' backwards. They should consider that it might be the higher power coming down to see just how well they do, what kind of people they are. The animals are right here, right in front of us. And how we treat these companions is a test.","It's difficult to understand why people don't realize that pets are gifts to mankind.","I was so sad from losing two of my dogs and my mother. I had this vision of all these animals sitting behind bars. They had no control and were scared. That's why I got into fostering and adopting animals out.","The animals are right here, right in front of us. And how we treat these companions is a test.","Kids shouldn't see all the violence they do these days. But the industry just doesn't care.","When I was 13 I asked my mother if it was possible for this to end - I'd had enough of it. And that was right about the time that we got a call for 'The Exorcist' interview.","To ignore one's spiritual self is unsettling, to say the least. That's a very profound outlook on it.","There was a golden retriever who saved countless lives on September 11 by going back in to find people. His companion was in a wheelchair. He got him out and kept going back in to save others.","The Exorcist has been a very interesting cross to bear.","One of the reasons I don't have kids is because I think people would have been very unfair to them. Think of it. You're still asking me questions about The Exorcist.","Of all the projects I've worked on, I've never worked with another director like Billy Friedkin. I think he's a genius.","If I had children, I would be very selfish. I wouldn't be out doing things. But by not having kids, it makes me freer to travel the world and talk about things I feel are important.","I've lived through what seems to most - and myself - many lives."],"Linda Cardellini":["People who have no idea it's me when they first see me playing something, and later they realize, 'That's her from whatever it is,' it's a great compliment that they can forget.","Yes, I'm very close to my family. And being that close to your family, I think you also struggle with how to become your own person.","I think everyone feels lost at times during their high school years.","I just got back from Switzerland, which I've never been to. I went to Switzerland and Amsterdam.","I always thought I was a little shy, especially compared to my brother and my sister, but I guess I was always the kid doing performances in the front room.","I think I'm going to spend some time learning how to be a first-time mom, and then I'll go back to work.","After I finished 'E.R.', I wanted to concentrate on re-examining what kind of actress I am and taking time for real-life things.","I think in real life most of us don't know how to communicate our deepest feelings very well.","The one thing about being on 'ER' that has changed is that I'm more easily recognizable.","I had a really scary pregnancy and a very difficult delivery. My daughter and I are lucky to be alive.","I remember when I took the role on E.R., I thought, 'I haven't really been able to play a working class woman. I've played girls, I've played funny, but I haven't played a working class woman. That sounds like something I'd like to do.'","One thing I like about trying to write is that I can possibly write myself a role. Otherwise, you're at the mercy of whatever roles are out there that people are willing to give to you.","I was extremely close with my parents. Breaking away from that is a double-edged sword: It's something you need to do, but it's hard to cut the apron strings.","When I was a kid, 'Scooby Doo' was, hands down, my favorite cartoon. Even when I was older, when I was in college studying and I needed to tune out for a while, I'd watch 'Scooby Doo.'","I love to work on a set whether it's mostly men or mostly women, but there's something about being in a community of women that changes the energy.","There are not that many jobs as an actor where you don't get to know what your character will be doing from episode to episode.","I have sort of the career where, if you are a fan, you've been following me for a while, and you really like something that I've done, so meeting those people is always a really gracious experience.","I like diversity; I want one character to be very different from the next. I love to live with a character for a long time if I can, but I like one character to be different from the next.","One of my favorite things to do is not to speak on screen. In theater it's different because there's a lot of emphasis on language - it's a different medium. But that is one of the most wonderful things about film. A person's face can say so much more than their voice can.","Being raised Catholic myself, I think people who are Catholic tend to carry a lot of guilt. It's almost a joke.","You know, the hard thing about audiences not liking what a character does is that they sometimes take it out on the actor personally. That's something that you know when you become an actor or actress, but it's always hard to deal with when it actually happens.","Before I could talk, I would try to sing."],"Linda Chavez":["The United Nations was founded in the aftermath of World War II, just as the world was beginning to learn the full horrors of history's worst genocide, the Holocaust that consumed 6 million Jews and 3 million others in Europe.","Liberals believe they own the franchise on minorities and can't stand any Hispanic or black who breaks rank.","The United Nations has become a largely irrelevant, if not positively destructive institution, and the just-released U.N. report on the atrocities in Darfur, Sudan, proves the point.","Some 43 percent of voters in union households voted for President Bush in 2004, according to exit poll data.","The terrorists hide behind Allah.","Although an increasing proportion of the Hispanic population is foreign-born - about half of adults in this group - English proficiency is and should remain a requirement for citizenship.","Britons seem to have given up on assimilating their Muslim population, with many British elites patting themselves on the back for their tolerance and multiculturalism.","Choosing one's leaders is an affirmation that the person making the choice has inherent worth.","For generations, even many otherwise decent white Southerners learned to despise black people.","From George Washington to George W. Bush, presidents have invoked God's name in the performance of their official duties.","In fact, the U.S. military has bent over backwards to respect the religious beliefs of some very dangerous fanatics who want to kill us.","Journalists are supposed to be skeptical, that's what keeps them digging rather than simply accepting the official line, whether it comes from government or corporate bureaucrats.","Less than 8 percent of private sector workers belonged to a union in 2004, and, overall, only 12.5 percent of American workers carry a union card - down from about one-third of workers in labor's heydays in the 1950s.","Many journalists seem to believe that we have become little different from our enemies.","Modesty used to be considered a natural female attribute. No more.","Neither the wording of the amendment itself nor common practice challenged the widely held belief that government guaranteed freedom of religion, not freedom from religion.","One of the techniques terrorists employ is to allege torture and mistreatment when they are captured, regardless of whether it is true.","Since January 2002, when the United States began detaining at Guantanamo Bay enemy combatants captured in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other fronts in the war on terror, critics have complained of human rights abuses.","The U.S. has already suffered a devastating attack on September 11, 2001, and may again become a target.","The unions claim the deck is stacked against them when it comes to labor laws, but the truth is many private and public sector workers are forced to pay union dues as a condition of their employment, yet they have little say in how the unions spend their money.","Their prejudice allowed white Southerners to look the other way when blacks were denied their most basic human rights, and it encouraged the worst of them to engage in unspeakable acts of cruelty and violence.","Where journalists have gotten themselves in trouble over the last few decades is that their skepticism often extends only to American officials, the U.S. military and Republican politicians."],"Linda Ellerbee":["People are pretty much alike. It's only that our differences are more susceptible to definition than our similarities.","I think laughter may be a form of courage. As humans we sometimes stand tall and look into the sun and laugh, and I think we are never more brave than when we do that.","I have always felt that laughter in the face of reality is probably the finest sound there is and will last until the day when the game is called on account of darkness. In this world, a good time to laugh is any time you can.","The new national campfire - radio.","If you believe in your heart that you are right, you must fight with all your might to do it your way. Only dead fish swim with the stream all the time.","If men can run the world, why can't they stop wearing neckties? How intelligent is it to start the day by tying a little noose around your neck?","Time doesn't go. Time stays. We go.","Styles, like everything else, change. Style doesn't.","When the anchorman is wearing a colonel's uniform, it tells you something."],"Linda Evangelista":["God help anyone who disobeys my recycling system. I have all the separated bins. I'm very adamant about it because I try to be a good citizen of the world, I really do. I even use eco-friendly cleaning products, but sometimes you just have to break open the disinfectant. Some jobs require it.","People think modeling's mindless, that you just stand there and pose, but it doesn't have to be that way. I like to have a lot of input. I know how to wear a dress, whether it should be shot with me standing or sitting.","I don't get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day.","We don't vogue, we are 'Vogue'.","I never get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day.","It was God who made me so beautiful. If I weren't, then I'd be a teacher.","If they had Nautilus on the Concorde, I would work out all the time.","On days when I do not work, I am working on my image.","Fashion faux pas should be celebrated. I enjoy them because it means we're not all clones.","I don't happen to think magazines should be full of thin people. What I do say is that we can all work a little harder with what we have. It is possible to achieve a better body shape and heart rate with nutrition and exercise.","I can do anything you want me to do so long as I don't have to speak.","I did that Dior Couture 60th anniversary show in July. It took so long to get ready, I think I would have rather been watching.","When I work, it can be a 16-hour day.","I have to hit the gym. I have beauty appointments. I have to work toward my next job and maintaining my image, just like an athlete.","We have this expression, Christy and I. We don't wake up for less than $10,000 a day.","I love, love, love fashion so much. That's why I became a model in the first place.","Being a rock star was out of the question. I can't sing.","When I started in the business, I was told I had three good years in me.","When people ask how have I kept on top, I have to say with the help of every photographer, make-up artist and hairdresser I've ever worked with.","As long as designers want to dress me, photographers want to take my picture and companies think my face will help their products, then I won't go anywhere until they're done with me.","I'm so glad this worked out for me, I do think I know how to be a good model.","I never, ever used my son for publicity. He'll have his say one day if he wants it. He'll have the last word. He has time to defend himself.","Within two months I made the grand slam: covers of 'American Vogue', 'Italian Vogue', 'British Vogue', and 'French Vogue'.","Sure, I like my short hair. It also quadrupled my rate. I did get sick of seeing it on everybody, though - every stewardess, every salesclerk, and in every restaurant.","I'm part of a team that raises millions of dollars and raises awareness of HIV and AIDS all over the world.","I had no illusions that my career would be any longer than three years tops.","I know that sometimes the chemistry just isn't there between the model, photographer, hair and make-up. It's nobody's fault and you just have to do better next time.","I have turned down so many major advertising bids because I think either the time isn't right or I'm not.","Designers and photographers still want to work with me and I'm grateful for that. I don't know how long I'll carry on - as long as they'll have me.","I don't get cast for every job and I understand that.","I eat super healthy and I'm super fit. I dabble in every type of fitness. I have a trainer and I go to the gym. I do yoga as well.","Why would I be embarrassed about being Canadian? I'm very proud. We're just the nicest people. Everyone likes us.","Hair is the greatest thing to experiment with because it's not permanent. If I didn't like my colour, I'd just change it.","I don't diet. I just don't eat as much as I'd like to.","On days when I do not work, I am working on my image. I have to hit the gym. I have beauty appointments. I have to work toward my next job and maintaining my image, just like an athlete."],"Linda Evans":["If there's no inner peace, people can't give it to you. The husband can't give it to you. Your children can't give it to you. You have to give it to you.","I always looked for a man to rescue me and bring me happiness. I bought into that myth, of course, and looked for my own Prince Charming.","Money to me is just the biggest blessing in the world that allows me freedom.","I wanted to be able to go shopping without people looking to see if I really was one of the world's 10 most beautiful women. I longed to be myself.","I just fell in love with his music. I thought Yanni was Japanese. I didn't have any idea what a Yanni was. I just thought I was in love with a Japanese man who wrote beautiful music.","I was born in Connecticut. But my parents brought my sister and I to L.A. when-Hollywood, actually, when i was 6 months old.","My first speaking part was to read for John Forsythe for Bachelor Father. I was the lead, opposite him.","I was looking very much for a career. My second marriage to Stan Herman had ended, and I wanted very much to be independent, not take alimony from him, be on my own, do the right thing.","Aaron Spelling went further than anyone has ever gone for television.","You can take Elvis. You can take Marilyn Monroe. Success and fame will not be the answer if something inside of you is bothering you, if things in your mind aren't going right.","Nobody's got it made. Nobody, no matter what they look like.","I have had work done.","I never saved my money. Whenever I worked in the past, I would spend it on my family or my husbands.","You cry tears when a man leaves you at any age - it doesn't matter whether you are 20 or 60.","I no longer need to be someone's wife. I'm doing okay as I am.","It doesn't matter if I don't succeed in something, what matters is that I learn from my mistakes.","I'm not obsessed by how I look or with being reed thin, but I do think that as a woman in my 50s, I have 40 years ahead. Looking after yourself goes hand in hand with looking good.","Right after Dynasty ended I had a facelift and laser surgery to get rid of lines around my eyes.","I didn't want to make a man the No. 1 quest in my life.","I played with dolls until I was 15. My mother encouraged it because my older sister got married when she was 15, so Mom thought that the longer I stayed with dolls, the better.","Find out what you don't want to know about yourself, what you're afraid of."],"Linda Fiorentino":["In the end it's about the work, not an award you get for the work.","Sometimes the only thing we women want is a dick and no arguments. What could make us happier?","You can talk about movies all you want, but I have this porcelain fetish. I've had it since I was a kid, because there were so many kids in my family, the only place I had any solace was in the bathroom.","All I'm thinking about today is cleaning my bathroom.","As actors, the thing we have to fight, more than even the business part of making movies, is boredom.","Chazz Palminteri is just the ultimate screen husband.","He allowed us to choreograph the sex scenes.","I don't look at scripts in terms of commerciality. I just look at the part, the people involved.","I go to bed with men, not boys.","I never wear leather.","I would like to do maybe a smaller romantic comedy.","I would love to have children, yes. Maybe even adopt them. I'm not sure that I should pass on my genes.","I'm convinced my mother only had sex eight times.","I've been in the bargain basement of the movie business.","If I'm not afraid when I'm reading a script, that means I know I've done it before. If I read something and think, Wow, I can't play this part, then I want to play it more.","It didn't rain today, so I didn't have to work. Why don't you have to sit around and wait until it rains?","Marriage is a financial contract; I have enough contracts already.","People over 30 are interested in sex too, but they get real movies about it.","Teens aren't just interested in getting laid. I won't believe that's all they're interested in. I have four younger sisters and they're sick of being shown how they're supposed to react in bed.","They're my favorite two words these days: Oscar reject."],"Linda Grant":["It became obvious to me that the generation who changed the world were my parents' generation, and not only in terms of the Second World War, but if you look at all the social legislation of the '60s - abortion, homosexual law reform, equal pay - it wasn't done by my generation; it was done by people who were adults.","I am not by any stretch of the imagination a tidy person, and the piles of unread books on the coffee table and by my bed have a plaintive, pleading quality to me - 'Read me, please!'","I was embarrassed by my parents. I thought they had nothing of interest to say or contribute to anything. My real crime was not understanding that they were interesting, and I have been trying to make it up to them for being so indescribably blase, so genuinely uninterested and dismissive.","I'm not shy, not reclusive, not any of those things, but the idea of a day in front of me when I have nothing to do, is just, oh what pleasure!","I'm a really hectic dreamer; I never wake up not out of a dream, and there's loads going on, lots of action, big blockbuster dreams, they're all major enterprises.","When I was in my 20s in the 1970s, I read all of Jean Rhys. I have reread very little since because the first impressions were so powerful they have stayed with me.","When I was 20 I was immensely proud of the rows of grey-spined Penguin Modern Classics in my bookcase.","When I was a child, on Sunday mornings the family would assemble around the blue-leather-covered gramophone to listen to records.","Times were very hard if you were a poor, politically correct Jewish girl living in the east end of London during the Blitz and you were trying to eke out a living as a hairdresser."],"Linda Gray":["I think any woman can be transformed by a beautiful dress and high heels.","I always tell people that my life is in pencil; I have to keep an eraser in my hand because I could always get a call that could change everything.","I think people love shows that are relationship-oriented. I think they love family shows.","Look at history; all the interesting women were deeply flawed.","You make a mistake, you keep going.","I feel better if I exercise and eat healthily.","I've had a very laughable career and what has seen me through is my sense of humor.","I don't do fad things or diets - they don't work.","I love dark chocolate, but I will have a piece just occasionally.","I need to live a long time to fulfil all the things I want to do.","People always say that Californian women are obsessed with their appearance but I think you've got to take good care of yourself, for yourself.","Larry Hagman was my best friend for 35 years. He was the Pied Piper of life and brought joy to everyone he knew.","I'm extremely blessed because I travel extensively for my work, but I always try to incorporate a bit of leisure with business.","Aeroplane journeys give me quiet time to read and sleep; it's like being unplugged from the earth.","If you don't like your wrinkles and you think Botox or surgery is going to fix it, do it and shut up. But don't keep talking about it.","I am not obsessive about anything except my health."],"Linda Hamilton":["I carry Yeats with me wherever I go. He's my constant companion. I always can find some comfort in Yeats no matter what the situation is. Months and months and months go by and I know I need to switch to Shelley or somebody else, but right now Yeats is enough for me.","I try to keep a balance. I actually believe that children want normal parents, they don't want celebrities or important parents or anything different from all the other parents.","My heart is so light that it's amazing. I get to play all this grief, all this loss, all this disaster and chaos. It's hysterically funny. I am very light.","Well, I think it's important to stand as an advocate for the mentally ill.","My journey has been so full of struggle and I just want to be able to offer some help and some general ideas to people that really need it the most.","It's the age of information and we need to just get as informed as we can about what other things might help us live healthy lives.","As a teenager, even as a younger girl, I had some depression but no one really noticed that it was depression nor did I know in those days that that's what it was but I did feel different from other people."],"Linda Hunt":["When I was growing up, particularly during puberty in my teen years, I was so miserable because I elicited so much teasing and meanness from my teenage cohorts.","I can't be a man. But I can embrace the head of a man, the intelligence of a man, the spirit of a man.","I was always trying to make up for my size, to compensate. So to get people to take you seriously, you have to come at things with a great deal of strength. You have to emphasize that the way you are is unusual. That you don't come along every day.","Everybody either wanted to take care of me or push me around, you know? I was teased a lot, sure I was, of course. Fourth grade, fifth grade, sixth grade, everybody was taking their spurts except me. I was not growing up.","When I was 16, nobody else talked like me. Nobody else sounded like me.","What's it like being opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger? For me? Are you kidding? Maybe if I'm lucky, come up to his navel!","I think people have always liked in me the combination of being the underdog because I'm a tiny woman but I have enormous authority in myself.","For a while, I thought, maybe I should direct, until I got to New York and saw the stupidity of that idea. If it's hard to get into acting, what is it like for a woman to become a director?","For me to want to be an actor was an improbable idea. I wasn't beautiful or pretty in any conventional way. I wasn't an ingenue at 22. But I was always certain of it and certain of its power. I felt the power when I went to the theater at 9, 10, 12 and 14.","It really hit home that my parents felt as though they didn't have to worry anymore. They realized if you could win an Oscar, that was a good sign.","I have a surfboard that says 'Linda Hunt Choice TV Actress: Action.' I am an action star! I don't know what that is about, but I like it.","I aspired to be extremely sophisticated.","People are always casting me for what they call my 'authority.'"],"Linda Johnson Rice":["The horse is my favorite animal.","My playground was our company. That's really where I grew up.","The key is to service a market that has not been serviced to its full potential.","We have signed an exclusive licensing agreement with a company called TurnerPatterson, another African-American company, and what I thought would be a great vehicle for 'Ebony,' since it is such a strong brand name with tremendous loyalty, is to grow that brand name even more across different areas.","I think I'm curious by nature because I always want to learn, and I think you can learn from so many things around you on an everyday basis.","They couldn't have a little kid occupying an important spot on the front row, so I sat in the back where all the models changed clothes. I remember vividly the rustling and the rush of the fabrics of the clothes and the swoosh of textures and color as they went by. I was in the back, but I had a front-row seat, in my opinion.","We're the curator for the African-American experience for the past, present and future. That's my job.","There's a sense of authenticity that comes with 'Ebony.' There are very few national media outlets that are majority-African-American owned and really speak to our community with a sense of pride, authority, and ownership. That's what we do.","We have to tell our story at 'Ebony' and 'Jet' like no one else can. We have the authenticity; we have the believability. And I think that's what we have to own.","You have to stay current to compete.","My father is the CEO, and there's no question he is my boss. But we work very much in tandem.","I would describe my mother as a steel magnolia. She was very intelligent, very persuasive.","We have to reach out to younger audiences. They need to see how they can see themselves as black women.","We're not trying to push the real provocative edge.","There was never a push for us to become more practical... Fantasy is what our audience has come to expect.","I'm not so sure we've influenced the general market. But I'm not sure we're trying to do that.","There's nothing you can't wear. There's nothing you can't do.","We kept everything: every major event that's happened to African-Americans since 1945, with 'Ebony' as a repository for all those photographs and as a voice for all that happened.","We've been here so long. The history and richness runs so deep within the community. We own this. It's personal. It's very personal.","'Ebony' is very inspirational and aspirational to its readers.","We're in the media business. We're in the beauty business.","We are well-positioned to continue my father's legacy and move these businesses forward in the future.","I am delighted to resume the leadership of both companies.","Johnson Publishing Co. has always had a first-class image. And until the day I die, I want to keep that image.","In regards to black people, we have a treasure trove of information that nobody else really has.","A black entrepreneur has to be equally if not more prepared than a white to get his fair share of loan money.","I think somebody's got to be cutting-edge. It just depends how you want to market your magazines and how big you want them to be. We look upon competition as what it is. It's there, you pay attention to it, but you don't live by it. You have to go on and grind it out day to day and do the best you can with your magazine every single day.","Almost 63 years ago, my father, John Johnson, named the publication 'Jet' because, as he said in the first issue, 'In the world today, everything is moving faster. There is more news and far less time to read it.' He could not have spoken truer words. We are not saying goodbye to 'Jet'; we are embracing the future as my father did in 1951.","'Ebony' has been more than a magazine; it is a movement.","I am struck by the memories of all of the fantastic Links ladies who worked so hard to host the Ebony Fashion Fair shows.","JP Morgan Chase's investment in our firm is a logical outgrowth of our longstanding relationship.","My father's legacy is bigger than a building. It really is a tremendous business that he's built.","I don't know about you, but I've never been able to go into a store and buy a pair of jeans off the rack that fit perfectly.","We like to keep it short. If a story warrants more in-depth coverage, we will do it.","In light of the overall economic challenges that are affecting many, including our potential corporate sponsors, we have arrived at a most difficult decision to cancel Ebony Fashion Fair's fall 2009 season.","It is a sign of my mother's determination, confidence, and creativity that more than 50 years after launching the renowned Ebony Fashion Fair show, her timeless sense of style endures as a guidepost for today's fashion-loving women.","Johnson Publishing has been built on filling a need for African-Americans. This is what's happening with E Style. There was nothing that addressed the specific needs of African-American women.","We are going to do extensive market research because it is hard for black women to go into stores and get clothes that fit the way they should.","More black women are in the professional-managerial field, and they don't want to look like the guys sitting next to them in pinstriped suits.","'Ebony' is an integral part of my life, and I think it's very exciting to be able to help to move the brand forward.","I think you will find that a lot of young African-Americans are really searching for, 'Who am I?' and 'Where did I come from?' and 'What is my past?'","It was the Cosby family on the cover, but overlaid on that, it appeared to be a shattered glass. So it really wasn't just about the shattering of the Huxtables: it was really a shattering of the black family. And it was a question about that and where do we stand on that.","The bitter might be just an initial reaction of, 'Oh my goodness, it's sold,' but not really understanding fully that I will be chairman emeritus of the new company, which is Ebony Media Operations. It is African-American led and owned, and I have a seat on the board, and I also have an equity position in the company, so I'm still there.","I think the most challenging aspect from my father's perspective was probably getting advertising. He really did pattern 'Ebony' after 'Look' and 'Life' magazines.","We understand our audience. We write to the things that concern our audience. At one point, it was civil rights. You know, during the '50s and '60s, we were at the forefront.","The stories of accomplishments, achievements, challenges, problems, issues, concerns pass down through history, and those are things you take with you in your personal life wherever you go.","I have always drawn strength from my late mother's life. When Eunice Johnson set up the first major fashion show for African-American audiences more than 50 years ago, she did so at a time when black Americans, especially black women, were still fighting for a seat at the table - any table.","Fairness and equality means that what you are never limits who you can be. It means that a young African-American man like my father can start a business with $500 and a dream. It means that a young African-American woman like my mother can walk into European fashion houses with her head held high and be treated with respect.","We know in our hearts that none of us get ahead when some of us are stuck with second-class status.","My family has always made Chicago our home, and I care deeply about the values our company has espoused for decades.","The magazines were born out of a need that my parents saw: that there were no magazines that really spoke to black people. 'Ebony' wrote about architects and artists, the share cropper who sent his nine kids to college, real African Americans at a time when everyone else only covered them as entertainers and athletes.","'Ebony''s Power 100 list highlights African-Americans who exemplify brilliance in the fields of entertainment, arts, business and others.","Along with my father, Mandela is my hero.","I've been riding since I was seven. If I were a horse, I would want an Hermes halter.","Yves Saint Laurent has a special place in my heart because he was my mother's favorite designer.","We're expanding 'Ebony' and 'Jet' on the digital side to attract and maintain a younger audience.","You should never walk out of the house and not feel good about you.","I went to USC in L.A. Part of me is a real West Coast kid. My parents had a house in Palm Springs, which I now have. I spend a lot of time there.","I'm an outgoing person. Once my parents passed away, it was just my daughter and myself. So, really, my friends are my family."],"Linda Kozlowski":["After 'Crocodile Dundee,' I turned down lots of stuff, most of it where I'd play the girlfriend of some funny man.","I've never had to do anything I didn't believe in. Sometimes that meant being poor and waitressing a while longer, but I've always stuck with it.","Crocodiles are really bold, and they do come up on land."],"Linda Lael Miller":["No matter how well a person writes, a successful book is a team effort involving many, many people.","I'm awake as soon as the sun crests the eastern hills. I guess I'm motivated because I love just about everything about my life - the writing, the many critters, the art, and all the rest.","I've loved all my books, but I will admit that 'The Man from Stone Creek' holds a very special place in my heart.","I was once a single mother, with very few resources, so I have a special place in my heart for women in difficult situations.","'Big Sky Mountain' is the story of Hutch Carmody and Kendra Shepherd, lovers with a history, and a lot of hurt pride. The book is about finding their way back to each other, growing as people, and inventing a life they can share.","I love writing Christmas stories, especially of the historical variety.","I think we all like to get away from our troubles and worries with a good book.","I've written since I was 10 years old, so I guess I'm self-taught. I've had some luck along the way, I must admit, and I've worked hard."],"Linda Lavin":["The story about me, apocryphal or not, is that I could sing before I spoke. My parents went into bedroom one day and there I was standing in the crib singing God Bless America.","It was always acting, singing and dancing that I loved.","I'd forget the piece just before I went out to do the concerto, the panic was too great. This was not anything that gave me pleasure. This was fulfilling somebody else's dream.","My mother gave me singing lessons; that was totally painful, because I couldn't do what she wanted to hear. She used to say: there's more there, there's more voice but I just didn't want to give it to her.","I didn't want to do anything my mother wanted me to do so surely I wasn't going to sing for her.","Talking about auditions, you never know what anyone else is thinking.","So I majored in Drama, did all the plays that were possible to do, skated through school in order to be in every production on stage or backstage in whatever capacity and I came to New York looking for work in the summers.","Rose was sexy. It was my fantasy about her. She accomplished so much and came from so little in terms of a background that would have prepared her for the world, let alone the world of entertainment.","Once you have the pattern of life of this person, the choreography, so to speak, you have the canvas that you present eight times a week, not without feeling underneath it, but it's not as churning as the discovery process was.","We give you this story. It is for the audience to be moved and gut wrenched, not us. It isn't as if we don't go through those real feeling and it isn't as if I don't cry three or four times a night. I usually do.","We do a lot of shows for young people who have probably never been to the theater before and they are learning about the Holocaust, which unhappily, many of them do not know about.","The play is one of the very few pieces of great dramatic and comic writing that I have read in a long, long time. I was drawn to it because of the power of the writing, which gives me the actor a chance to explore many facets of myself.","Making a film of a work you've played for six weeks gives you intimate knowledge of the character. By the time you go in front of the camera you've worked out the behavior and life of a character."],"Linda Lingle":["We have come dangerously close to accepting the homeless situation as a problem that we just can't solve.","Politicians all too often think about the next election. Statesmen think about the next generation.","Good schools, good jobs, good government. These are not unreasonable demands. But sadly, some of our people have already lost heart and have left Hawaii to look for these things elsewhere.","Chronically homeless means constantly homeless; it means repeatedly homeless.","Electing pro-choice Republican women can help foster a discussion that reflects the full spectrum of views and can lead to a more balanced and responsible public dialogue.","But before looking to the future, let's glance back at the road we've traveled these past two years because that is the source of much of the optimism we are all feeling about the future.","I'm not an education expert, and frankly I don't want to make education decisions for our state. But I am experienced at successfully managing organizations, and putting people on a path where they can succeed.","I truly believe the brightest days lie ahead for the Great State of Hawaii.","Throughout my political career, I've believed in the concept of home rule. Some call it local control. Whichever phrase you use, the concept is the same - the best decisions are those made closest to those who will be impacted by the decisions.","It pains me deeply to see members of my own party attempting to legislate women's health and contraception choices.","When people are worried about the future, they don't take trips to Hawaii."],"Linda M. Godwin":["It's very important to know that we packed it right because it is a safety issue for coming home.","Although I know a lot of the previous shuttle flights, in theory, had their tasks laid out; but there were still some changes that came along for them.","I grew up watching a lot of the coverage of the early U.S. space program, all the way back starting with Mercury and then through Gemini and Apollo and of course going to the moon as the main part of the Apollo program.","A lot of these things will fly in later forms on the space station themselves, or a later form of that research will, once they kind of find out some of the basics from flying it on shuttle.","As always, we prepare for all sorts of contingencies. And the first few days of the flight up until docking on Day 3 are all spent really in the rendezvous because we launch at a time that puts us in an optimal position to catch up to station.","I did grow up with a really big interest in math and science; I liked it.","I'll be the person using the shuttle robotic arm.","In the Astronaut Office we're never totally out of training, we always keep our hand in it. But after five years, things have changed and so it's been good to get back into the flow and relearn a lot of things.","It definitely helps to have been through the arm training flow before and to have used the arm on orbit, and it also gives me the confidence to know that our training facilities are really good, that when you get up there, you feel like you've been there.","It is a very busy mission: every day has some major goals that we have to get through, but my experience before has been that at least in the evening, you kind of take a deep breath and look around where you are and have some downtime.","It's really a good feeling to know that we put this up there, that it's working, that all these people's plans that worked so hard came together and things fit and we've got a real space station.","It's really kind of a challenge to keep coordinated with the two station crews that we'll be interacting with. And of course one of them launched quite some time before our mission.","Our shuttle crew is four people, because we're going to transfer a crew up to station, so all the jobs are divided between four people rather than five or six people. So it's been busy.","The training comes to us with the benefit of what has gone before.","There's a lot of interest from the medical community on how things develop in microgravity, and the hope, later, that is expected to apply to what the changes are in humans as well.","UF is Utilization Flight. That got put in the manifest quite some time ago.","We didn't use the shuttle robot arm before, so this has been a training flow to get ready for that.","We launch when we're kind of in the same orbit that they are in terms of being matched up in inclination in space, and we're just in a little different altitude.","We still have a lot of international partner modules that need to get up there to make it truly the international structure that it will be, and that's highly important; we need to get to where the crew size is bigger.","We're on the same radius from the Earth, and then we start to swing around to where we're ahead of them on the velocity vector, so we come in relative to the station from this forward velocity position and dock on to the forward end of the Lab.","We're taking up some science experiments, some crystal growth things, we have a refrigerator that carries up some samples, new samples that go into the station, we bring the old ones home; we have a lot of clothing, we have a lot of food-U.S. and Russian food."],"Linda McCartney":["I would travel only by horse, if I had the choice.","I think hard drugs are disgusting. But I must say, I think marijuana is pretty lightweight.","I had daydreams and fantasies when I was growing up. I always wanted to live in a log cabin at the foot of a mountain. I would ride my horse to town and pick up provisions. Then return to the cabin, with a big open fire, a record player and peace.","We spent last night listening to Liverpool football team on the radio, wanting them to win so badly. Paul supports Liverpool. He was Everton for a while because of his family - but it's all Liverpool now.","We think we want to do something and when it comes to it, we don't. We don't like to commit.","If slaughterhouses had glass walls the whole world would be vegetarian.","I would like them all to enjoy life and try different things until there is something they really like.","I don't need a lot of money. Simplicity is the answer for me.","We spend so much time together, because that's how we like it. I never used to go on girl's nights out, even at school. And Paul has never liked going out for a night with the boys, either.","My mother was killed in a plane crash, so I hate travelling in planes. Death is so unexpected. I would actually rather stay at home and not go anywhere.","But I wanted marriage for myself. I was not calculating about it. I wish I was more calculating.","We are really on top of one another at the moment and I think it is amazing how we stay so close. Maybe that's the test. Why not totally put yourself together, rather than always wonder whether you actually like each other?","Cooking for six people every day is like having a cafe.","He is a terrible planner, though. So am I.","He is not in the least arrogant. The last album was written in a room in Sussex. He was like a mad professor, spending all day writing and then coming out with brilliant tunes.","I wasn't looking for another marriage. I had been married before. He is a nice man - a geologist, an Ernest Hemingway type. But Paul and I married because of convention.","I won't be having any more kids, though. Four is enough.","Paul persuaded me to join the band. I would never have had the courage otherwise. It was fun at the beginning. We were playing just for fun, with Paul's group.","We both came from families in which parents got married, had children and the whole thing. So we were not the kind of people to live together permanently.","We have lasted this long close together, so we must have something going for each other.","We moved there a year ago, just as a weekend place. Then we decided to move out of London completely. We will eventually have to work it out a bit more, because you can't have a little boy living with his sisters like that, can you? But we like the idea of closeness.","When I first toured with Wings things that were said about me were true - I did sing out of tune.","When I married Paul, we lived in St John's Wood in London. We had nice next-door neighbours, but you don't know anyone else. Everyone lives in isolation.","When Paul was arrested in Japan for having hash in his luggage, I thought he'd be out that night. But it became really serious stuff when he was kept in a cell. I became more fearful as the days went by."],"Linda McMahon":["Small business people are people with goals and values that can't be calculated on a profit and loss statement.","Optimism is the ultimate definition of a leader. A leader has to look optimistically at what is ahead while not ignoring the challenges that must be overcome. Those challenges are in government, politics, world leadership, and even in community life.","It is past time for Democrats and Republicans to join together to create a bipartisan coalition for courage and common sense.","Like all small-business owners, I know what it's like to take a risk on an idea, manage cash flow, navigate regulations and tax laws, and create jobs.","You have to think about the WWE as soap operas.","I was my father's son and my mother's daughter. There was never any time when I felt I wasn't equally capable - whether it was being the only girl in the county who could hit a jump shot in basketball or playing first base in the baseball with the boys. I was always encouraged to do whatever I wanted to do.","I think it's high time that we had a woman president. But I don't want to elect someone just because she's a woman; I want the best candidate to be elected. I think that any woman who is elected to the highest office in the land would clearly have positive role model effects for other young women.","You cant be afraid to take a risk. You can't be afraid to take a risk because you think you might fail.","As a CEO, I want to show women that there are no limits to what they can achieve, whether through entrepreneurship, government, science or any path they choose, and there is plenty of room for women at the top.","I think women are not as hung up on the testosterone thing. They're more collaborative. They multitask better, and I think they're more results-oriented. They just want to cut to the chase and get it done.","I've made a payroll. I know what it's like to execute a business plan. I know what it's like to expect the proper return on investment... and I know you can't spend your way out of debt.","I have kids in high school that don't know how to balance a checkbook. We need to have that fundamental understanding of economics as we move forward to develop the next generation of young people.","My number one philosophy for leadership is leadership by example. If you are not willing to do it yourself, how can you show others how to do it?","It's unfortunate, you know, that you can't change people's - habits, their personal habits.","While they're in WWE, we absolutely have a health and wellness policy. I'll probably always say 'we,' even though I've resigned as the CEO. It's kind of hard to break a 30-year habit.","I don't know Gov. Palin. I've certainly seen her, since she came on the scene, you know, running with John McCain.","You know, the state of Connecticut is... sometimes it's a provincial state. And I've been working very hard to get the endorsement of the people within our state, and ultimately, the ultimate endorsement is from the voters in the state of Connecticut.","I'm not going to take any special interest money or any PAC money... when I get to Washington I want to be the voice for the people of Connecticut and not owe special favors.","I'm going to continue to talk about what is important to the people of Connecticut which is jobs, getting people back to work, the economy.","I have said from the beginning, I would spend what it would take for the people of Connecticut to know who I am and what I stand for.","I certainly think you could look at the business side of how WWE was run, which was as a conservative company with little debt and strong cash balance.","It was acting, and WWE is the longest-running weekly episodic program in television. Sure, there are story lines that are better than others.","I thought I was answering a question that I had heard that was about increasing the minimum wage - would I consider that. So let me just go on record and say this: I am not for decreasing the minimum wage. I did not say that and that is not something I would consider.","The minimum wage now in our country, I think we've set that, so there are a lot of people have benefited from it in our country, but I think we ought to review how much it ought to be, and whether or not we ought to have increases in the minimum wage.","I never really thought about the fact that there weren't female role models, because I had them in my life. The women I knew in my life were so strong.","Someone asked me recently if marriage is 50-50 - it averages out to be 50-50, but sometimes it's 75-25, sometimes it's 90-10. In the end, it has to average out to be 50-50; that's how you support each other.","My parents' greatest wish was that I graduated from college. Neither of my parents had a college education, and they really wanted me to have one.","I found when talking with many other women that they sometimes are more reluctant to toot their own horn, to talk about their success. They have to be more confident in doing that. That is not always the case, but there is that element that women don't put forth who they are.","I was a tomboy. And one of my first recollections of great success was playing baseball with the boys.","You have to have a work ethic. It is always 24/7. It is a lot of sweat equity, and it is a little bit of Lady Luck.","We went bankrupt one time and lost everything. When I tell that story at my Women's Leadership LIVE conferences, people are shocked. I mean, our house was auctioned off and the car repossessed in the driveway. We had to start over again.","When I was asked if I supported merging SBA into Commerce, I really wasn't focused on SBA or Commerce; I was focused on the concept of merging agencies, or reducing duplicative programs, so that we could reduce those costs. I am a firm believer that SBA needs to be a stand-alone agency.","Truly landmark pieces of legislation - including the Social Security Act, Medicare, and the Kennedy and Reagan tax reductions - historically have garnered strong support from both parties. The ACA did not.","Without truth, trust is lost. The ACA could not have been passed were it not for the repeated assertions, which proved to be false, that Americans who liked their health plans and their doctors could keep them.","WWE is a company that produces fiction. It's a soap opera that runs 52 weeks a year without reruns.","It always is a battle for a Republican in Connecticut, even one who's a moderate like I am, and one who's an independent thinker.","Being under the political spotlight is far different than anything I'd experienced before. Every word is a critical word. Sometimes you really aren't allowed to get your full thought out. A lot of it is about having a 30-second sound bite.","I wasn't looking for a hobby. If I were looking for a hobby, it wouldn't be the United States Senate. That's one of the toughest jobs I'd probably ever do. I just felt there wasn't enough compromise going on: People were too far to the left, too far to the right, with no one trying to build a compromise.","The small businesses that I've talked to have consistently said that the cost of health care is one of the things that they need the most help with.","Let me just go on record and say this: I am not for decreasing the minimum wage.","I remember the early days when every month I had to decide whether I should continue to lease a typewriter or if I could finally afford to buy it. Yes, that $12 a month really made a difference in our budget.","I like to tell small business owners and entrepreneurs, 'I get it. I have your back on this. I understand about regulation. I understand how taxes are taxing. I understand what it is like not to be able to borrow money when you need it.'","We want to create more jobs. We want to qualify more lenders and expand lending markets. But also, I want a very different SBA - it's not your father's SBA. I want to modernize it and reposition it so when people think about jobs, they think about how the Small Business Administration would really be helpful.","More entrepreneurs are looking to come back to start businesses, and that is where SBA is perfectly positioned to be helping more people to realize their dreams.","Even entrepreneurs with the best ideas sometimes need a little wind beneath their wings.","I have learned it's not how you fall but how you get up that truly matters."],"Linda Perry":["I want to be perceived - or maybe I perceive myself - as this really easygoing, honest person that's just giving. Realistically, I have those qualities, but I'm very aggressive. I can be very harsh. It comes off almost mean, you know?","For me, Heaven is evoking emotions through sound.","Food is supposed to be vibrant, fresh, filled with color.","I'm able to switch gears at any moment.","You kind of have to have no ego to be a producer and a songwriter.","I don't think I could make a pop album.","I have a lot of songs that I kind of put away, and I don't let anybody else hear them, and those are my songs.","I'm a horrible producer when it comes to me, but for other artists, I don't know what it is, but something happens, and I'm just really good at it.","I think women gravitate toward me because I am a woman producing and songwriting, and there's none out there. There really isn't.","I usually write songs in a guy key because my voice is so husky.","I didn't like being out in the limelight. I love performing, but that's it.","My number one goal is to take over the music business and run a really great record company.","People are gonna get tired of Linda Perry the producer, but I will always be in the music business. And I will always be successful in it.","I nurture people's talents because, at the end of it, that's what they're left with. They're left with themselves.","I don't think I'm the world's greatest producer or songwriter or anything.","I told my mom I was gay when I was 16, and my mom said with her heavy Brazilian accent, 'OK, but at least look good at it.'","I'm 44, and I've never had a problem being gay, and maybe I dodged a lot of bullets, and maybe I'm one of the lucky ones. I want to make sure every kid can have that experience.","I did love 'What's Up?' but I hated the production.","I want to show people my interpretation of what creating music is, and this is where it comes from: the heart.","I feel that when I listen to music - not that it's bad - it's not emotional. It has a gimmick to it. It's selling something: the artist, the producer, something. The emotional capacity is very small, for the listener as well.","Pink is an extremely secure person. She knows who she is. When she's going to make a change, she's going to make the change. She just needs someone to help her with the vision.","Music comes from inside. It's not a style. It's just passion.","When making any record, a producer has a list of things you hope an artist brings to the studio. Songs that are strong even without the bells and whistles.","I don't want to be a rock star. I had my 15 minutes of fame.","I'm overcritical, insensitive, and pushy when it comes to me. With everybody else, I'm a great listener, and all I want is for them to be happy.","I'm really good at bringing out greatness - in anybody. I don't even have to be in the studio. What a gift to be able to help people bring out the best qualities in them.","I have to meet everybody I work with before I work with them. Before I say yes, I have to meet them, and then I take it from there. I don't care if you've had the best record or the worst. That doesn't matter to me. I don't care about that stuff.","For me, to have had an impact with anything that you've done, whether it's a painting, a photo, a poem, or something that you've created, just that experience is enormous. You don't get that all the time.","I've had many songs where I've gone, 'Oh, my God, this song is going to be huge!' but it wasn't the right artist, or something just didn't happen. It didn't make the song any worse. It just didn't line up. That does happen.","My process of songwriting comes from a very real place: a place that when you watch 'American Idol' - God bless it, it's probably an awesome experience that these people are having, but it's not a real one.","You create something in your bedroom or your house, and it's just a fun thing that you're doing. Then, all of a sudden, you hear that song that you started in your house, and it's on the radio. And people are now acknowledging it. It's just trippy. What a life.","I've been touching instruments since the day I was born. My mother is Brazilian, and she listens to Brazilian music. My father was a musician, and I've seen pictures of him when he was in a band playing guitar and piano. He loved country music, Frank Sinatra, and stuff like that.","I don't read music. I refuse to learn how to do that. I barely know half the chords I'm playing. I like being naive when it comes to that.","In no way am I a spiritual person. I'm not some guru geek.","I'm extremely hard to work with.","The L.A. Gay & Lesbian Center has this wonderful program where they take in the youth, feed them, help them learn how to cook, clean, they help them get jobs, help them learn how to save their money, and they have shelters all over the city.","'American Idol' is a machine. It's a machine that's making a lot of money, that's selling a lot of product. It's 'American Marketing.'","I'm a songwriter, an artist, and a musician. I do not have to try to be that; I just am.","There's a lot of artists that are celebrities, not really artists.","You need a big team to support a career.","I'm just in tune to myself and what I need from the universe.","I'm great at working with people and collaborating. And if my biggest gift of all is that I'm really good at pulling things from people and helping them become better at what they're doing, I'm here, as I believe all of us are, to be of service.","I want to be so giving and collaborative, but my best songs were written on my own.","I love Pink, and I love Christina Aguilera. Something about Christina always inspires me to do things that are really different.","I want to be a producer and not a songwriter.","I would love for Radiohead to give me a call and say, 'Hey, kid, we wanna see what it's like working with you. We want you to produce our next record.'","I love just helping people; that's what I'm good at.","I was raised in a time when parents brought out belts, and you got tough love.","We're married. We are one now. There's no running away. We have to deal with things together and figure them out, and that's the greatest gift. I'm in it. People ask me, 'How do you maintain a relationship?' I don't know, but all I do know is that I chose Sara to be the one, and when I choose something, that's all that matters, and I'm totally in.","I don't ever get too literal.","I'm not a children's songwriter. I'm not in that world.","A lot of people call me a 'machine,' and I don't think a lot of men or women operate the way I do.","It's not a 'sexy' position, being the producer. You have to be very bossy. You have to be very aggressive.","Rick Rubin's amazing, by the way. I just need to say that.","If you're not confident, people push you around. That's it. It's super-simple.","Rock & roll doesn't belong on a grid. It belongs on a pulse - a natural pulse.","Record companies don't think creatively about what something could possibly be because they are not filled with creative people. Nobody's looking at the future of music because they're concentrating so hard on what they can get from it right this second. It's really hard to see an artist; it's a lot easier to see money.","I just love music. I love writing songs. It's not even a job; it's a gift. I'm waiting for someone to kick me out of the party because I snuck in here, and I keep thinking somebody's going to figure out that I have no clue. Turns out that most of them have even less of a clue.","My family, they are definitely not an ordinary family.","I wanted to go back to writing for myself and my fans. I built my own recording studio, started my own label, and decided to use the Internet to sell my records.","I love being home. I play with my dogs.","If you want to be famous, you can.","To give is one of the greatest gifts one could ever receive.","People come to me to write songs that will be successful for them, and they allow me the freedom to do so.","I was scared of failure, of being a one-hit wonder, never being able to write another song again, never being able to sing again. Maybe everything that I think I am and who I want to be never will happen.","I get to do all the styles of music that I love. There's no boundaries; there's nobody holding on to me saying I can't do that.","I don't feel the need to be in the spotlight whatsoever.","I'm a fast learner, and I believe in change, and I believe in growing, and I believe in moving forward and not staying in the same place.","One day, it hit me that music is my calling. I just started playing and writing music. How, I don't know. I just started doing it, and then this big voice came out of my mouth. And it felt like I was releasing something.","To me, I feel like everything I touch will do good. Because my heart and my passion is all in the right spot. And you can't go wrong with that. But maybe I'm naive.","I don't care if I go broke. I don't care about all that stuff. I just want to know that I did everything I wanted to do.","Sometimes I'll look back at old pictures where I'm a little heavy and dressed funny and think, 'How did I get chicks all the time?'","It'll never get old to hear a song that I wrote on the radio or to hear what someone experienced when they heard a song I wrote.","It's a humbling and amazing journey when you write a song in your bedroom, and you've got no money, and you're trying to write a song based on where you're at right at this moment.","I've lived out in a park sleeping on the grass with no place to go; I've not eaten. I've been there.","There's nothing you could do to me, nothing you could take away from me that would make me feel like I wasn't going to be all right.","I love writing songs, but I don't want to write the songs everyone else is asking me to write."],"Linda Ronstadt":["There should not be a question of legal or illegal immigration. People came and immigrated to this country from the time of the Indians. No one's illegal. They should just be able to come.","The only reason to be with somebody is that they make you a better person and you make them a better person.","I admire people's marriages, and I think it's a wonderful thing to have, but I don't think it's the only way to live. I think there are many ways to live and many ways to establish intimate support in your life that can be from family or friends or great roommates that you like.","I am a believer in discipline; it takes a lot to do well. You need discipline for those little excursions into the chaotic that make life interesting.","Having children makes you see the world in a completely different way. When you're responsible for those little lives, you can't slough it off or forget about it until later.","Songwriting wasn't my gift. I think you have to cultivate a gift; you have to practice and develop craft around your gift so that you can execute it in more convenient, efficient ways.","I had a galvanised voice: I could sing through a 105 fever or a flu or a root canal or anything that you could throw at me.","The thing you have to be prepared for is that other people don't always dream your dream.","I didn't know why I couldn't sing - all I knew was that it was muscular or mechanical. Then, when I was diagnosed with Parkinson's, I was finally given the reason. I now understand that no one can sing with Parkinson's disease. No matter how hard you try. And in my case, I can't sing a note.","In the United States, we spend millions of dollars on sports because it promotes teamwork, discipline, and the experience of learning to make great progress in small increments. Learning to play music does all this and more.","I grew up in Arizona. I love it. I'm a part of the desert. I feel like, really, I'm from the Sonoran Desert, which is - extends to both sides of the border. I'm really from that part of Mexico, also. And I hate that there's a fence, you know, running through it.","I know my own father's business was very dependent on the goodwill and business and trade from people in northern Mexico. We knew their families and went to their weddings and baptisms and balls and picnics, and we had a great time with them.","The thing I like about singing duets is that I get things out of my voice I never get singing by myself.","Art is for healing ourselves, and everybody needs their own personal art to heal up their problems.","In the Troubadour days, it was all those songwriters that I hung around with all the time, so I could get songs and find out what was going on. So we all knew each other, and we just carried each other's word around.","I miss singing every day. I can't sing anymore. My voice doesn't work. I have Parkinson's disease, and it sometimes takes my words away from me.","I had a lot of chances to do things that other people don't ever get, and I have to be content with that. I have to look around for some other way to make myself useful.","It's a real conflict for me when I go to a concert and find out somebody in the audience is a Republican or fundamental Christian. It can cloud my enjoyment. I'd rather not know.","I wish I had as much in bed as I get in the newspapers.","I don't think you can look for love. All you can do is get yourself in a situation where you don't discourage something that may be rather nice.","The constant fear of a performer is to become what is reflected back at you.","Everywhere you go, there's a soundtrack. You can't really quite hear it. It's just a little out of the range of hearing.","I'd go over to my grandmother's house, and she'd be playing opera. They loved opera. Not only did they play it on the radio, but they played it on their piano. Everybody learned how to read music and how to play.","The whole thing with recording is you have to know when to turn off the tape machine and just stop recording because you want to keep fixing, fixing, fixing, you know?","I always thought competition was for horse races and it never belonged in art. I never felt that competitive with other girl singers, really.","Men are very delicate. They don't like being rejected.","Parkinson's is very hard to diagnose. So when I finally went to a neurologist, and he said, 'Oh, you have Parkinson's disease,' I was completely shocked.","I used to feel kind of impatient with people who couldn't do things fast or couldn't remember stuff.","I didn't love Jim Morrison. There was something very reptilian about him. And I didn't care for his singing, but his band! The Doors were fantastic.","I can't really walk well. The muscles don't get the electronic signals from my brain, not that there's anything wrong with the muscles themselves. It's just my brain.","You have the United States, and you have Mexico, and then you have this Mexican-American thing which is this third culture, which I like to call Aztlan.","I listen mostly to live music, and mostly my musical experience was playing music with other people.","As I got older, I got Parkinson's disease, so I couldn't sing at all. That's what happened to me. I was singing at my best strength when I developed Parkinson's. I think I've had it for quite a while.","Ninety-eight percent of the singing I did was private singing - it was in the shower, at the dishwasher, driving my car, singing with the radio, whatever. I can't do any of that now. I wish I could. I don't miss performing, particularly, but I miss singing.","Full disclosure here - I had a terrible crush on Smokey Robinson, like every other female on the planet.","I'm a chameleon. I can change my voice a lot. I always was able to, because in my family's music, I was a harmony singer, and harmony singing is really hard.","Ninety-nine percent of singing is listening and hearing, and so then 1 percent of it is singing.","I'm your basic atheist that believes in maybe - I'm a spiritual atheist.","I love everything soft, cashmere and down. I don't like anything scratchy.","The smell of the carpet in a hotel room is the same everywhere.","Sometimes I was frivolous. Did you have some frivolous years? I had to live mine out in public.","I got a couple of different contacts from publishing companies saying they'd be interested in a book about my work: not a kiss-and-tell book, which I specifically put in the contract. Just a book about my work and what I did.","I got to sing with Placido Domingo... I got to sing with Aaron Neville, who is one of my favorites. Got to sing with Brian Wilson, one of the great high tenors. And Ricky Skaggs, a bluegrass tenor. I'm also proud of my musical friendship with Emmylou Harris.","For years, I've been interviewed, and they write what they thought I thought or what they thought I said. Sometimes it's accurate, and often it isn't.","I always sang harmony with my family growing up.","I grew up in a big sky country. Then I lived in Manhattan, where you can only see the sky between buildings, and then I went into a building where you couldn't see the sky at all. I didn't like that so much.","I wanted to sing when I was little. That's what I liked doing. It didn't occur to me that you became famous or anything like that.","The music that I chose during my life, it wasn't arbitrary. It was all in my family home when I was growing up. I never tried to record anything I hadn't heard before the age of 10. Otherwise, I couldn't do it authentically.","I always say if music can't make you cry, you're a hopeless case. I don't cry very much myself, but it's my job to make you cry.","Singing with Aaron Neville, he pulled stuff out of my voice I never could have gotten, because if he's providing XYZ, I have to put in ABC, and usually I don't have to put in ABC.","To sing with Frank Sinatra in any capacity at all is overwhelming.","I never thought of myself as a rock singer. I was interested in songs like 'Heart Like a Wheel,' and I liked the others for about 15 minutes.","I can remember sitting at the piano. My sister was playing, and my brother was singing something, and I said, 'I want to try that.'","I didn't think I was a famous singer. I didn't think I was a star or that I could make the waters part - just that singing was what I was going to do.","You don't want people who have never had to deal with adversity - you want people who have been able to deal successfully with adversity. That's what adds to society. Those are going to be the hardest-working, best people.","I've been lucky in my life to work with people who I consider master singers.","You don't forget you have Parkinson's disease, believe me, especially in the shower. If you are not paying attention, you fall down.","I've never been happy with the quality of my work. I always felt as though my musicianship was lacking and that I should have worked harder at it when I was younger. As I sang and sang, I improved.","People have often written about me, that I did this for this reason and that for that reason, and they're usually 98 percent wrong.","I used to live with J.D. Souther, and I would watch him write. He's be sitting, he'd say something, and then he'd write it down. That's craft.","I'll occasionally go and do an honor like the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund because it raises money for a very worthy organization."],"Linda Sanchez":["For too long, our society has shrugged off bullying by labeling it a 'rite of passage' and by asking students to simply 'get over it.' Those attitudes need to change. Every day, students are bullied into silence and are afraid to speak up. Let's break this silence and end school bullying.","When so-called child's play turns hostile, and a child becomes a victim, it is time to act. Victims of cyberbullying do not choose to participate. Rather than build character, bullying can cause children to become anxious, fearful, unhappy, and even cause them to be physically sick.","I've used my experience from playing sports in almost every aspect of my life. Playing soccer is where I found my voice, and playing softball was where I learned precision, and in every game I learned to play as a member of a team - to work not for my own glory, but for a shared goal.","I have to tell you, I live paycheck to paycheck like most Americans. It's very difficult for me to say, 'Hey, I can give up my paycheck,' because the reality is, I have financial obligations that I have to meet on a month-to-month basis that doesn't make it possible for me.","Latinos are concerned about the same pocketbook issues that matter to most middle class Americans - creating good-paying jobs in this country, making sure our children get a quality education, and ensuring that our families have access to affordable and quality healthcare.","You can't be the perfect member of Congress and the perfect mother 100 percent of the time. And probably, you'd be a pretty annoying person if you were.","I feel sometimes that there's this sense that people are poor because they want to be, or they're working-class because they want to be or because they don't work hard enough. I feel like there's this demonization of working people in general, but specifically definitely labor union members.","I am a big proponent of adopting dogs through shelters and rescue operations. Having dogs in the office might not be right for everyone, but it has certainly worked well for me. My advice to other offices, on the Hill and off, would be to try it out.","As a member of Congress, I'm often reminded that in baseball, as in diplomacy, you have to know when to hit, when to run, and when to show grace.","Gender equality cannot be achieved by cutting programs that allow girls to get the same chance to compete, learn, and play. The United States has had a solid history of commitment to its female athletes and expanding opportunity for women, and it is imperative that we continue on this path.","Latinas are the fastest growing segment of the minority population, and their perspective deserves to be represented, not denigrated.","Congresswomen are congresswomen - you are, sorry. And for women who want to be congressmen, there's a screw loose in their head. I'm proud of being a woman. I think 'congresswoman' is the appropriate term, and 'Madame chair' is just fine with me.","I think most Americans would agree that we need sensible solutions that fix our immigration system and deal humanely with aspiring citizens currently in our country. At the same time, these solutions must increase the security of our borders.","A lot about Congress is about forming good working relationships with people, and humor can really help you do that.","At the end of the day I'm just Linda, and Linda is a single professional woman, and a lot of women can relate to what I talk about.","Getting guns off the streets does make communities safer. We can't stand here and say because we don't have the perfect solution, we shouldn't try."],"Linda Sue Park":["When I was reading books for 'Seesaw Girl,' I came across several references to the fact that in the 11th and 12th centuries, Korean pottery was considered the finest in the world. I liked that - the idea of a little tiny country being the best at something.","What I like most: Reading well-written sources that take me to another world for hours at a time - and being able to call that 'work!' Also, of course, finding a gem of information that is either exactly what I was looking for, or else fits perfectly into the story in some way.","With a book called 'Keeping Score,' I really did want to write a book about the Korean War, because I felt that it is the least understood war in the American cultural imagination. So I set out with the idea that Americans didn't know much about the Korean War and that I was going to try to fix a tiny bit of that.","God bless Interlibrary Loan. I pay a lot of library fines. In the case of 'A Single Shard,' I was using books that hadn't been checked out in 30 years, so I didn't feel too bad.","I used to sit home with my computer and write. After the Newbery, I probably spend more than half my time on the road.","I've been writing for as long as I can remember, and reading even before that. My mom still has stories that I wrote when I was in kindergarten. I was a reader and a re-reader. That's the main reason I became a writer.","My first publication was a haiku in a children's magazine when I was 9 years old. I received one dollar for it! I gave the check to my dad for Christmas, and he framed it and hung it over his desk.","After high school, I went to Stanford University and majored in English. Of course, that gave me a chance to do lots more reading and writing. I also received degrees in London and Dublin - where I moved to be near a charming Irishman who became my husband!","I can give advice to anyone interested in writing in one word: Read! I think it's much more important to be a reader than to be a writer!","When I'm writing, I try not to think things like, 'Gosh, I have to finish writing this book.' Books are very long and it's easy to get discouraged. Instead I think to myself, 'Wow, I have this great story idea, and today I'm going to write two pages of it. That's all - just two pages.'","All my books take a long time to research. I spend several months researching before I start writing, and in the middle of writing I often have to stop and look up stuff. At my local library, I am one of the best customers! The research takes several months.","Each of my books has taken me a different length of time to write - eight months for 'Seesaw Girl,' eight months for 'Shard,' three years for 'When My Name Was Keoko!' The publisher takes another year and a half to work on the book, so altogether each book can take up to three or four years to publish.","I often have trouble falling asleep at night, so when I'm lying in bed I think up stories. That's where I do a lot of my thinking. I also get a lot of ideas while I'm reading - sometimes reading someone else's stories will make me think of one of my own.","I want all my books to provoke some kind of response in the reader, to make them think something or feel something or both, and for that to become a part of them and work into their own lives.","I do think that part of literature's job is to comment on and participate in the social issues of the time.","In my family and among Korean-Americans, there just is no occasion that people would get together without bibimbap. It's something that people eat when they're wanting to celebrate or have a good time with friends.","Most writers adore their editors, and I'm no exception.","If you're trying to write about very strong horror, very strong fear or very strong emotion, it's easy to overwrite it.","I enjoy my family a lot. I have active teenagers, and they're in soccer and choral events."],"Linda Thompson":["Our uniqueness, our individuality, and our life experience molds us into fascinating beings. I hope we can embrace that. I pray we may all challenge ourselves to delve into the deepest resources of our hearts to cultivate an atmosphere of understanding, acceptance, tolerance, and compassion. We are all in this life together.","Being transgender, like being gay, tall, short, white, black, male, or female, is another part of the human condition that makes each individual unique, and something over which we have no control. We are who we are in the deepest recesses of our minds, hearts and identities.","Just try to do the right thing, and that's immediate karma: 'I feel good about myself.'","We only do harm to ourselves when we harbor resentment and vitriol toward another. I do believe that everything is forgivable; some things are inexcusable but forgivable.","People get a little sidelined thinking that fame and fortune is going to bring them happiness, peace and contentment in their lives. Everyone thinks they want to be famous until the paparazzi are in their face, and then they're asking, 'Just give me some privacy.'","I have fabulous sons, but unfortunately, they both have that thrill-seeker gene - bigger, higher, faster, scarier. I have a deal with God. If I'm breathing, that's a prayer for my sons' safety.","I think we do people a great disservice by putting them on a pedestal and not allowing them to be human.","I thought I knew what love was before giving birth to my baby, but whatever I had experienced in the past paled in comparison to the utterly unconditional love I immediately felt for the little bundle I now held in my arms.","As life has a way of unfolding as it is meant to, I have learned to trust life.","The Bruce I knew back then was an easygoing, down-to-earth, casual, romantic, good and loving man. I was extremely happy to have found such a remarkable partner with whom to share my life.","Elvis was sincere, and he was - he was so loyal. And he was so homespun. He loved his mother, he loved America. You know, he loved his fellow man. He had a great humanitarian philanthropic sense.","There has been speculation through the years that Elvis has his eyes done or some other mystery procedure, but that mini facelift was the extent of his plastic surgery.","When Elvis came out on stage, it became electric. And the way people responded to him was such that, you know, I never saw that kind of response toward any other performer.","I have four chickens. I have four laying hens. And I have 50 fruit trees. I make apricot and plum jam every summer. I brought Memphis to Malibu.","I never felt more loved than when I was with Elvis.","Why did I break up with Elvis? It was difficult to watch his slow demise.","Honestly, I was so happy for Bruce because I loved Bruce... and Bruce felt like my brother. You know, I wanted him to be OK, and I was just thrilled he'd found someone who had four children and someone who understood what it was like to be a parent - you know, just to have that great family life again.","Bruce was famous, but not 'Elvis famous.' He was confident and lighthearted. Comfortable in his own skin. Or so it seemed.","That's the spirit in which I went to New York to be with my husband, and when I knocked on the hotel door, she opened the door as Caitlyn as we now know her - full makeup and fully dressed as a woman. So it was devastating to me to see because I had envisioned Bruce opening the door, but it was helpful in my process.","She didn't want to disrupt her family. She didn't want to lose her family; she didn't want to hurt her children. She struggled. It was a lifelong struggle for her, being in Bruce Jenner's body.","Caitlyn seems so much happier and freer in her feminine self.","I completely accept, respect, and support Caitlyn, but I must admit, I sometimes miss Bruce.","Bruce possessed such a natural athleticism in everything he attempted to do. He seemed to excel in every sport he tried. Whatever he did, he was daring and cut an amazing form.","For so long, I just let people surmise what they would about my life and my choices, and other people have written books and told tales."],"Linda Tripp":["People should be allowed to document evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Where is the expectation of privacy if someone is conspiring to commit crime?","Respect is not ever assigned; it's earned.","I didn't write a book. It wasn't for self-enrichment.","Where is the expectation of privacy in the commission of a crime?","I have nothing to hide.","There is no method by which an average citizen can effectively fight the White House in the media.","I had a 20-year, stellar government career.","The first tenet is that you should report corruption regardless of loyalty to incumbent or party.","Look, if America - if being an American means anything, it means not having to lie under oath, not even for the president.","I can live with myself.","My government career is over."],"Linda Vester":["I think I'd like to stay anchoring because, number one, I'm learning a lot, and I love it when I'm learning. And number two, I also have the luxury of a stable life.","Finally, I get to have houseplants and they stay alive.","What upset me the most was not that I would die, but that I was letting down my parents. I felt very guilty for chasing this dream career of mine, at the expense of my parents.","The school made it very clear that women were entitled to positions of authority. That sense of entitlement allowed us to feel that we have a natural place in leadership in the world. That gave me a mental and emotional confidence.","Sometimes stories are inherently important whether or not they have a direct relation to your life.","So now my road map has changed and I don't have a really clear idea of what the next stops are.","In my rational mind, I know... that is a very simplistic way of looking at it, but when there is violence of that kind, it challenges my faith. I still can't say that I totally understand why - why that is allowed to happen.","I didn't want my parents to support me. I wanted to prove that I could do it by myself.","But there's always a Mass. It's not a formal Mass at all. We're sitting around her dining room table with wine and Eucharist and holding hands. It's very informal and small, but to me that's a wonderful way to have Mass.","But for the first time in many years, I get to sleep in my own bed every night. I haven't done that, literally, in years. It seems like such a small thing, but it is so nice.","As a journalist, it is so easy to get hardened when you see so many stories that are disturbing. Sometimes it's just your survival mechanism that makes you hardened to some of it.","And since I just turned 32, I'm thinking about getting married, having a family, and that's very difficult to do on the road as a correspondent."],"Linda Wells":["This is such a different time, and we are such a different-sized magazine. And yes, today the average reader is older, but we have a wide span of ages. You can enter 'Allure' as a 14-year-old and read about acne, and then in your 60s you can read about face lifts and injections and everything in between.","The habits of the American consumer are changing; that's a reality.","Tom Ford once told me that he found French women sexier than American ones. He said, 'Americans are too clean...' I took no offense."],"Linden Ashby":["Only be an actor if you can't be happy doing anything else. I don't think you should be an actor if you want to be actor. I think you should be an actor if you have to be an actor.","You bring a little bit of yourself into every character you play. We're multifaceted creatures.","I started out in theater and then I got a job on a soap in New York.","I love the show 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia;' that's probably a guilty pleasure! I laugh so hard.","Why are people always shooting zombies? Why not just chop their heads off? How can zombies get you if you have a good sword?","I started out with a business and psychology major, and then I started doing plays and concentrating more and more on theater. I dropped out of college and moved to New York and studied theater at The Neighborhood Playhouse. I did that for a couple of years and then got an agent.","I started out in theater, and then I got a job on a soap in New York. With a soap opera, its every day, all year long - there's no downtime, and you're shooting a show a day.","I've done so many Lifetime movies; at this point, I'll be going through airport security, and the lady there will be like, 'I took the weekend off and I saw four of your movies.' And I say: 'You've been watching Lifetime, right?'"],"Lindi Ortega":["I'm a fan of retracing the facts and absorbing my atmosphere and being influenced by it.","The reason I moved to Nashville was because I was reading biographies of a lot of my country music heroes, and I thought it would be better to actually go where the history was, as opposed to just reading about it.","I like passion in voices. I like passion in music. And I find that, sometimes with today's music, it's just so perfect - it's that high fidelity and all of the auto-tuning and all that stuff. It's too perfect for my ears.","I'm not ashamed to admit that I've written some really bad songs and I've had some bad performances.","Certain social situations make me feel like a square peg in a round hole. Realising you can connect to the human race through song makes me feel less alien.","I love singing.","My dad was a bass player in a Latino band when I was growing up. So we always had musical instruments in our basement.","It's always my goal to raise the bar with each record I put out.","I like to work with different musicians and producers to change the feels of every release.","I have this drive to prove people wrong - people who thought I should give up or assumed I'd never get anywhere."],"Lindsay Davenport":["While I still have more good days than bad days, I'm going to keep playing.","Some times you lose more than you win. It's about handling losses and trying to turn them into positives. You get out into the big leagues and there's a period of adjustment to be made. You've got to handle it.","The return is one of the hardest shots to make when you come back from injury.","We get criticized for showing no personality, then we get penalized when we do.","I don't think I should be underestimated.","I don't enjoy being in Europe for weeks on end, so I just skip it.","I did not grow up with people, you know, pounding in my head, 'This is what you've got to do, this is what you're going to do.'","While I was always successful... I never thought I'd be one in the world.","I was never a prodigy.","I always tried to hide the fact that I was an athlete. I just wanted to be normal.","I wasn't a perfect thing at 17. I didn't have confidence. I was hunched over and real embarrassed, and I didn't want to be in the limelight. But it changed over time.","Nobody wants to go through divorce, especially when there's young children involved.","I think I'm pretty down to earth.","Tennis is more commercial these days.","You always see people coming back to the sport, and I've always thought, 'Gosh, when you're done playing, wouldn't you just want to stay at home?'","I come from a family of working women, my mum went to work two weeks after I was born - my parents had no money, there was no choice.","I could never have gotten back into my career without the undying support of my husband, who works full time at a stressful job! We decided that we were going to do this as total partners and it is a 50/50 deal with us.","In the history of women's tennis the great players have come back from long absences with no problems.","I've played too many tennis hours.","I'm not that interesting!","I never had tons of friends on tour. I was quiet and went about my business.","I couldn't imagine being from a country where all the pressure is on a particular player.","With my child, I hardly watch TV now.","I TiVo 'CSI,' 'CSI: Miami,' 'Grey's Anatomy,' 'Young and The Restless' - my husband hates that one - and that's pretty much it."],"Lindsay Duncan":["I have the highest regard for Meryl Streep as an actress and think she's a fabulous person as well.","My parents' generation was definitely pre-telly, and they knew how to entertain each other. Everybody knew something that they could do - a song or a poem, or a piece of music. At school, I remember being a cat and then a budgie and then a bumble bee. I obviously thought all that was marvelous.","I was the suburban kid of Scottish parents, and the idea of an acting career was so beyond my experience. I didn't even know there were drama schools until a friend told me.","The excitement of stepping onto a stage - there's nothing quite like it.","If someone said I had enough money and I could take six months off, I would run in an instant.","I suppose because I do and can work in the theatre, I don't see work as closing down as an older woman.","I don't have any desire to be better known.","A certain amount of anger doesn't make us less empathetic, less humane, less loving. It just makes us real.","Deep down, I think I would be utterly miserable in Hollywood.","It's an important point to make that people can't just be invalidated, eradicated, because they don't fit tidily into a box. And more and more, the modern world is all about conformity.","That kind of creaming off the pretty postcard image of the past, I think, is a road to nowhere.","I have done some wonderful television, but you know, there's not as much exceptional material as there is in the theatre. So I do a lot of theatre, but really, as with most actors, I just love going from one to another. It's stimulating, it's diverting, it's a different way of life, and you know, I dearly like a good mix.","You're not cast because you're like someone or because you're sympathetic to them. You're cast because you can act.","I would rather give up acting than become world famous, because I think you pay a very high price. Writing and putting new plays out into the world has informed what I do, and I've had a lot more freedom to play really interesting parts.","You always remember the delicacy of the work you do on a new play - the delicacy and the rigor and the courage.","I want to have the career that is my choice - what interests me, what doesn't. I feel more and more strongly about that.","I desperately wanted to play the part of Darth Vader's mother - I think she ended up being played by a Scandinavian actress - because my son was completely crazy about 'Star Wars.'","Recently I made the mistake of opening a bundle of reviews that someone had sent me of a production from years and years ago, and someone had written a really lovely review except that it made a remark about the way I spoke: 'A lot of people find her voice terribly irritating.' Do they? I had no idea.","My mother was always deeply attracted to anything medical, and I think she would have loved me to have been a doctor. My father was in the army for 21 years, came out just before I was born. There was no history of showbusiness on either side of the family, but they were completely supportive.","I know I'll always work. In what form, it really doesn't matter.","No matter how much we disagree with people, demonising them doesn't get us anywhere; it merely indicates a closed mind.","I'm perfectly gregarious, but I can also be really happy left to my own devices with nobody watching me or listening to me.","I've always had not just an affection but a real love for the theater family in New York, and I really feel it is a family. I'm so touched by the generosity of everyone there.","I loved 'Homeland' - it's such an intriguing, intelligent piece of television, and I am fascinated by them making a hero and heroine that are so odd, so flawed and so complicated. It is a programme that really draws you in.","I've been listening to a new band called Wolf Alice, courtesy of my son. The vocalist, Ellie Rowsell, has a gorgeous voice.","My background is really being a writer's actor - that seems to be the way I work best, bringing out the best of writing. There's a whole range of acting skills, and some people can be astonishing with very poor material. That's not me; my skill is essentially unlocking the writing.","I do feel almost violent when I'm watching things that I don't think are good enough. I get furious for the audience. I want to say to them, 'This play is not supposed to be like this. They've got it completely wrong. You should be electrified by this.'","I don't perform well in private. Socially, I mean. And I didn't as a child. Actors aren't necessarily outgoing, are they?","I've always been a material-based actor. That's what I've done, the choices I've made - like a heat-seeking missile."],"Lindsay Ellingson":["Growing up I always shopped at Victoria's Secret with my mom and saw Angels like Gisele and Karolina Kurkova in the windows.","It's exciting for me to be home in California where I'm from and to be working with Victoria's Secret.","Valentine's Day is my favorite holiday.","When it comes to exercise, I don't like anything that's too serious.","I've been dancing for 10 years.","Anytime someone says we're channelling 1960s, I'm like, I'm in, I love it."],"Lindsay Fox":["If you believe you can make a difference, then you will make a difference. Believe in yourself, your family and your community and you will win.","Personal relationships are always the key to good business. You can buy networking; you can't buy friendships.","Life isn't about algebra and geometry. Learning by making mistakes and not duplicating them is what life is about.","People in business generally have a responsibility to the community. They have to put back into the community from which they take. I think I've adopted that all through my life. Caring and sharing are two major fundamentals of life.","I don't think there's any real motivation for somebody to be a truck driver. Mine was simple; dad was a truck driver, I wanted to own one.","Anybody I grew up with in this area - they're still a mate. Lots of people in the Prahran area gave me my first go. Sold me my trucks on... I don't know, 100 deposit and 100 a month. Without the support of those guys, you'd still sort of be driving a truck.","If you give people peanuts, you get monkeys. So if you want good people that are highly qualified, make the amount of money available for them to go out and do the job.","I was a careless Protestant, my wife was a good Catholic, and we had six kids in seven years and I'd endorse that to everyone.","The old man sold beer after hours on weekends. And that was something that he probably did to top up his earnings as a truck driver. Mum was the traditional housewife. Loving, caring, sharing - always the keynotes of the family.","Initially, I used to cart coke from the West Melbourne Gasworks -12 tonne a day, 150-pound sacks. I'd come home looking like Al Jolson at the end of the day - white teeth, black face... A good hard day's work.","I started ice-skating when I was about 12 or 13 and I was selected in the Australian team for ice hockey. I met my wife at St Moritz Ice Skating about 1955.","Three score and, and ten has always been something that I never thought I'd make. So when I made it, I wanted to celebrate it and I did.","My father was a truck driver. That's where it all started, and academically I was a disaster at school. My cousin got his name on the honour board; I, at Melbourne High School, I carved mine on the desk.","I'd rather have a pencil and paper and do all my own calculations rather than rely on a machine. And I'll do most calculations in double digit multiples as quick as the machine.","Basically as a working class boy I understand when there's not enough money to put food on the table and not knowing where the next dollar comes in from. When you've been in that environment as a child, you never lose it.","One of the nicest things about receiving the accolade of Australia is that, previously, the knighthood was historically for what was termed 'the establishment.' Now, this is an accolade for somebody who comes from a working-class background. Someone whose father was a truck driver and decided to buy a truck.","Gaining my education from practical experience certainly benefited me. If I had gone on to be a lawyer, my life wouldn't have been anywhere near as interesting.","To start your working life after you've graduated from school and university, it takes you a long time to get started in the real world. Today, kids are not out into the workforce until 27 or 30 years of age. By the time I was 30, I had six kids and 60 trucks.","At Linfox we have zero tolerance. If any alcohol or drugs are found in any drivers' blood, they are instantly dismissed."],"Lindsay Hartley":["I was devastated when 'Days' let me go and couldn't help but feel it was my fault. What did I do wrong? What happened? It sucks. You always think it's your fault.","The confirmation for both jobs - 'AMC' and 'Smallville' - came through on the same day, so there was a lot of wine flowing in the Hartley house that night!","I just want to keep going with the soaps. Maybe it's because I'm just so used to them. I was 21 when I started 'Passions' and did that for nine years. It's what I know.","I started in musicals. My first professional experience was Dorothy in 'The Wizard of Oz' in Palm Springs.","There is an event once a year that I'm able to sing at, through 'Passions,' in Tennessee. That's always fun. We perform at the Wild Horse Saloon.","I've been doing musicals since forever. Actually, I was focused on singing and becoming a singer until I landed on 'Passions.'","When I left 'Days of Our Lives,' I was like, 'I don't know if I'm ever working again. I'm going to do the best I can. If it happens, great. If not, well... it sucks for me.'","If you've got comic book fans and soap fans and country fans, I think you've hit the whole world. What else is there?","When I say, 'We're a team,' the reason why I point that out is because at 'All My Children,' that's the mindset. They're a team. And I've said this to other people: They're like a united front."],"Lindsay Lohan":["Everyone has highs and lows that they have to learn from, but every morning I start off with a good head on my shoulders, saying to myself, 'It's going to be a good day!'.","On a day when you're tired, it's important to just say good morning to everyone so they're kind of aware that it's gonna be a good day. Jamie Lee Curtis told me that.","My motto is: Live every day to the fullest - in moderation.","I'm 20 years old. I like to party as much as anyone my age. Going clubbing is my way of relaxing or releasing a lot of stress. I don't feel that I should have to justify that part of my life. I don't know that I'm necessarily an addict.","I did get to work with Anthony Hopkins on 'The Human Stain.' If I ever manage to accomplish a quarter of what he's achieved, I'll have had one hell of a career.","I am happy being able to play roles with people my age because once you do something really mature there is no turning back.","Life is full of risks anyway; why not take them?","I know that in my past I was young and irresponsible - but that's what growing up is. You learn from your mistakes.","Beauty is grace and confidence. I've learned to accept and appreciate what nature gave me.","Substance abuse is a disease which doesn't go away overnight. I'm working hard to overcome it. I did fail my recent drug test. I'm prepared to face the consequences.","Normalcy is not interesting.","Say 'no' more than 'yes,' and just make sure you surround yourself with good people.","I want to win an Oscar. I want to be known for more than, like, going out. For being the 'party girl'. I hate that. I bust my ass when I'm filming and when I have time off, yeah, I like to go out and dance.","I'll probably pursue doing more movies, but not horror or movies with killers in them. I'll try to stick to happy movies. I want to act and direct like Jodie Foster. I admire her because she went to college and she's still doing the same thing.","My little sister Aliana's opinions are the most important to me. She says, 'I want to look like you, you're so pretty!' But she is very beautiful and so she is trouble in the making! She wants to do what I do. I'm like her second mother and I am very protective of her.","My mom is going to kill me for talking about sleeping with people. But I don't want to put myself in the position where I'm in a monogamous relationship right now. I'm not dating just one person. 'Sex and the City' changed everything for me because those girls would sleep with so many people.","I want to be remembered for the work that I've done, rather than the car accidents that I've gotten into, the men that I've not dated - or the man that I have.","Never say never. The things that you don't plan are the best. I'm a very spontaneous person.","There's a way of dealing with hardships that are healthier than going out. That's what I've learned.","I want to get married before I'm 30. And I'd like to win an Oscar before then.","It's so weird that I went to rehab. I always said that I would die before I went to rehab. But I thought, 'I'm going to stay here tonight.' And I stayed there for a month. It was great.","I love my red hair. It makes me spunkier.","When someone tells me not to do something, I'll do it more.","If I dated as many people as they said I have, then I would be dead, because it's just not possible.","I'm an angel compared to some of my friends.","I don't care what anyone says.","I never rebelled against my parents - I worked hard, I was responsible, and I didn't go to high-school parties.","It's funny because being comedic and happy and lighthearted is who I am as a person, so they're easier emotions for me to connect with.","I'm my own worst enemy and I know that.","I don't know if I am cut out to playing a bad character or not - I really should give it a shot. I would like to play the voice of a baddie, but that's really just a cop-out!","How can you not like Britney Spears?","I write most of my own lyrics for my album and I am helping to produce some of the songs as well.","I really enjoy singing and I really enjoy acting, but singing I've been doing since I was really young.","I hate it when people call me a teen queen.","I'm not going to deny the fact that I've tried pot. I hated it.","I'm not that girl from Freaky Friday any more! I'm a real adult. In fact, I hate children! I hate them all!","I'm the hardest working person I know. I'm 20 years old - is it a crime to want to go out dancing with my friends?","My mum says, 'Go with your first instinct,' but this can lead to impulse buying!","My brother Cody is 19. He wants to stay out of the limelight and become a lawyer. I want him to be an entertainment lawyer, so he can help me out!","I write a lot of lyrics and I'm involved in the producing process, because it's like, if I'm singing it, I want it to be something that I can relate to.","Marriage is a big deal, but who's to say I'm not going to pull a Vegas and get married to see what it's like for a minute?","So many people preach that they love fashion, but really it's what I live for!","I'm not skinny for the wrong reasons. It's not because I'm bulimic or anorexic or doing drugs. Compared to a lot of actresses my age, I'm actually overweight.","You shouldn't have to give things up for someone. If you love them someone, you should love them for everything they do and all that they are. I love acting and I wouldn't give it up for anything, and I don't know anyone in my life who would ask me to give it up.","I want to set up orphanages for underprivileged and abused children.","It's my body. And I like my body. And I like my breasts. And no, they're not fake.","I think a woman's body is so much more sensual than a man's. I'm not saying strip off all your clothes, but there are certain photos I like people taking of me, where I'm comfortable. As long as it's tasteful, why not?","People go to college to find who they are as a person and find what they want to do in life, and I kind of already know that so it would be like I'd be taking a step back or something.","If I can change bodies with anyone, it would be Britney Spears because how can you not like Britney Spears?","Compared to a lot of actresses my age, I'm actually overweight.","I want to give back. I want to do all the things that will make me feel fulfilled. But whenever I do those things, people think it's a press stunt or something.","I wanted to be a movie star. But movie stars are not what they used to be.","When I was a kid, I thought movie stars were women and men who were in these great films that we still look at now. But I don't think there are too many films coming out these days that we're going to look at in the future and say, 'This is one of the great ones.'","This is what I asked for, and in this day and age that's what actually goes on. But what hurts me the most is that I work just as hard as any other actress around my age, like Scarlett Johansson, but I just don't get the opportunities that they get because people are so distracted by the mess that I created in my life.","I think my biggest focus for myself is learning how to continue to get through the trauma that my father has caused in my life.","So many people around me would say they cared for the wrong reasons. A lot of people were pulling from me, taking from me and not giving.","I just love fashion. I think it just expresses who you are so much.","Obviously, I want to sell records, but I do it because I find it therapeutic. In music I can be myself.","I still need to go through the process of proving myself.","I've become more of a homebody, and I like that.","I have always admired and had enormous respect for Elizabeth Taylor. She was not only an incredible actress but an amazing woman as well.","I don't like to talk about politics. If you say you're a Democrat, that'll turn off Republicans, and that's half of your fan base.","I want to act and direct like Jodie Foster. I admire her because she went to college and she is still doing the same thing.","Because I'm so much in the spotlight, people lose sight of why I'm in the industry. In fact, I'm doing all this because I love to act. I love to perform, to sing.","Partying and having all of those pictures taken distracts from the work that I do. It's not why I started acting. I didn't get into acting to be written about. It kind of just happened - so I accept that it's my life.","I'm really in touch, whether it's prayer or meditation... there are so many powers greater than me in the world. I've been blessed and lucky enough to have been given a gift to share with other people.","I hate the bad rap that people give my parents. Because they are just parents, really, at the end of the day trying to stand up for their daughter and themselves.","I live without regrets. There are certain things I have done, mistakes that I made, that I would change, but I don't regret them at all, because I've learnt from them.","I'm at my happiest when I'm on a movie set. It's like therapy for me.","I just feel as though it's become a situation where people have manifested this caricature of who I am, and they act as if there's no real person inside of it.","If you're fighting with your boyfriend, you can go to the movies and cry it out and leave happy because the ending of the film is happy.","When I was younger, I started taking singing lessons and dance and acting. I just started acting first because that's how everything happened.","I think Christina Aguilera is great; I would love to work with her.","I did say that I wanted to be a young mom, just because my mom was a young mom. It is better because I can be closer to my kids and stuff.","My mom is very close to me, and it has been really cool having a mom that's closer to my age because she can go out with me and stuff.","I've always been interested in singing, and I've always been singing and dancing since I was little.","When I did 'Parent Trap,' I was ten. I was thrown off by the whole fame thing.","I want to interact with my fans, and I want to let people know what I'm doing and stuff like that because I'd want to know.","I would switch roles with Madonna for a day. Or if Audrey Hepburn was still alive, Audrey Hepburn. I love Audrey Hepburn. She's one of my idols, also."],"Lindsay Pearce":["Really, who's the best at what they do? There's always room for improvement.","I'm not an idiot: I know that I can sing and I know that I can act.","I would never dispute that I've been given a gift by God. That's something I've been raised to believe. I'm not an idiot: I know that I can sing, and I know that I can act.","What I've learned is you don't have to strive for perfection, but you do have to strive to be a very hard worker.","I can't shoot myself in the foot before I get in the chorus line.","I understand why it's hard to pin me down because I really relate to so many things. Like, for example, when people ask me what's my favorite music, I can't tell them. I love everything.","Whatever you want me to play, I'll just do it.","I was shy and didn't believe in myself, and I only bloomed when I was in theater during rehearsal. And that's how my family found out that that's where I needed to be, because that's where I felt the most comfortable.","The funny thing is I'm actually really insecure. I have a lot of girl issues - 'I'm not pretty enough,' 'I'm not skinny enough' - but there is a confidence I have in what I can do. I did tend to overcompensate to cover up other insecurities that I have.","I was born deaf, and I gained my hearing back when I was six months old - it was a miraculous event.","Before it was decided that I was going to be adopted, my mother was going to abort me. I was born with tangled legs; they never thought I'd be able to dance... without knowing it, as a child I overcame a lot thanks to really doting, loving parents and a great family and a hard work ethic on my part.","I always believed I was an ugly duckling in a family of swans, you know? I was such a black sheep, and it was the same way in high school... I was just kind of that awkward theater kid with a bunch of athletes... it was very 'Glee.'","All generations of teens have it hard, I think. Each society and century has its struggles that the others can't compare to.","The stage is home, and there's no place like it.","I like to go to the gym with my girls, practice yoga, try new recipes, bake, have slumber parties, go to the beach, have adventures, book hunt, shop for new records, or road trip somewhere... anything that keeps me laughing and excited about the day, really. I like feeling free to do what I or my friends want to do on our days off."],"Lindsay Price":["I don't have a fear of becoming a parent, but I do have a fear of taking care of a newborn because they are so tiny and vulnerable.","I have to just get up early and make sure I run. I'll do 40 minutes, four miles. It's not easy, but it clears my head.","I'm liking the different types of tights that you can wear with high heels. There are lots of different colors and textures.","Work used to be the No. 1 important thing to me. Everything revolved around it, and to have a new perspective and have something else, my family, not just being a mom but being a part of an incredible family of my own, it makes me have a different perspective on life that I think is richer.","Everything that I do has to be something new and something challenging, or with people that I want to work with. I take jobs for different reasons.","Everyone says TV's going down the tubes, and it's all reality, but there's some really good writing and some amazing opportunities if you're lucky enough to throw your hat in the ring.","The truth is, if you're lucky enough to work, you're a lucky actor."],"Lindsay Pulsipher":["I think that playing characters far away from who I am as a person is a lot more fun and a lot more exciting, and you can play with it a lot more because it's not you and it's so far from you, so that's very liberating as far as that goes.","It's just so much more exciting to have no limits and to be able to take your character as far as you want or need to get where you want to go.","In real life, my parents pretty much approved of all my boyfriends. I guess I was doing something wrong. I should have been more rebellious.","I was at Target the day after my kinda debut on 'True Blood,' and I got recognized right away. I was very surprised. It caught me off-guard.","'True Blood' fans are very friendly, so everybody's been very friendly and positive.","'True Blood' is truly a playground. You get to go in and just let loose and completely just have fun and play around. There is so much freedom on set."],"Lindsay Sloane":["I feel like most actresses kind of have issues in body dysmorphia.","I kind of learned that I am way too tough of a critic on myself and that other people are not judging me as harshly as I judge myself, so I need to give myself a break.","When actors are comfortable enough, and you release all your inhibitions, and you stop judging yourself, you're suddenly so supportive that it's this wonderful team cheering each other on."],"Lindsay Wagner":["When we shift our perception, our experience changes.","Once you go inside and weed through the muck, you will find the real beauty, the truth about yourself.","I've experienced several different healing methodologies over the years - counseling, self-help seminars, and I've read a lot - but none of them will work unless you really want to heal.","A lot of people say they want to get out of pain, and I'm sure that's true, but they aren't willing to make healing a high priority. They aren't willing to look inside to see the source of their pain in order to deal with it.","It's about sharing. You just give what you have to give wherever you go, and you let God handle the rest.","I'm so optimistic, it's depressing.","Then no matter what goes on around you in the physical universe, hang on to what you know.","If you really want to be able to express what goes on with other people, you have to be able to look at them and empathize with them and not judge who they are and what they do.","I started taking acting classes when I was twelve.","Finally I had a place where I could express my pain and I felt safe because I didn't have to put my name on it. I think acting kept me alive back then.","The fact that it's science fiction gives you the license to do anything you want to do.","And I can't tell you how many women from a certain age group - they would be in their 30s now, 20s and 30s - tell me about how I was their role model when they were young girls.","I think it's safe to say that each of us has at least one issue we are passionate about and struggle with, issues that robs us of our peace, our joy and our ability to experience love.","There is only one issue: man's lack of experience in feeling his Divine self and his innate connection with the Divine. All other issues stem from this.","Our breath gets shallow and ineffective when we are in a stressed state. I advocate stopping whatever you're doing for a couple of minutes five times a day, closing your eyes and taking deep breaths.","My comedy is different than a lot of people's.","I did the 'Bionic Woman,' which of course had a lot of humor in it, and that was really a function of a lot of the ad-libbing and the things that I did in it.","The life force knows exactly what it takes to keep any particular living organism - any organism - alive. Anything in manifestation, for that matter. Even a rock is a manifestation of some sort, and you know, in physics and quantum physics, they know a rock is not dead.","Our experience of many life circumstances is a function of our personal perspective and not the circumstance itself.","I was pretty locked up emotionally as a kid - my family situation was tumultuous. But I was extroverted. So when I was in pain, I would tell jokes instead of expressing myself.","I actually started acting because I couldn't dance.","The acting served as an outlet for my emotions for some time because I was doing it under the guise of someone else. And that can only be therapeutic up to a point until you truly deal with it and can express it to someone directly. Acting was a helpful outlet for me as a child. In some ways, I can say it saved my life.","Sometimes I think I might have children while I'm still working, but then I think I'd better wait until I can give them all I want to give.","I was at a banquet, and I went into the ladies' room, and I'm in the stall doing my business, and a piece of paper and pen came from outside the door, and she says, 'Ms. Wagner, would you please sign this for me?' And I said, 'Are you kidding me?'","I was raised on T.V. dinners because in those days, they were considered a well-balanced meal. And when I was sick, my mother fed me beef-barley soup and peanut butter sandwiches. That's about it for childhood food memories.","As I got older and more educated about things like chemicals in food and how beef is processed, I simply stopped eating certain things because it felt like the right thing to do.","Whatever anybody eats is their business. I'm just a vegetarian because I personally want to be. If my sons want to go have a steak... then that's their decision. But coming from my hand, as their mother, I have to give them what I feel is good for them. I don't take a stand morally. This is for myself.","My favorite splurges are cheese pizza with hot peppers, Haagen-Dazs maple-walnut ice cream, Giant brand ice cream sandwiches, and fire sticks - those hot candies the size of a three-inch ruler.","There's no way we could take cars off the planet and not have our society fall apart. So they're a necessary evil, in that sense."],"Lindsey Buckingham":["The thought of being on my own really terrified me. But then I realized being alone is really a cleansing thing.","You can look at 'Rumours' and say, 'Well, the album is bright, and it's clean, and it's sunny.' But everything underneath is so dark and murky. What was going on between us created a resonance that goes beyond the music itself.","There's a certain kind of idealism attached to 'Tusk' as a subtext to the music, and I think people now can respond not only to how colorful and experimental it is, but also why it was made.","Sometimes I wish we were the Eagles. That's one thing they've always been able to do is want the same thing for the same reasons.","I don't know what 'genius' even means. It's just a matter of keeping your eye on the ball.","'Tango' was a good experience, looking back on it, and it seems to hold up pretty well.","When you become successful on the level that Fleetwood Mac did, it gives you financial freedom, which should allow you to follow your impulses. But oddly enough, they become much harder to follow.","One thing I admire about the Eagles is they always seem to know what they want. They always seem to know why they want it. They always seem to want it at the same time.","You just get out there and be what you want to be. That's part of evolving and part of staying true to yourself - part of remaining alive in a real authentic, long-term sense creatively: not listening to what other people tell you to be.","That's one of the real downfalls of celebrity. You're something that's about you at some point, and that gets latched onto and pumped into the machinery. Then you start having a million other people telling you who you are, and what you should be doing and why, and it's easy to lose your way.","For me, none of the albums after 'Tusk' quite had it. I think we lost something after that.","A house full of new furniture doesn't mean a whole lot.","There is nothing like this extended family that is Fleetwood Mac. And I think you have to say, for all the perceived and real dysfunction that there has been, underneath that, there is and always has been a great deal of love. And that keeps pulling us back together.","I was always interested in listening to music - and, of course, when my older brother brought home 'Heartbreak Hotel,' that was it.","You know, I was never totally thrilled with being a Fleetwood Mac member, but surprisingly, I was having such a good time reuniting with John, Mick, and Stevie.","Most people don't know who the hell I am. But that's not really important.","I just find things that work and embellish them.","You're not going to reinvent the wheel every time you go out, because that would disappoint the audience.","The most disappointing thing to me after 'Tusk' was the politics in the band. They said, 'We're not going to do that again.' I felt dead in the water from that. On 'Mirage,' I was treading water, saying, 'Okay, whatever,' and taking a passive role.","You could say that Fleetwood Mac is a bit of a dysfunctional family, but we are a family.","When I work alone, my process is like painting. With Fleetwood Mac, it's more like movie making.","Years on, Christine and John still have a deep love for each other, as do Stevie and I - we've been working together since I was 17.","I love to be in the studio. That's what I like to do best.","Defining something being a Fleetwood Mac song is calling it a Fleetwood Mac song, you know? Nothing becomes Fleetwood Mac until that's what you call it.","After the success of 'Rumours,' we were in this zone with this certain scale of success. By that point, the success detaches from the music, and the success becomes about the success. The phenomenon becomes about the phenomenon.","'Tusk' was clearly a line in the sand that I drew.","It hasn't always been easy, but you get to a point where you're not doing the solo stuff with any kind of expectation in terms of commercial or a business outcome, you're doing it because you believe in this.","As I've grown as an artist, I've gotten more and more in touch with my center, and that center is voice and guitar.","I'm trying to break down preconceptions about what pop music is.","I'm not really concerned with the outer success.","I liked 'Rumours,' but to me, there was some point where the focus became the sales, not the music.","Some days I would be there at ten in the morning and wouldn't leave till ten at night, and the others would waltz in for a couple of hours and then leave, because I was doing that painting thing. And they were happy to see that being done.","After a couple of failed attempts, I came up with a weird tuning where I was dropping the G string down a step so that it became a seventh, and it got me to a place where I could play all these figures fairly easily. It was not an easy thing to work out.","All of my style came from listening to records.","Another thing that was unique about working on this stuff was that I was engineering it. I used many of the things I had learned while I was away from the band. It sort of vindicated my decision to leave in '87.","But by taking the time away, getting myself off the treadmill, and just slowing down and learning, I felt I had so much more to give back. And maybe that was something that needed to happen for all of us.","Confounding people's expectations was a way to maintain integrity.","Even though I had pushed through the Tango album, it was just not a very good environment to be in on a daily basis. In many ways, this is the best time of my life.","I also learned to be more confident, to trust my instincts more.","I didn't take lessons, and I don't know my scales.","I had to seal off my feelings about Stevie while seeing her every day and having to help her, too. But you get on with it. What was happening to the band was much bigger than any of that.","I was playing a Fender Telecaster when I first joined.","I'm also married for the first time, and I have two kids. So there's some kind of good karma right now.","Ironically, that was quite a bit of the appeal of Rumours. It's equally interesting on a musical level and as a soap opera.","It's really touching that we can come back after so long and care about making an album that says as much as this one does. And after all this time, we really do care about each other.","That's basically what's going on now: Everything is propaganda.","That's one strength that Stevie has. She's really not a strong instrumentalist in any way. Her instrument is her voice and her words. And it keeps her focused on the very center of that.","That's the only way to do it. Just like an actor. You can get a great performance if you do a bunch of takes and edit it. You find the moments and string them together.","The 12 years I was in Fleetwood Mac before were not particularly happy years. I was not in a very good place, psychologically, when I left. I didn't have a lot of confidence in what I was doing.","The writing is all done, so it's all about verbalizing everything from point A to point B, and certainly there's a bit of politics involved, so it's a different thing.","They tried to get me to use a pick when I first joined the band. They had certain things they thought were appropriate. I tried to adapt as much as I could.","This time, there were no drugs involved. The hours were completely normal daytime hours. I think we were able to appreciate the interplay, where before we had taken it for granted.","Those 12 years, they were ambiguous at best.","When I work alone, it can be like dabbling with a canvas. Maybe you paint over bits, and it starts to form its own life and lead you off in a direction. It becomes an intuitive, subconscious process.","When Stevie and I joined the band, we were in the midst of breaking up, as were John and Christine. By the time Rumours was being recorded, things got worse in terms of psychology and drug use. It was a large exercise in denial - in order for me to get work done.","There have been several occasions during the course of Fleetwood Mac over the years where we've had to undermine whatever the business axioms might be to sort of keep aspiring as an artist in the long term, and the 'Tusk' album was one of those times.","You work in a band, and it tends to be more like moviemaking, I think. It tends to be more of a conscious, verbalized and, to some degree, political process.","I think when you work alone - the way I do it, anyway - you could sort of liken it to painting, where there's sort of a one-on-one with the canvas.","I can't judge myself by 'God Only Knows.' No one writes songs as good as that.","I'm in the position where I don't have to make commercial music to feed myself, so I have the luxury of being more experimental, if that's what I choose to do. I guess I've earned the right by being in the business for a while and paying the dues and taking the lumps.","Warner Bros. never really got behind the solo work. They always kind of drew a blank. I think they always were thinking, 'Well, this is nice, but let's get back to what's really important.'","My personal life is fairly barren.","As autobiographical as say the stuff on 'Rumours' was, I don't think we thought of it as such when we were writing it.","I actually like Taylor Swift. I admire what she's been able to do on some levels.","When I was a kid, and Elvis Presley broke through to a middle class, white audience, it was a sociological phenomenon that lasted through the Beatles and even a bit through Fleetwood Mac.","I seldom look back.","I have an amazing wife and three beautiful children, and that certainly makes you less obsessive about your art as a musician - which I've always felt was more like painting than anything.","There have been times when I've feared for my own well-being in the great scheme of things because, historically, the track record has not been kind to the guitar players in this band.","I'm very fortunate.","We really were poised to make 'Rumours 2,' and that could've been the beginning of kind of painting yourself into a corner in terms of living up to the labels that were being placed on you as a band.","The want to return to the fold doesn't mean you can repeat history.","If things are crazy in the studio, usually the road is times 10.","Lyrically, you know, most of the things on 'Rumours' were very autobiographical and very much conversations the three writers were having with other members of the band.","When you make music, and even if it's commercially successful, it doesn't mean that it's going to hold up. It takes time to sort of take stock of what you've done and whether it's got legs and whether it's going to really have a place.","I do think my lyrics have gotten... not necessarily more poetic, but more open to interpretation; they're less literal.","I couldn't put any kind of label on my production aesthetic.","I guess you can look at Fleetwood Mac as the 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' movies and my solo career as indie films.","If you look at the whole time I was in the band, I only did, like, three solo albums - two, really. 'Out Of The Cradle,' I had already left because we'd done 'Tango In The Night,' and it was sort of the logical extension of crazy in terms of everyone getting ready to hit the wall with their habits.","I honestly think part of the appeal of 'Rumours' was that it was sort of heroic. We managed to push through in the face of so much personal adversity.","You could almost say I'm someone who doesn't practice age.","Creating a set list is like making a running order for an album. Certain things get pitted against one another that make more sense. One song sets another one off, or it might diminish it. You're just constantly looking for the next thing that's gonna make sense in a particular place.","If you want to be an artist in the long run, it isn't necessarily a good axiom to repeat formulas over and over until they're used up.","The rest of the band had a cynical view towards the way 'Tusk' was made and the reasons why I thought it was important to move into new territory. It wasn't just negativity. There was open hostility. Then I got a certain amount of flak because it didn't sell as many as 'Rumours.'","'Big Love' was originally an ensemble song, but it's done now as a single guitar piece.","You come off the kind of commercial success that 'Rumours' had, and you see that there are limitations to that as well as freedoms.","If you go back to 'Louie Louie,' there's the whole element there, where you need to be able to appreciate what 'dumb' is in its profoundness.","You get to be a certain age - I am 58 - and it becomes tricky not to become a caricature of yourself.","When I was in a band after high school and in college, I didn't even play the guitar. I played the bass because I couldn't play lead, and I didn't have the gear.","I don't read music. I've never had a lesson. I don't know anything about music other than what my inner knowledge is.","My foundation is acoustic guitar, and it is finger-picking and all of that and sort of an orchestral style of playing. Lead guitar came later, more out of the necessity to do so because of expectations in a particular situation.","I've been playing since I was about 7. I never really used a pick very much. I mean, once in a while, if you're in a festive mood, you might draw a little blood, but nothing significant... But my hands aren't abused, really.","It's always been based around the song, and guitar-playing in the service of the song... The sensibility is about songs. I like to think of it as kind of 'refined primitive.'","A lot of people who have gone to music school have gotten their individuality stomped out of them. It becomes harder to find those instincts.","Certainly, whatever I learn while I'm out solo, I bring back to Fleetwood Mac.","If you talk about the 'Tango in the Night' album, the reason I didn't do that tour was because the album took about 10 months, and it was such an uncreative atmosphere.","There is a real joy to be able to get up and react to each other and appreciate the whole being greater than the sum of the parts, just the chemistry of the group.","I put out an album once every four or five years and it's kind of like starting over every time.","My center is not really my singing so much as my guitar playing.","I don't really think of myself so much as a writer as a stylist, someone who came into writing from the back door and has found it through a certain very specific and personal means.","What happens with artists, or people who start off doing things for the right reasons, is that you slowly start to paint yourself into a corner by doing what people outside of the creative world are asking you to do, and I think that's antithetical to being an artist.","You have to look at what 'Rumours' was, what drove the subject matter. You had two couples who were broken up or breaking up. And probably, you could say, success we had achieved was the catalyst for those breakups.","If everybody wanted to follow the left side of the pallet like I had on 'Tusk,' there would have been no need for me to do solo work.","I remember being a kid - if a new member joined a group, I just didn't like that at all.","I'm not ashamed of my personal life.","One of the things about Fleetwood Mac is, when we're not together, we don't talk a lot or keep in touch. We keep a healthy distance.","I always made the joke that I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when Warner Brothers first put 'Tusk' on and listened to it in their boardroom as a follow-up to 'Rumours.'","I don't practice per se. I learned to play on my own, taught myself how to play. I've never really had a lesson, and I don't read music. So all the stuff that I do doesn't come from the normal set of disciplines that they teach you where you sit down and run through scales for a particular number of minutes a day.","I'm not that knowledgeable with the guitar - I just find ways that are pretty creative, but it's all within the framework and the limitations of what I can do.","Back in 1985, I was working on my third solo album when the band came to me and asked me to produce the next Fleetwood Mac project. At that point, I put aside my solo work - which was half finished - and committed myself for the next seventeen months to producing 'Tango in the Night.'","The first couple shows I did by myself, I was looking around wondering where the rest of my band was.","That really was a lot of the appeal of 'Rumours.' The music was wonderful, but the music was also authentic because it was two couples breaking up and writing dialogue to each other. It was also appealing because we were rising to the occasion to follow our destiny.","There were a number of false starts where I was trying to make solo albums. They would get constantly folded into group efforts. In retrospect, I can say fair enough, that you call yourself a band member, and you've got to step up to the plate when the need arises.","If you are gonna participate in a band, you've got to be a band member in good standing, and you've got to think about the needs of the whole.","Arcade Fire seems to be doing very well; certainly, Phoenix is doing very well.","When I work alone, and I'm in my studio, and I'm playing a lot of the stuff myself, I think the style of it becomes something a little different.","When you work with a band, obviously you've got to present them with something they can get a hold of, so it has to be a little more fleshed out as a song. And then where it goes is more collaborative, obviously; it's more political possibly, certainly more a conscious process than a subconscious process, which the painting can be.","I was lucky enough to meet someone when I was about 46 and had my first child when I was 48, so I got started late, but I also got all that other stuff out of the way and was at a point where I could be a consistent presence at home.","Fleetwood Mac was one big lesson in adaptation for me. There were five very different personalities, and I suppose that made it great for a while.","I feel like fifteen years with Fleetwood Mac was like working on my thesis, doing research for some kind of paper.","I left Fleetwood Mac to make myself happy, and fortunately, it worked.","When people just decide they're going to reconvene, there's no guarantee that they're going to have any of that chemistry. Sometimes people try to do that, and it's a struggle to try to recreate what once was.","Studio D has a lot of symbolism for me.","Sometimes you can do the work in the moment, and you don't know whether it's going to really have meaning once time has elapsed.","One of the things about Fleetwood Mac, you gotta say, is that it's not very often that you get everyone to want the same thing at the same time.","We're not one of those bands that throws the names of all their songs in a hat and pulls them out right before they go on stage.","We've always had the sensibility that you work on the set, and you structure it, much like a play, where once you've got the lines down and blocking right, you freeze it, and then you go out and do what you're doing night after night. You want to structure something that has form and that builds the right dynamic from start to finish.","There is a lot of pressure to top yourself... to come up with a 'Rumours II,' and that seemed like a trap.","The only way I've been able to keep my sanity is to pull back when I feel like it's time to pull back."],"Lindsey Graham":["Social Security must be preserved and strengthened. But we need to be candid about the costs and willing to make the tough choices that real reform will require.","Iran is part of the problem, not the solution. And the Russian government is ignoring reality.","If 'Obama-care' becomes fully implemented in 2014, it's going to bankrupt states.","We don't have a lot of Reagan-type leaders in our party. Remember Ronald Reagan Democrats? I want a Republican that can attract Democrats.","The sooner we get started with alternative energy sources and recognize that fossil fuels makes us less secure as a nation, and more dangerous as a planet, the better off we'll be.","When it comes to fossil fuels, we're going to find more here and use less. Over time, we're going to become energy independent. I am tired of sending $300 billion overseas to buy oil from people who hate our guts. The choice between a weak economy and a strong environment is a false choice, that is not the choice I'll offer America.","I dare say there may be some men and women in the Armed Forces who are so decent that they would say: Give the Iraqi people money, we do not want to be paid back. That is the strength of our country.","Why did we go to war? Why did we pick people from South Carolina, California, and all the places in between to go to a foreign land and risk their lives and have some die? To make sure that Saddam Hussein could do no more damage to the region or us than he has already done.","President Bush has shown great leadership. He has said that the 21st century will not be ruled or dictated by terrorists, dictators, and murderers. He is absolutely right. God bless him for his resolve.","We cannot win this war on terror if people are undercutting us. And one way to undercut us is to empower Iran.","Well, the big elephant in the whole system is the baby boomer generation that marches through like a herd of elephants. And we begin to retire in 2008.","What's going on in the Senate is kind of a politics of escalation. We're getting sort of like the Mideast: pay back everybody when you're in charge.","Conservatives have a different view of a lot of issues versus our friends on the other side. The election determines how that shakes out.","It puts limits on criminals' rights to destroy unborn children without the permission of the woman.","The American consumer is also the American worker, and if we don't do something to protect our manufacturing base here at home, it is going to be hard to buy any retail goods.","The courtroom is a quiet place, Judge Roberts, where you park your political ideology, and you call the balls and you call the strikes.","The politics of judges is getting to be red hot.","We're failing when it comes to controlling spending.","We've got fifty people at Gitmo that are too dangerous to be let go that will never go through a normal criminal trial. Let's create a new legal system, so they'll have their day in court.","We will never win this war until we understand the effect that Guantanamo Bay has had on the overall war effort. And we'll never get the support of the American people if we can't prove to them that these folks that we're dealing with are not common criminals. We're going to keep them - keep you safe from them.","Detainee policy in this war is hard, it's complicated, but we must get it right. We would be better off as a nation if we could close Gitmo safely and start a new prison that he could use that the world would see as a better way to doing business.","If you increase taxes now on - at any level, it's going to make it harder to create jobs And we've lost 2 1/2 million jobs since the stimulus package passed. We're at 9.6 unemployment. So I don't think we tax too little, I think we spend too much.","The healthcare bill not only is a monstrosity in terms of growing the government and cutting out the private sector, the way it was passed was sleazy. Every old Washington trick was used to pass the healthcare bill.","There's a lot of things we can do to balance out what Obama's done and going forward show the American people the Republican Party can govern. I want a coalition of tea party people, independents, moderate Democrats trying to find a way to move this country forward before we become Greece.","I don't think it's rational for a country to try to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador in a restaurant in Washington.","I'm the ranking Republican on the foreign aid appropriations subcommittee, so I know Tunisia well.","The president of the United States let the consulate in Libya become a death trap.","You know, the commander-in-chief's first responsibility is look out for those in uniform who fight the wars.","The intelligence community gets hurt through sequestration.","Look how many millions of people are underemployed or have lost their jobs. The last thing I'm going to do is play politics with their future.","This idea of holding the Defense Department hostage to the tax debate makes me sick to my stomach. Knock it off.","It's really American to avoid paying taxes, legally.","I don't blame anybody for using the tax code to their advantage.","The Afghan security forces will always have the help of the U.S. American military to ensure that Afghanistan never fails.","The legal system in Afghanistan is very immature and porous.","Well, thank God for a media that will ask questions.","Thank God for some Republican control of one branch of the government.","Al Qaeda is alive and well in Libya, Iraq, Syria and the wars are not receding.","Iraq is falling apart.","It's one thing to shoot yourself in the foot.

We're becoming Greece if we don't work together.","We need somebody ready to be commander-in-chief on day one, who understands there are no moderates in Iran; they've been killed a long time ago."],"Lindsey Haun":["I don't take myself too seriously.","If you follow the trend, you'll always be right behind it.","My father played with Air Supply, Yes, B.B. King and even Sheryl Crow when she first started out, so I've sort of been around the industry for a long time.","My mother was a choreographer, so music has always been around.","I'm not really afraid of somebody who's very politically vocal. My mother is very strong, and I really believe in freedom of speech.","I think everybody has their pain. For me, the time that I really had to grow up was when I was 15 and I had my best friend die of leukemia. Watching somebody so strong go through that is definitely something that will give you a little bit of depth. There have been a lot of things that have happened in my life that has forced me to grow up.","I use acting to get away from myself and to live in someone else's skin, and I do singing to get inside my own skin. I need them both for my emotional health.","I was feeling really restless in my hard-rock band. I wanted to learn more about storytelling in music, and that's what country music is."],"Lindsey McKeon":["'Indigenous' is a bit of a gory thriller film that's centered around five best friends who take a vacation to Panama. They are enticed into the forbidden jungle by a local Panamanian and are being hunted by an indigenous creature - the legendary Chupacabra.","I go to acting class, and in acting class, I'm not the girl that brings in romantic comedies; I'm the girl that wants to do 'Girl Interrupted' all the time.","I was the last person to get high-speed Internet, I was the last person to get an iPod, the last person to get an iPhone... I travel to India for one month out of the year and I don't have a phone there, so I can go without, which is beautiful, too.","Oh my God, the luxuries we have in America. We just don't even realize because you live in it long enough and you come to expect it, but when you get to take a step outside of it you really, really get to recognize how blessed we are and how much we have.","Every being has flaws; the potential is always there to connect to the light or to darkness.","Once in a while, you'll get somebody who watched 'One Tree Hill' and 'Supernatural,' but by and large, whoever watches one show is very distinct. There's not a lot of crossover. It's like, 'This is my show, and I love this show. I know everything about this show. My show is my show, and it will be until I die.'","I am one of those faces that it's sometimes, 'Oh my God, you look so familiar, but I can't pinpoint it.'","My husband loves the '90s; he's an avid '90s movie watcher, and it drives me insane. Nothing real came out of the '90s! The bad bathing suits that came up too high on women's hips came out in the '90s!"],"Lindsey Shaw":["I just wanna give a big shout out to all the fans out there who have followed my work up until now. You guys are amazing!! Hearing from fans is the best feeling in the world.","Everywhere you look, there is a charity or a project in school to get involved in. In eighth grade, there was this program called CJSF, California Junior Scholarship Foundation. We were involved in soup kitchens and toy drives, and your school can set up something like that. If your school doesn't have a program like that, set one up.","I used to be and I still am into psychology. I would like to be able to pursue something like that, but I don't know. The older I've gotten, the more endearing this business has become and I can't really imagine leaving it.","I have been thinking about joining the Peace Corps. That is something that I would absolutely love to do. I think that would be an incredible experience, so that's an avenue that I might want to look at.","My biggest problem in middle school was catty girls, cliques, and trying to figure out if I wanted to be a part of one of those, just figuring out who I was and all that.","You know, I'm just grateful to be in this business and to be able to stay in it.","I would love to have my own show, and whatever movies come up, that would be fun to do too. But I love TV, and I love the art of the half-hour sitcom.","The thing about sports movies is, they can't help but feel epic - putting music to images, etc.","Each time that you're playing a character, it's hard to pick a favorite.","I am involved in Greenpeace. And I just recently completely switched my diet over to near-veganism. So you try to do little things that you can. I recycle every single day. Every single thing in my house that can be recycled is."],"Lindsey Stirling":["Sometimes, being different feels a lot like being alone. But with that being said, being true to that and being true to my standards and my way of doing things in my art and my music, everything that has made me feel very different... in the end, it has made me the happiest.","It's not like I try to be different, but every single person is unique, and every single person has special things to offer, and it's about embracing it and not being afraid of the fact that maybe you're different or quirky, but it's okay to be different, and it can be a wonderful thing.","I was told at first that being different was a bad thing. Everywhere I went, it was just, 'You're too different'... And it turned out that being different was the best thing that ever happened to my career. It is why people travel to my shows. It's why people want to hear my story and buy my book.","If your mom asks you to do the dishes, do not pull out your pirate attitude. But if someone tells you you're not good enough, says your dreams are too lofty, or claims there is no room in showbiz for a dancing violinist - well then, by all means, pull out your eye patch, my friend, and take to the high seas.","I just realized one day that I was so unhappy. And not only that, but I didn't even like the person that I was. I didn't even know who I was. And so 'Shatter Me' is about first discovering what was under the shell and then learning to love that person that was under it. And then not being afraid to break free.","The same way that I practiced the violin, the same way that I practiced my dance moves, I decided that I was going to practice being positive and practice loving myself.","Visualization - it's been huge for me. Your mind doesn't know the difference between imagination and reality. You can't always practice perfectly - my fingers will play a little bit out of tune, or my dance moves might not be as sharp - but in my mind, I can practice perfectly.","There are very few things that I love more than being on stage and performing, but more than anything, I want to be a positive role model for teenage girls.","I really feel like sometimes I'll write these songs, and I'll just think, 'You know that couldn't have come from me alone.' I believe that God inspires us. I believe that He gives us gifts and talents, and it's up to us to develop them and choose what we do with them.","Everybody has their demons that they face, and I went through a time when I thought it was impossible to love myself.","The great thing about YouTube is there are no gatekeepers. No one is waiting to tell you if you're good enough. It's just your audience.","I still follow the lifestyle of the Mormon church. I try to go to church every Sunday even when I'm on tour. It's not only my upbringing, but it helps me stay sane. It helps me remember my purpose and the overall picture of what is important to me and what makes me happy.","I feel like when I'm on stage and when I'm performing - or I think when anybody is developing their talents and sharing it - I think you glow.","I can remember dancing around living room with my two sisters to the music of Paganini and Mozart. I can still remember my dad combing the newspaper, circling all the free concerts in town, and on the weekends, we would go as a family.","If I like dubstep and electronic, why don't I make the violin fit me rather than making myself fit the violin?","I was classically trained. But more than just the fact that I play violin, there's a lot of classical elements in the way I write, in the way I hear chords. A lot of times, I think of my songs as a symphony made out of electronics rather than instruments. And I love to do orchestral arrangements of my songs after they're done.","Through my unique style of playing, I want to prove that you don't have to conform to be accepted. The greatest value comes from loving yourself for who you are.","I started making music that I loved and was passionate and excited about, but it was really cool when I started touring to realize it's an extremely diverse group of people who come out. In the front row, I'll have everyone from a little girl in a frilly tutu, to rockers and gamers and older couples. I love it that it's just everybody.","For several years I had no idea that I had become anorexic. And I'd be at places with people I cared about, but what I was thinking about was how much extra grease was on the pizza or the calories that I knew was in that shake.","A lot of people have told me along the way that my style and the music I do... is unmarketable. But the only reason I'm successful is because I have stayed true to myself.","I was struggling with anorexia, and one of the biggest problems with an eating disorder is you don't realize you have it. And you can't heal until you realize there's a problem.","I was told by so many people that I wouldn't succeed because I was too different. Ironically, the very reason that people watch my channel and travel thousands of miles to see a show... is because it's different. God didn't send us to Earth to just blend in. We are here to share what makes us unique.","If you're public speaking, imagine yourself feeling confident; if you're nervous about a date and thinking, 'I'm gonna be a dork,' picture yourself being funny. Then it will be familiar to your brain.","YouTube - holy cow! - I can do my career at my own pace. I didn't have anybody to tell me I wasn't ready, and I learned how to self-market and how to strategize. 'Spontaneous Me' had already been up on iTunes, but besides my mom and grandma, no one bought it. Once it was up on YouTube, it went crazy.","Online is such an important platform... it's all one giant melting pot of talents. The times are changing. It's just art now. You can share your audiences with everyone, and it's exciting.","Maker is extremely proactive and creative with their talent. They seem to have mastered the difficult task of giving attention to their smaller, growing channels while still being able to add value to their larger established channels - plus, with this partnership, I am one step closer to becoming a Disney princess!","There is one person that I have learned always sees the beauty in us, and that's our Savior Jesus Christ.","I want to make dubstep something beautiful.","A lot of my writing comes from the themes of my life, and a lot of that stems from my faith. I also strive to be a light through which Christ can shine, whether it's through the way I dress, though my videos, or through my music.","Europe in general is a great place for me, but specifically Germany has been very good to me. Germans love classical music... Electronic dance music is massive over there, so I'm kind of the marriage between the two.","I love to perform not only music, but to make performances extremely visual, and create almost a magical fantasy. It's really an uplifting style of art that combines visuals and music in very dreamlike ways.","It's really hard to smile when you play. As a performer, if I ever find myself focusing, it's like, 'Oh no - orchestra face!' It's not attractive at all, so I have to focus on smiling.","I was very unfamiliar with YouTube; I thought it was the place for dog and cat videos.","I never liked feeling like the world needed to have labels on everything, whether it's people or categories of music. I think everyone should be what they want to be, and you shouldn't have to look a certain way in order to fit this mold or that mold.","A lot of these reality-TV shows people go on, they come off, and nothing happens. You never hear from them again. Fifteen seconds of fame is not the name of the game. No matter how big you break, or how many people you break in front of, you still have to slowly build a fan base to have anything loyal and lasting from people.","When I first came to college, it was a time that I was trying to figure out, 'Who am I? What makes me special?' and I started to find most of my value in the fact that I was thin.","I think it's most important to, rather than just do what everybody else is doing, like tons of selfies, find out what makes you excited. You know, is it taking pictures and doing cool makeup and making yourself look great? If so, wonderful. Is it music? Is it teaching something? Are you great at teaching?","I've always had a fascination with pirates. You know, I've written a song completely inspired by I want this to feel like pirates, you know, fighting together, made a music video about it, yada, yada.","I always meditate before every show. I say a prayer with my crew and my band to get in the mode, and I also stretch because it's a very athletic show. We've got to entertain; it's what we do.","I tried so many different musics. I kind of burned out on classical and wanted to make it fun again. I started playing with indie bands and country bands and finally realized electronic music brought my style to life.","As a kid, I was creative and unique, and I've had that my whole life.","I submitted videos and applications to talent agencies and TV shows; I drove to Vegas and visited agents. I was on 'America's Got Talent'; I played for free at venues in attempts to be 'found' and yet all the experts in the entertainment industry told me that what I did was not marketable and that I had to join a group or do more traditional music.","My audience is a huge part of my success, so I see us as a team. They send me tons of song requests every day. Some of the songs I've never heard before, but I listen to them and then pick the ones that I love.","My favorite thing about the success I've found is that I get to share it with my family and the ones that I love.","I think YouTube used to have a negative connotation, like it was the place where the rejects went and made careers, but I'm proud to be YouTuber. I wanted to be in that first generation of YouTube stars who transitioned into the 'real world.' It was a really good way to build my business.","I never would've tried YouTube if I hadn't had so many doors slammed in my face.","All the things I do in my videos - the jumps, twirls and back bends - will also be onstage.","I tried to work with a record label; I tried to work with a booking agency, variety shows. I went to Vegas. I just tried everything I could think of, and nothing took. No one thought there was a place for my style and my music; it was just too different.","I just loved EDM because I felt like it inspired dance and movement.","The truth is that several years ago, I suffered from depression. And I remember during this time, I basically fell into this hole where my life became cold, and it became gray, and I lost sight of everything that was important to me.","I know that I received so much help from God to become that kind of person that I wanted to be. That's honestly the message that I think is in a lot of my songs.","I feel like my art is very eclectic. I have taken my favorite things - be that costume designing, fashion sense, music and video editing - and I threw them all into one big clump. And that's what I do.","I love going into the studio with just an idea of the direction. Like, I want this tempo... I love to start from scratch, and the tracks sort of take on a life of their own.","YouTube is such a funny little world. You can create a fanbase.","Coming from a YouTube perspective, a lot of times you kind of limit yourself and think, 'Oh, artists from the real world wouldn't want to work with someone who's made their career on YouTube.' But more and more, I'm realizing that artists from both sides are learning that we can benefit from each other.","YouTube did more for me than 'America's Got Talent.'","I played the violin my whole life. I wanted to play from the time I was just a little kid, and I've always loved dance as well. I wanted to make people smile. I wanted to add an extra energy to my playing and make it visual and make it unique and fun.","I got all these books about, like, what you need to know to enter the entertainment industry. And I remember I sent my music to record labels, and I took these little DVDs and sent them all over the place. And either no one got back to me or they just kept saying, 'You're too different.'","I have been so incredibly blessed, and I just feel like my calling is to be a missionary and share the gospel... The Lord's given me a platform to stand on and an audience that is listening. I feel like it's so important to share what makes me happy.","I draw inspiration from my life, and, honestly, a lot of my religious beliefs have stemmed into my music.","It really is ironic that the saddest I'd ever been was when I had 'achieved' all the things I had wanted. I was so disgustingly thin, but I was so unhappy.","It is so cool to be able to stand as a witness of Christ and to be able to be proud of it and be part of His army.","It is very unnatural to dance while playing the violin. I had to practice so hard to learn how to do it, but now it is part of my expression, and it comes naturally. I have to know a song perfectly before I can even begin to move.","Once I know a song really well, I can then have fun dancing.","It was Skrillex who got me into dubstep. He made it melodic - not just a bunch of crazy sounds.","Going to college is an amazing opportunity to not only learn and be book-smart but also to kind of stretch your wings and expand yourself as a human and as an artist, whatever it is you're going for.","Violinists' hands aren't the prettiest because of our nails and what our hands have to go through.","As a dancing violinist, there have been a couple of moments where I'm like, 'Oops! This is an expensive mistake!'","Every time before I go into the studio, I say a prayer, and I really ask God for inspiration.","I love singers like Hayley Williams from Paramore and Amy Lee from Evanescence.","I originally went to school to be a filmmaker. And so it's a big part of how I think and how I write. And it inspires me a lot.","There is such an advantage to self-releasing. If you can do it yourself, it's the best way to go. In Europe and the rest of world outside the U.S., I have licensed my music to labels. But it's amazing because I still own all the masters. I didn't have to give up any of those rights. I have 100 percent creative control.","There are so many things that can go wrong while performing. I've had violin strings break; I've had pants that were slowly falling down, and I'd have to pull them up in between every song; my hairpiece was falling out, so a big chunk of hair was just flapping around as I danced, and I've completely fallen on my butt.","What gives my art the most meaning is when I can connect with others through it. When people say that my music has helped them, or it makes them feel good, or it inspires them, that is what gives my art lasting meaning to me."],"Lindsey Vonn":["If you go around being afraid, you're never going to enjoy life. You have only one chance, so you've got to have fun.","It's amazing. Life changes very quickly, in a very positive way, if you let it.","Follow your dreams. If you have a goal, and you want to achieve it, then work hard and do everything you can to get there, and one day it will come true.","It's sexy and beautiful to be strong.","Especially when I'm in the gym, I get really motivated by hip-hop.","A part of me is missing when I can't ski, but I've learned there's more to define me and make me happy, like stand-up paddling and Jet Skiing - things I'd never done before. Or being with people I love and just enjoying life.","I hate being helpless, and I hate having to ask people to do things for me.","I snack on fruit and nuts. In the middle of my long workouts, I'll have a protein shake.","You have to be a little crazy to be a downhill skier.","I always ate healthy, but it wasn't scientific. Now it's a high-protein diet and no carbohydrates. I have more consistent energy, and I don't get tired after a meal. It does take a very detailed meal plan.","I try to eat on the healthier side, but baked goods are hard to resist. I just love sweet things.","You are only limited to what you push yourself to, you know? You can always get better.","I never thought my face would be on the cover of a Red Bull Six Pack.","It's hard to give tips to skiers if I don't know how they ski, but I think the most important thing in skiing is you have to be having fun. If you're having fun, then everything else will come easy to you.","I'm never tired of winning, and I'm never tired of skiing.","In the end, it's a mental maturity to let your best come out.","I don't want to leave skiing early. I want to feel like I've done everything I can do.","When my parents were getting divorced, I just said to myself, 'Go to sleep, and tomorrow you can go skiing.' I cried myself to sleep, and in the morning I was up on the mountain, and I was good.","It seems kind of silly, but it's really nice to chill in the kitchen with a friend and bake. It relaxes me, and mixing is probably my favorite part.","I always channeled what I felt emotionally into skiing - my insecurities, my anger, my disappointment. Skiing was always my outlet, and it worked.","Just in general, staying healthy and active is important.","Athletics at the highest level is a sport within a sport.","There is a dessert dish in Austria called Kaiserschmarrn - it's kind of like a sweet raisin pancake with eggs and sugar. It's definitely not something I can eat often, but if I've done well at a race, sometimes that's my celebration treat!","I love skiing fast. You're going 80 to 85 m.p.h. down an icy slope, and I love it.","The history of skiing is important to me.","Medals are decided by hundredths of a second, so I need assurance that my vision is perfect every time I compete, no matter what the conditions.","Tiger Woods makes me a better athlete.","I take risks - that's my life on the slopes and off.","My mother-in-law's from Norway, and she's always liked old-school remedies.","Setbacks motivate me.","I want to keep pushing the limits to see what's possible. That's the nice thing about ski racing - no one is stopping you from going faster.","When I first moved to Vail, it was like I was a little celebrity. You know, everyone knew my accomplishments. I was a young, fast teenager and making waves in the ski world. And it was really cool.","Everything about my life seemed so perfect to people. But I struggle like everyone else.","I feel like, with ski racing, you need to have a short memory. You crash all the time, and sometimes it's a really bad one, but sometimes it's not so bad.","When you fall, get right back up.","I get up early, but it doesn't mean I like getting up early.","If you work so hard to reach your goal but you lose your pole in the very last run, that's hard to take.","I really like figure skating.","I've always heard that heli-skiing in Alaska is amazing. I would love to be able to do that at some point in my life.","Vail's a very important place for me. Everyone kind of took me in and accepted me in that town, and they still have to this day. I wouldn't be a downhill skier if I hadn't been there.","Ninety percent of the day is working out. Sometimes I get my nails done and go to the grocery store.","Everyone saw me on TV or read articles, and it was all about my great marriage, the white picket fence, all this success and my perfect life. But behind the scenes, it was a struggle.","For sure, 2010 was the best year I've ever had. It couldn't have gone any better for me. Even if I just won the Olympic gold medal, that would have made it the best year of my career and the best day of my life, period. Winning the World Cup races and the overall title just topped it off.","I did gymnastics when I was a kid. I wasn't very good at it.","I love the cowbell. I think it's awesome. My family got the cowbell app on their iPhones. It's a classic part of ski racing.","I wouldn't change being married. It was good for me, and I was happy for a period of time, and I learned a lot about myself.","I wish it didn't take soooooo much to get physically to where I need to be.","Divorce doesn't fit my cookie-cutter image.","I went from being married to living on my own in L.A., to having a new boyfriend and just being totally self-sufficient and super independent. It's awesome. I love it!","When you're young, you develop ways to win, and you think they will always work, but then you get to the top, competing against the other top athletes, and sometimes things don't work.","I have a race routine. I have a team of people helping me. I have winning habits. I believe in myself. I have balance in my life.","I don't really believe that you need to be married to someone to be their life partner.","Everyone knows marriage is tough.","When I get on the World Cup tour, I'm kind of disconnected from the world. I just kind of get wrapped up in my world and wrapped up in trying to ski fast every day, and I forget about everything else.","There are times when one certain snow condition is great for one particular brand of skis.","Making ski racing fun and engaging for kids and families is an exciting opportunity and a real passion of mine.","Vail Resorts School of Shred program is a great way to help encourage kids to stay active by getting them outside and on the mountain.","It's so important for kids to get involved with sports in general at a young age.","An overall title is one of the biggest things you can win in our sport.","The Olympics are what I work for. They're why I spend so much time in the gym.","I want to show America who I am and inspire young kids.","You can get a big gust of wind, and your Olympics are over.","For someone to say I am overweight is completely ridiculous.","Ski racing is not about how much you weigh. If weight was the key, everybody would be sucking down food.","I feel like winning a world championship was a hurdle I had to get over.","Since childhood, sports has been one of the most important influences in my life.","I'm proud to be part of any Olympic team.","I'm not trying to get five medals. I'm not trying to be Michael Phelps.","My mom is positive and optimistic.","The thing is I have no ACL. So unless I get surgery, there's nothing really magical that I can do that's going to make it better. I just can get my leg stronger, my muscle stronger and try and support it a little more. But that has a small impact. My knee is loose, and it's not stable, and that's the way it's going to be from here on out.","I've been to a lot of photo shoots, and I see these girls that are just really thin. They're not healthy. They don't work out.","My childhood dream was to win the Olympics, and I've done that. Everything else is icing on the cake.","Records are the only thing that remain of an athlete, the only thing that people will remember. If I want to ensure that people don't forget me, I can only stop once I've set the bar as high as possible for anyone coming after me.","Golf is all about patience - one tournament is four days long, 18 holes a day.","In the winter, I'm always in Europe. July and September are New Zealand and Chile camps. I'm always on the road.","I ski very aggressively, and the angles that I create with my body are similar to some of the male racers.","People get nervous driving around corners, thinking they're going to tip over. But you can go soooo much faster through the curves than you realize.","I can be normal by myself; no one notices me."],"Lindsey Wixson":["I dress myself, not to impress, but for comfort and for style.","Real success is not, like, materialistic. It's being where you want to be when you want to be; just living your life how you feel; having an ultimate goal and being able to accomplish it.","Being nervous is a waste of time.","If you're a model, you're paid to be a muse.","I love singing, it lifts my spirit.","I measure the amount of shows I should do by my hair. If my hair isn't good for campaigns and editorials, then obviously I am not going to look good.","I love hats! I collect vintage ones - I find them at antique shops in Kansas.","If you're a model, you're supposed to know how to walk, aren't you?","If I didn't ever model? I would be back in Kansas. I would probably end up being a pastry chef. My grandma taught me how to make a pie.","I really like Amelia Earhart. She's from Kansas. She disappeared, so I have to take her place. I want to be Dorothy. I want to be Amelia Earhart... I want to do it all.","You can't just come from Kansas, go into fashion and be all naive. The fashion world is very different to where I'm from."],"Lindy Boggs":["Well, Hale was one of the first people who suggested to President Johnson that there should be a commission.","And Hale was devoted to President Kennedy, and there was some talk following the assassination that Hale had warned the President not to go to Dallas, and the connotation was that it would be physically dangerous for him to do so.","Hale had answered when the President of the United States can't go to a city of the United States and be protected, we've come to a very difficult time in our nation's history, and encouraged him to come.","But Hale's warning the President about going to Dallas was that there was great infighting among the members of the Democratic party and the Democratic stars in the state and he didn't want the President to become involved in a factional disagreement.","I just didn't want to admit that he was dead.","It has been a privilege beyond belief for me to have represented the State of Louisiana in Congress and to have been given the blessed assignment of U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See.","As a public official and being so highly visible, I have a responsibility to make it very clear that those people who will have cancer at one point in their lives will be able to function.","So many people are walking around looking so grim all the time. I just never understand why."],"Lindy Booth":["I'm terrified of heights, but I think there's something really beautiful about birds and soaring, having a bird's-eye view of the world.","It's so much easier for me to get up and be someone else than expressing my own thoughts and feelings. There's definitely something about creating a cloak of a character that helped me deal with my shyness.","I love running dresses! I need to make working out as enjoyable as possible, and a cute outfit is definitely part of that.","My feet are not a good part of my body. They definitely have suffered for my art. They're, like, all bunions and blisters.","My mom, dad, and sister have all watched every episode of everything I've ever done.","I literally think that if you're in this business, it has to be the only thing you can and want to do, because it's so hard. You have to be fully committed - and partially insane - to wake up every morning and be like, 'I'm an actor.'","The most terrifying thing in the world was having to give a speech at my girlfriend's wedding. I was physically shaking and sweating the entire time.","I'm painfully shy.","My poor sister was forced to be in the plays that I would write. We would go to my grandma's retirement building and perform 'Phantom of the Opera.'","I definitely have an alter ego that can come out and get me out of situations where I'm having social anxiety. I can take a deep breath and create a bubble so I can perform in some way.","This sounds geeky, but when I run, I like to listen to musicals like 'Les Miserables.' The soundtracks are 75 minutes or longer, and I keep going until the story ends, so it feels like a good workout.","For breakfast, I make an amazing protein shake with fruit, Greek yogurt, protein powder, flaxseed oil and honey. It's a nice way to get a healthy start and a little bit of sweetness, too.","I am a lip person. I constantly need a really good lip moisturizer with me. Mine is a Clairin's moisture replenishing lip balm. I have two of them: I have one I keep next to my bed, so it's the first and last thing in the morning and evening, and then 10 times a day in my purse.","I have an amazing 1930s dress I picked up in Toronto at Cabaret on Queen West. It's a red knee-length tea dress, and it's absolutely beautiful. It makes me happy every time I put it on."],"Linford Christie":["If you criticise something then you have to have an alternative, but we do have to try and improve things.","We have got to go out there and deliver, go on the streets and find athletes, improve facilities around the country and find coaches. We have got to go out there and search for a star.","There was no money in the sport but we'd be out there day in, day out, rain or shine, doing it.","Some of today's athletes do not have that kind of pride. They left school at 16, have never had a job in their life and are getting Lottery funding, earning money as an athlete.","My first love is the sport, and it will always be my priority.","I think it's great that they are getting funding, but it's just too easy. They don't have to work for it. We did it because we had pride, because we loved it.","I coach a few guys and they work very, very hard, but in our day we did it because we just loved it.","I am a coach on the outside of the establishment and that works.","Adopting a new healthier lifestyle can involve changing diet to include more fresh fruit and vegetables as well as increasing levels of exercise.","But I sometimes think we have too much of a fixation about 2012.","I don't think there are really enough meetings in Britain for our athletes to compete properly, and because of this a lot of the talent we have has been stunted.","I have got better things to do in working with my athletes who I feel are going to be involved in 2012.","I know what it takes to get to the top.","I think the athletes respond well to me because I have been successful.","Obviously I was disappointed when it fell into disuse, because it was my own track named after me, but I am sure all those youngsters we lost will be coming back, and I certainly intend to be down here as much as I can, coaching and advising."],"Link Wray":["You know, I'm an eagle, flying around in the mountains.","God is playing my guitar, I am with God when I play.","But I don't believe in organised politics, organised religion, organised music, organised anything.","I'm surprised that I actually pulled off the recording, getting all those people at the same time.","Because I'm not the same today as I was in '58, or '59 or even '71.","Elvis was rock'n'roll. He came from the poverty and the pain.","I just believe in my Indian, spiritual god and my music.","If you went to see me today, you might not like my music.","Money don't rule me, record companies don't rule me.","Soul music is pain - you can hear the slaves, the beatin' and the hurtin'."],"Linn Ullmann":["Playing with different genres and perspectives and ways of telling stories is one of the perks of being a novelist, but at the same time, I want precision. And in order to be precise about stuff, you have to get personal. Symbolism is very boring.","I began writing 'The Cold Song' in the months following my father's death, when I felt this sense of loss, disappearance, of being right in the middle of life and wondering: 'What now? How to proceed?'","Fairy tales and folk tales have always played a role in my writing in one way or another."],"Linton Kwesi Johnson":["I am often asked why I started to write poetry. The answer is that my motivation sprang from a visceral need to creatively articulate the experiences of the black youth of my generation, coming of age in a racist society.","I have never, ever sought validation from the arbiters of British poetic taste.","Once you have a disease like cancer, you look at life a bit differently. Some things that were important no longer seem as important as they were.","At the end of the day, life's about realising one's human potential. I don't know if I've realised mine, but I've certainly gone a long way towards realising some goals and some dreams.","Back in those early days when I began my apprenticeship as a poet, I also tried to voice our anger, spirit of defiance and resistance in a Jamaican poetic idiom.","I wrote two poems about the '81 uprisings: 'Di Great Insohreckshan' and 'Mekin Histri.' I wrote those two poems from the perspective of those who had taken part in the Brixton riots. The tone of the poem is celebratory because I wanted to capture the mood of exhilaration felt by black people at the time.","The more I read my poems, the more I find out about them. I still read them with the same passion I felt when I wrote them as a young man.","I don't go to see bands any more because I've got tinnitus, so I have to avoid loud music. You get used to it, but when it's quiet you hear a constant ringing.","The modern stuff, I can take it or leave it. I like its danceability, but the DJs talk a lot of nonsense.","Younger people are discovering my work, even though my reggae is not like theirs."],"Linus Pauling":["Science is the search for truth, that is the effort to understand the world: it involves the rejection of bias, of dogma, of revelation, but not the rejection of morality.","The best way to have a good idea is to have a lot of ideas.","By the proper intakes of vitamins and other nutrients and by following a few other healthful practices from youth or middle age on, you can, I believe, extend your life and years of well-being by twenty-five or even thirty-five years.","No evidence compels the conclusion that the minimum required intake of any vitamin comes close to the optimum intake that sustains good health.","The way to get good ideas is to get lots of ideas and throw the bad ones away.","Satisfaction of one's curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness in life.","I hear from patients who say their doctor said, 'If you want to take Vitamin C, go ahead and do it. It won't harm you, and it may do you some good.' More and more physicians are getting convinced about the value of large doses of Vitamin C.","Everyone should know that most cancer research is largely a fraud, and that the major cancer research organizations are derelict in their duties to the people who support them.","Nations keep agreements, keep their treaties so long as they continue to do them good.","Facts are the air of scientists. Without them you can never fly.","If you take a reasonable amount of vitamin C regularly, the incidence of the common cold goes down. If you get a cold and start immediately, as soon as you start sneezing and sniffling, the cold just doesn't get going.","I believe all complicated phenomena can be explained by simpler scientific principles.","I believe that you can, by taking some simple and inexpensive measures, lead a longer life and extend your years of well-being. My most important recommendation is that you take vitamins every day in optimum amounts to supplement the vitamins that you receive in your food."],"Linus Roache":["When you've got good writing, you can kind of give up all the research, in a way, and start just following the emotional integrity of the journey of your character.","I've been to India a lot, ever since when my mum was in 'Jewel In The Crown.'","I realised success as an actor alone wouldn't make me happy. I needed to explore my spiritual side in more depth.","Dad has always been - and still is - a great influence on me. He has always stood up for spirit, staying true to his beliefs... and I like to do the same with regard to my own true beliefs, regardless of potential criticism or mockery.","In the end, it's your job to own the role, and in the end, you are playing certain aspects of your own self, even.","Most of the TV shows I've done have all been in the U.S.","I love working in films.","There's so much cynicism around in Britain, especially in the press. The American press might be naive, but at least you feel as if they're on your side.","When I went to drama school, I thought that everybody would think I was only there because my dad was on TV.","You might get one job for having a famous parent, but you won't get your second unless you're good.","The Vikings themselves are fascinating creatures. They're human beings, of course, but their ethos are so different from ours. The fact that they live as warriors - their willingness to die for the sake of what they believe in - is quite shocking to us, and it's fascinating to see.","I'd be willing to do anything. I'm not precious. I'd wash dishes.","In modern times, if you're on an airplane and it's going down, that's it. You've got a couple of minutes, if that, to work out where you stand in relationship to the whole of your life.","Both my parents are actors, in very different ways.","A spiritual life is 24 hours a day, seven days a week. How do you live? What's true? How do you respond? It's not about living by beliefs; it's about wanting to know.","New York, without a doubt, is my favorite city in the world.","If you count my childhood appearances in a few TV shows and being the son of two well-known actor parents in the U.K., plus three years of drama school, you could say that I've been pretty much surrounded by the business of acting and performing my entire life.","I briefly flirted with some of the new age offerings available in the early '90s and found strength in Buddhism, but ultimately I was looking for something that was not tied to tradition.","It seems to me that whatever path you choose to take, in the end its up to each of us to try, test and live what we find out, to apply it and see what actually works, and that's the exciting and challenging part of this very real adventure.","Part of me wanted to disappear into a cave in India, and I did end up going on retreats there, but, don't ask me why, I always felt very strongly that the point for me was to find a way to live a truly spiritual life in the modern day world and be able to work with all the positive aspects of our cultural and technological advancements.","Trying to act cold is a challenge when your makeup's running and sweat is pouring down your neck.","I shot a pilot for ABC, which I'm a bit confused about what the actual title is - I heard it was called 'Chosen.' It's directed by Roland Emmerich - the master of disaster himself - and it's his idea and concept for the show that's a supernatural thriller about good and evil set in contemporary modern day New York.","I just love variety. I love being able to do different things. Do period pieces and sci-fi. I love being able to move between genres and be flexible."],"Linus Torvalds":["Software is like sex: it's better when it's free.","The Linux philosophy is 'Laugh in the face of danger'. Oops. Wrong One. 'Do it yourself'. Yes, that's it.","Microsoft isn't evil, they just make really crappy operating systems.","There are lots of Linux users who don't care how the kernel works, but only want to use it. That is a tribute to how good Linux is.","Once you start thinking more about where you want to be than about making the best product, you're screwed.","If Microsoft ever does applications for Linux it means I've won.","In real open source, you have the right to control your own destiny.","I often compare open source to science. To where science took this whole notion of developing ideas in the open and improving on other peoples' ideas and making it into what science is today and the incredible advances that we have had. And I compare that to witchcraft and alchemy, where openness was something you didn't do.","I get the biggest enjoyment from the random and unexpected places. Linux on cellphones or refrigerators, just because it's so not what I envisioned it. Or on supercomputers.","Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.","Intelligence is the ability to avoid doing work, yet getting the work done.","In open source, we feel strongly that to really do something well, you have to get a lot of people involved.","Any program is only as good as it is useful.","Programmers are in the enviable position of not only getting to do what they want to, but because the end result is so important they get paid to do it. There are other professions like that, but not that many.","There were open source projects and free software before Linux was there. Linux in many ways is one of the more visible and one of the bigger technical projects in this area, and it changed how people looked at it because Linux took both the practical and ideological approach.","I think, fundamentally, open source does tend to be more stable software. It's the right way to do things.","Fairly cheap home computing was what changed my life.","I've been very happy with the commercial Linux CD-ROM vendors linux Red Hat.","I'm a technical manager, but I don't have to take care of people. I only have to worry about technology itself.","The fame and reputation part came later, and never was much of a motivator, although it did enable me to work without feeling guilty about neglecting my studies.","By staying neutral, I end up being somebody that everybody can trust. Even if they don't always agree with my decisions, they know I'm not working against them.","See, you not only have to be a good coder to create a system like Linux, you have to be a sneaky bastard too.","I think of myself as an engineer, not as a visionary or 'big thinker.' I don't have any lofty goals.","My name is Linus, and I am your God.","I'm perfectly happy complaining, because it's cathartic, and I'm perfectly happy arguing with people on the Internet because arguing is my favourite pastime - not programming.","I actually think that I'm a rather optimistic and happy person; it's just that I'm not a very positive person, if you see the difference.","An individual developer like me cares about writing the new code and making it as interesting and efficient as possible. But very few people want to do the testing.","That's what makes Linux so good: you put in something, and that effort multiplies. It's a positive feedback cycle.","No-one has ever called me a cool dude. I'm somewhere between geek and normal.","In many cases, the user interface to a program is the most important part for a commercial company: whether the programs works correctly or not seems to be secondary.","When you say 'I wrote a program that crashed Windows,' people just stare at you blankly and say 'Hey, I got those with the system, for free.'","Hey, I'm a good software engineer, but I'm not exactly known for my fashion sense. White socks and sandals don't translate to 'good design sense'.","The economics of the security world are all horribly, horribly nasty and are largely based on fear, intimidation and blackmail.","The thing I love about diving is the flowing feeling. I like a sport where the whole point is to move as little as humanly possible so your air supply will last longer. That's my kind of sport. Where the amount of effort spent is absolutely minimal.","A consumer doesn't take anything away: he doesn't actually consume anything. Giving the same thing to a thousand consumers is not really any more expensive than giving it to just one.","The thing with Linux is that the developers themselves are actually customers too: that has always been an important part of Linux.","I don't try to be a threat to MicroSoft, mainly because I don't really see MS as competition. Especially not Windows-the goals of Linux and Windows are simply so different.","I'm sitting in my home office wearing a bathrobe. The same way I'm not going to start wearing ties, I'm also not going to buy into the fake politeness, the lying, the office politics and backstabbing, the passive aggressiveness, and the buzzwords.","I don't expect to go hungry if I decide to leave the University. Resume: Linux looks pretty good in many places.","I spend a lot more time than any person should have to talking with lawyers and thinking about intellectual property issues.","I don't see myself as a visionary at all.","I've actually found the image of Silicon Valley as a hotbed of money-grubbing tech people to be pretty false, but maybe that's because the people I hang out with are all really engineers.","I personally think of Linux development as being pretty non-localized, and I work with all the people entirely over e-mail - even if they happen to be working in the Portland area.","Part of doing Linux was that I had to communicate a lot more instead of just being a geek in front of a computer.","What I find most interesting is how people really have taken Linux and used it in ways and attributes and motivations that I never felt.","The cyberspace earnings I get from Linux come in the format of having a Network of people that know me and trust me, and that I can depend on in return.","To be honest, the fact that people trust you gives you a lot of power over people. Having another person's trust is more powerful than all other management techniques put together.","Linux has definitely made a lot of sense even in a purely materialistic sense.","Turtles are very stable and have been around forever. But they have problems adapting. When humans came along, turtles came under serious threat. Biodiversity is good, and I think it is good in technology as well.","Artists usually don't make all that much money, and they often keep their artistic hobby despite the money rather than due to it.","Before the commercial ventures, Linux tended to be rather hard to set up, because most of the developers were motivated mainly by their own interests.","Finnish companies tend to be very traditional, not taking many risks. Silicon Valley is completely different: people here really live on the edge.","Helsinki isn't all that bad. It's a very nice city, and it's cold really only in wintertime.","Helsinki may not be as cold as you make it out to be, but California is still a lot nicer. I don't remember the last time I couldn't walk around in shorts all day.","I do get my pizzas paid for by Linux indirectly.","I like to think that I've been a good manager. That fact has been very instrumental in making Linux a successful product.","I never felt that the naming issue was all that important, but I was obviously wrong, judging by how many people felt. I tell people to call it just plain Linux and nothing more.","I try to avoid long-range plans and visions - that way I can more easily deal with anything new that comes up.","I used to be interested in Windows NT, but the more I see it, the more it looks like traditional Windows with a stabler kernel. I don't find anything technically interesting there.","I very seldom worry about other systems. I concentrate pretty fully on just making Linux the best I can.","I'm generally a very pragmatic person: that which works, works.","I've been employed by the University of Helsinki, and they've been perfectly happy to keep me employed and doing Linux.","I've never regretted not making Linux shareware: I really don't like the pay for use binary shareware programs.","In my opinion MS is a lot better at making money than it is at making good operating systems.","Making Linux GPL'd was definitely the best thing I ever did.","Non-technical questions sometimes don't have an answer at all.","People enjoy the interaction on the Internet, and the feeling of belonging to a group that does something interesting: that's how some software projects are born.","Shareware tends to combine the worst of commercial software with the worst of free software.","What commercialism has brought into Linux has been the incentive to make a good distribution that is easy to use and that has all the packaging issues worked out.","When it comes to software, I much prefer free software, because I have very seldom seen a program that has worked well enough for my needs, and having sources available can be a life-saver.","You won't get sued for anticompetitive behavior.","The memory management on the PowerPC can be used to frighten small children.","I don't think I'm unusual in preferring my laptop to be thin and light.","I want my office to be quiet. The loudest thing in the room - by far - should be the occasional purring of the cat.","I don't have any authority over Linux other than this notion that I know what I'm doing.","I'd much rather have 15 people arguing about something than 15 people splitting into two camps, each side convinced it's right and not talking to the other.","I see myself as a technical person who chose a great project and a great way of doing that project.","In many ways, I am very happy about the whole Linux commercial market because the commercial market is doing all these things that I have absolutely zero interest in doing myself.","I don't actually go to that many conferences. I do that a couple of times a year. Normally, I am not recognized; people don't throw their panties at me. I'm a perfectly normal person sitting in my den just doing my job.","Software patents, in particular, are very ripe for abuse. The whole system encourages big corporations getting thousands and thousands of patents. Individuals almost never get them.","There's innovation in Linux. There are some really good technical features that I'm proud of. There are capabilities in Linux that aren't in other operating systems.","I'm interested in Linux because of the technology, and Linux wasn't started as any kind of rebellion against the 'evil Microsoft empire.'","To be a nemesis, you have to actively try to destroy something, don't you? Really, I'm not out to destroy Microsoft. That will just be a completely unintentional side effect.","I've felt strongly that the advantage of Linux is that it doesn't have a niche or any special market, but that different individuals and companies end up pushing it in the direction they want, and as such you end up with something that is pretty balanced across the board.","If you start doing things because you hate others and want to screw them over, the end result is bad.","Every once in a while an issue comes up where I have to make a statement. I can't totally avoid all political issues, but I try my best to minimize them. When I do make a statement, I try to be fairly neutral.","I lose sleep if I end up feeling bad about something I've said. Usually that happens when I send something out without having read it over a few times, or when I call somebody names.","It's a personality trait: from the very beginning, I knew what I was concentrating on. I'm only doing the kernel - I always found everything around it to be completely boring."],"Linwood Barclay":["It's one thing, holding open the door for someone at a grocery store, or the library, or just about anyplace else. But the doughnut shop is a different thing altogether. This is a get-in-and-out-as-fast-as-you-can operation. There's no room for courtesy or chivalry here.","Once you come up with a premise, you have to work out how it all happened. It's a bit like coming up with a spectacular roof design first. Before you can get it up there, you need to build a solid foundation and supporting structure.","Once I have a hook I think has potential - enough to spin out more than a hundred thousand words, then I start turning my attention to characters. Who are these people? Why did this thing happen to them? But the hook always comes first.","Generally speaking, rural drivers are a much better behaved species than city drivers. I'm not sure whether they're intrinsically this way, or there are just fewer opportunities for them to do behave badly. You can't go around running red lights if there aren't any red lights to run.","Before I left the 'Star' last year to write books full-time, I welcomed catastrophe. It was material. Missed planes, broken pipes, dead lawns, digestive disorders, you name it, if it was something that had gone horribly wrong, it was worth banging out 600 words about.","These days, my subjects are murder and mayhem and other terrible things that happen to people - things that are even worse than cutting yourself shaving. And these are not the sorts of things you feel the need to experience before you write about them.","When I was in my early 20s, my dream was to write mystery novels. I wanted to do what my favourite crime writer, Ross Macdonald, did - crank out a book a year. The only problem - and it was a considerable one - was that I stank.","Even if I couldn't get my early novels published, I could still write. I went into newspapers, where I got paid to write every day. If there's a better school for would-be novelists, I don't know what it is.","My biggest complaint about drivers out in the country has tended to be that they're not in a great hurry to get where they're going. This is particularly true of old men wearing hats. If you get behind an old guy wearing a hat on a winding road, you might as well just phone ahead on your cell and tell your friends you're going to be late.","Facebook, from what I can tell, is the virtual equivalent of dropping into the homes of several million people, all of whom say at the same time: 'Hey! Let's set up the slide projector!'","Switching over to a hybrid car is one of those right things, but, unfairly or not, it still has a reputation among car enthusiasts as something you have to pedal really fast when you're on the ramp merging into traffic on the 401.","You always want to go out there with the best book possible, so I listen to what my editors say, and even if they don't know how to fix it, I always seem to find a way. 'Trust Your Eyes' is the best book I've written, and I don't know if I can do any better.","My life isn't much different than when I worked full time as a journalist.","Crime fiction makes money. It may be harder for writers to get published, but crime is doing better than most of what we like to call CanLit. It's elementary, plot-driven, character-rich story-telling at its best.","I was born in Darien, Connecticut, but in 1959, when I was four, my parents moved to the suburbs of Toronto. Then, in the late 1960s, they bought a cottage in a resort/trailer park in the Kawarthas region of Ontario, and we moved up there. I wrote a book about it in 2000 called 'Last Resort: Coming of Age in Cottage Country.'","We're half an hour from Toronto, which offers everything you could want from a city, and a couple of hours from beautiful vacation country. We have it all here, plus George W. Bush is not our president.","I was filling entire school notebooks with stories by Grade 3. Of course, they were double-spaced, and the handwriting was huge.","Some authors, when starting a novel, imagine a place first. Others, a character starts taking shape in their head. I start with a hook, a situation, a 'what if.'","Al Gore, the former vice-president of the United States, lives in a mansion that uses more electricity than the average family's bungalow! David Suzuki rides on a bus that uses more fuel than a Smart car to get across Canada! Oh my God! And this is just the tip of the vanishing iceberg!"],"Lion Feuchtwanger":["An action doesn't have to be wrong just because it is not logical. It doesn't have to be right just because it has its logic.","There's only a step from the sublime to the ridiculous, but there's no road leading from the ridiculous to the sublime.","From depicting the past, so goes the suspicion, it is a short step to glorifying the past.","What is a historian, anyway? It is someone who uses facts to record the development of humanity.","I should add that it is open to debate whether what we call the writing of history these days is truly scientific.","Like the philosopher, the author views his task as one of establishing a clear connection between life and history, and of making the past bear fruit for the present and future.","Ever since my youth it has disturbed me that of the literary works that survived their own epoch, so many dealt with historical rather than contemporary subjects.","Asking the author of historical novels to teach you about history is like expecting the composer of a melody to provide answers about radio transmission.","I have always made an effort to render every detail of my reality with the greatest accuracy; but I have never paid attention to whether my presentation of historical facts was an exact one.","Both the historian and the novelist view history as the struggle of a tiny minority, able and determined to make judgments, which is up against a vast and densely packed majority of the blind, who are led by their instincts and unable to think for themselves.","After closely examining my conscience, I venture to state that in my historical novels I intended the content to be just as modern and up-to-date as in the contemporary ones.","An author who sets about to depict events of the past that have run their course is suspected of wishing to avoid the problems of the present day, of being, in other words, a reactionary."],"Lionel Barber":["In hindsight, Watergate was a curse as well as a blessing for American journalism. The courageous reporting of the 'Post' and the 'New York Times' - coupled with the favourable Supreme Court rulings on publication of the Pentagon Papers - were landmarks for the interpretation of First Amendment rights and the freedom of the press.","The advent of the Internet exposed the fact that the old business model for newspapers was broken. The world wide web fundamentally changed the media eco-system, challenging established journalistic practice in what is known as the mainstream media: radio, television, newspapers and magazines.","We don't need to update the paper through the night, so we don't need so many people working anti-social hours producing a newspaper for real-time news. That's the equivalent of the steam age.","Our U.S. audience is composed of globally-minded Americans, an elite category, the ones who do have passports, the decision-makers, senior ranks in the administration, senators on Capitol Hill.","While the web is very much the first draft of history, a rough-cut, it still has to be good journalism, well-sourced, reliable. Clearly, the printed form is going to have more effort put into it, going to be more reflective and relevant.","By using our international network, utilising templates and thinking ahead with pre-planned pages that contain carefully selected relevant news, we can deliver stories that other people just don't have. And that will release resources for the web.","My father was a journalist for 50 years in Leeds and Fleet Street. I thought about a career in business to show I could do something different, but the reaction among prospective employers was, shall we say, underwhelming.","I walk into the office at Southwark Bridge every morning, and I have no idea what's going to happen.","All our reporters and editors now work seamlessly in print and online. This integration has transformed the way we work. I believe this is vital to the success and growth of newspapers.","There were always plenty of newspapers in the house. 'The Times', 'Guardian', 'Daily Telegraph' and 'Daily Mail' were all regular fixtures on the coffee table. I used to enjoy reading 'The Times' editorial pages and the 'Daily Mail' sports pages.","My own special relationship with America began at an early age. My father, a fellow journalist, named me after Franklin Delano Roosevelt.","The post-war American newsroom resembled a vast factory churning out multiple editions through the night. Reporters spent days, sometimes weeks, on a single story.","Thanks to social media such as Facebook and Twitter, a far wider range of people take part in gathering, filtering and distributing news.","There is no conflict between best in British class and being a global newspaper. We are an international newspaper rooted in the City of London, and I think people understand that. The 'FT' stands out as a global niche product.","As a cub reporter, I devoured books about journalism.","In the summer of 2009, I modestly predicted that most major news organisations would be charging for content within 12 months. Charging, I argued, would not only plug the revenue gap; it would also help to re-establish value in their news product.","For the BBC and others, a free website is an obvious and relatively cheap addendum to their main purpose of streaming news and entertainment on screen to a mass audience."],"Lionel Barrymore":["I can remember when nobody believed an actor and didn't care what he believed.","Half the people in Hollywood are dying to be discovered and the other half are afraid they will be.","I've got a lot of ham in me.","This is the age of insincerity. The movies had the misfortune to come along in the twentieth century, and because they appeal to the masses there can be no sincerity in them.","Hollywood is tied hand and foot to the demands for artificiality of the masses all over the world."],"Lionel Blue":["Old friends die on you, and they're irreplaceable. You become dependent.","Praying privately in churches, I began to discover that heaven was my true home and also that it was here and now, woven into this life.","I was not allowed a physical lover. Falling in love with Love was the best I could get.","My mother enjoyed old age, and because of her I've begun to enjoy parts of it too. So far I've had it good and am crumbling nicely.","I began to see that my problems, seen spiritually, were really my soul's plusses.","I learnt pity, sympathy, and what it was like to be at the other end of the stick. Such lessons can't be learnt in lecture halls.","Early on I saw the repression and idolatry of Stalinism, and when it cracked, I was open to religion again.","Someone gave me a New Testament. I had never before read it systematically. Some parts made sense, some parts shocked me.","My mother was a modern woman with a limited interest in religion. When the sun set and the fast of the Day of Atonement ended, she shot from the synagogue like a rocket to dance the Charleston.","Good things come, and I'm not just referring to riding the buses.","Because of my Marxism, I was not into myths or miracles, whether it was the virgin birth, the physical resurrection or casting out demons from an epileptic.","An aged rabbi, crazed with liberalism, once said to me, We Jews are just ordinary human beings. Only a bit more so!","To change, to convert? Why bother?","I literally fell among Quakers when I went up to Oxford.","I was certainly open for something being on the edge of a nervous breakdown, perplexed by my own sexuality. I was gay.","I found that when I did something for the sake of heaven, heaven happened. These things changed my life. I owe them to my encounter with Christianity.","The real evidence for Jesus and Christianity is in how Jesus and the Christianity based on him manifest themselves in the lives of practicing Christians.","It was admitted by the early rabbis that the sectarians could be as full of good works as eggs were full of meat.","In speaking of Jesus, I must speak about Christianity because I do not think it possible or profitable to divide the two.","The real evidence is not practically speaking in scholarship but in how Jesus and the Christianity based on him manifest themselves in the lives of practising Christians. Their lives are the proofs of their beliefs.","During the Second World War, evacuated to non-Jewish households, I encountered Christianity at home and in school.","The Christian use of religion as a personal love affair both shocked me, and attracted me.","At religious instruction classes, I encountered The Pilgrims Progress by John Bunyan, and the sincerity of the traveller in that book was overwhelming.","Christianity had two faces which bewildered me - two pictures which didn't fit.","For some years I deserted religion in favour of Marxism. The republic of goodness seemed more attainable than the Kingdom of God.","For a Christian, Jesus is the unique and only way that God has fully revealed himself. For a Jew this cannot be.","Some of the parables of the Kingdom made wonderful sense, but the exclusivity in the New Testament put me off.","I was not comfortable worshipping another Jew.","So many plusses, so many minuses.","I recovered my infant Judaism, but in a reformist version.","It is not possible to unknow what you do know - the result of that is fanaticism.","I have ended as a Reform Rabbi, grateful to Christianity for so many good things.","I still go to a Christian priory for retreats.","I have begun to sympathetically understand Paul, though I don't like him much.","I feel that the Christian experience and the Jewish one have much to give each other. If this open society continues and there is no return to political anti-Semitism, then this encounter, deeper than any theology, may happen.","For a devotee or lover, the being, worshipped or loved, will always be the only one for her or him.","To my surprise, my 70s are nicer than my 60s and my 60s than my 50s, and I wouldn't wish my teens and 20s on my enemies.","It's more fun to watch without joining in.","On the way to work good-hearted young girls sometimes offer me their seats, which I accept and bless them in return, a transaction satisfying to all concerned.","I am pleased now that I have lived in a gay as well as a religious ghetto, though it hasn't been very comfortable. Taken together, their limitations cancel each other out and I have seen the world more kindly and more honestly.","The secular world is more spiritual than it thinks, just as the ecclesiastical world is more materialist than it cares to acknowledge.","Pious XII was too neutral to mention the gas chambers; decent people like my own family were turned into devils by crude Christianity.","I thought of such Christian inventions as the ghetto and the Jewish badge of shame. The Nazis didn't have to go very far to pick up their know-how.","Discrimination against Jews can be read in Thomas Aquinas, and insults against Jews in Martin Luther.","This Christian poison hasn't stopped yet.","What would I have done if I'd been put to the test? Would I have risked my own life for people I hardly knew? Probably, I would have looked the other way at best or become another apologist for evil at worst.","I didn't want to be on the losing side. I was fed up with Jewish weakness, timidity and fear. I didn't want any more Jewish sentimentality and Jewish suffering. I was sickened by our sad songs."],"Lionel Ferbos":["I've had a wonderful life with music.","As long as I have teeth, I'll keep playing. You can't play trumpet without teeth."],"Lionel Hampton":["Gratitude is when memory is stored in the heart and not in the mind.","Seemed to me that drumming was the best way to get close to God.","Playing is my way of thinking, talking, communicating.","Music was our wife, and we loved her. And we stayed with her, and we clothed her, and we put diamond rings on her hands.","I think I love it more as I get older because I keep getting better on drums, vibes and piano.","The secret is keeping busy, and loving what you do.","I worked hard learning harmony and theory when I was growing up in Chicago in the 1920s.","Working with Benny was important for me and for black musicians in general.","I feel honored to have been a part of that dramatic change.","Black and white players hadn't appeared together in public before Teddy Wilson and I began working with B.G.","Every day I look forward to getting with my instruments, trying new things.","Playing gives me as much good feeling now as it did when I was a bitty kid.","So I always figured I'd still be playing at this age."],"Lionel Jospin":["If French is no longer the language of a power, it can be the language of a counter power.","I remain attached to my nation.","Co-operation between governments still plays an important role and will remain indispensable.","I do not separate France from Europe.","I would like to see capital punishment suppressed in all democracies.","The fight against terror is a common imperative for democracies and must become so for all nations.","We must lead in a different way... We must have an active president, who gives strong direction and works with the government for its implementation."],"Lionel Messi":["You have to fight to reach your dream. You have to sacrifice and work hard for it.","I prefer to win titles with the team ahead of individual awards or scoring more goals than anyone else. I'm more worried about being a good person than being the best football player in the world. When all this is over, what are you left with? When I retire, I hope I am remembered for being a decent guy.","There are more important things in life than winning or losing a game.","There's nothing more satisfying than seeing a happy and smiling child. I always help in any way I can, even if it's just by signing an autograph. A child's smile is worth more than all the money in the world.","You have to show up in the World Cup, and in the World Cup anything can happen.","Sometimes you have to accept you can't win all the time.","I always thought I wanted to play professionally, and I always knew that to do that I'd have to make a lot of sacrifices. I made sacrifices by leaving Argentina, leaving my family to start a new life. I changed my friends, my people. Everything. But everything I did, I did for football, to achieve my dream.","I repeat what I always say: I want the best for Argentina in every way. I never try to make trouble for anybody.","What I do is play soccer, which is what I like.","The truth is that I don't have a favourite goal. I remember important goals more than I do favourite goals, like goals in the Champions League where I had the opportunity to have scored in both finals I have played in. Finals in the World Cup or Copa del Rey are the ones that have stayed with me for longer or that I remember more.","I'm lucky to be part of a team who help to make me look good, and they deserve as much of the credit for my success as I do for the hard work we have all put in on the training ground.","Money is not a motivating factor. Money doesn't thrill me or make me play better because there are benefits to being wealthy. I'm just happy with a ball at my feet. My motivation comes from playing the game I love. If I wasn't paid to be a professional footballer I would willingly play for nothing.","In football as in watchmaking, talent and elegance mean nothing without rigour and precision.","The day you think there is no improvements to be made is a sad one for any player.","I never think about the play or visualize anything. I do what comes to me at that moment. Instinct. It has always been that way.","I have fun like a child in the street. When the day comes when I'm not enjoying it, I will leave football.","Today I am the happiest man in the world, my son was born and thanks to God for this gift.","I am competitive and I feel bad when we lose. You can see it in me when we've lost. I'm in a bad way. I don't like to talk to anyone.","When the year starts the objective is to win it all with the team, personal records are secondary.","Whether it's a friendly match, or for points, or a final, or any game - I play the same. I'm always trying to be my best, first for my team, for myself, for the fans, and to try and win.","I've always really just liked football, and I've always devoted a lot of time to it. When I was a kid, my friends would call me to go out with them, but I would stay home because I had practice the next day.","I've never stopped being Argentine, and I've never wanted to. I feel very proud of being Argentine, even though I left there. I've been clear about this since I was very young, and I never wanted to change.","We will not take Arsenal lightly for one minute, as they showed in the two matches against us last season that they can be dangerous opponents if we lose our concentration for a moment.","On a personal note, I think it won't be until after I've retired that I'm fully aware of what I've done or what I've gone on to achieve in my career.","I've never stopped being Argentine, and I've never wanted to. I feel very proud of being Argentine, even though I left there. I've been clear about this since I was very young, and I never wanted to change. Barcelona is my home because both the club and the people here have given me everything, but I won't stop being Argentine.","Being named among the best at something is special and beautiful. But if there are no titles, nothing is won.","It seems like people want to blame me for everything. Whenever any issue arises, I'm said to have been involved even if I've had nothing to do with it. That's why I always focus on what I know, which is playing football, and try to be very careful with what I say because people always try and twist things.","You cannot allow your desire to be a winner to be diminished by achieving success before and I believe there is room for improvement in every sportsman.","Every year I try to grow as a player and not get stuck in a rut. I try to improve my game in every way possible. But that trait is not something I've worked on, it's part of me.","For my part, I try to do my bit to make people's lives more bearable, in particular children across the globe who are having problems.","I have many years to get better and better, and that has to be my ambition. The day you think there is no improvements to be made is a sad one for any player.","It's not so easy for us when we play teams who have a different mindset, like Chelsea or Inter Milan, because they have the intention of trying to stop us rather than playing a game that is more attractive for the spectators to enjoy.","Like I've said many times before, I'm always more likely to remember goals for their importance rather than if they're beautiful or not. Goals scored in finals, for example.","I've always really just liked football, and I've always devoted a lot of time to it. When I was a kid, my friends would call me to go out with them, but I would stay home because I had practice the next day. I like going out, but you have to know when you can and when you can't.","The truth is my idea has been to always stay at Barcelona and see out the rest of my career here. Like I always say, one doesn't know what can happen in the future, but if it were up to me to decide, I would stay at Barcelona for the rest of my career.","Nah, I've always had a great relationship with my two brothers, I have always had their support in my football and in everything. They've been very close to me and we have a great relationship.","I want to concentrate on winning things with Barcelona and Argentina. Then if people want to say nice things about me when I have retired, great. Right now, I need to concentrate on being part of a team - not just on me.","It's scoring goals that's great, whether against Brazil or anybody else."],"Lionel Murphy":["Where there is a will there is a way. And this must be the way not of compulsion but of cooperation... No government and no plan can succeed without it.","It is a great privilege for any man to become a member of the Senate.","We are deeply conscious of the fact that our north and west must be developed.","The people of Australia would be staggered to learn that Australia has no national development plan.","The Menzies Government, by its participation in the plans for the development of other nations, can see the virtue of planning for them but apparently cannot see the virtue of a plan for Australia.","We must have as clear a picture as we can of the Australia that we want to achieve at the end of that time.","There are no insuperable constitutional difficulties.","The Australian people want to help build this country into a great nation. This budget... has not realized the capacity of the Australian people. It has underestimated them. It has let us down."],"Lionel Richie":["I think the whole world is dying to hear someone say, 'I love you.' I think that if I can leave the legacy of love and passion in the world, then I think I've done my job in a world that's getting colder and colder by the day.","Taking time to sit back and watch and think about what you've seen is important. Traveling did a great deal to me. I found that when I travel and just sit in the corner and watch, a million ideas come to me.","When I was growing up, music was music and there were no genres. We didn't look at it as country music. Popular music in Tuskegee was country music. So I didn't know it in categories. It was the radio.","Greatness comes from fear. Fear can either shut us down and we go home, or we fight through it.","Country music has always been about as close to R&B as you can possibly get. We're storytellers.","The best compliment that has ever been given to me was, I was at the airport one day and a guy came in and said, 'Lionel, my wife loves you, the kids love you, my mother-in-law loves you, the family loves you.'","I always like to challenge myself. I never want to be put into a box.","Believe me, I love commerce as much as the rest of the readers of 'Businessweek.' But in art, you have to be true to yourself and your musical vision. People have known me well for a long time, so if I was chasing a trend and doing something that wasn't authentic to who I am, they would know it in just a few seconds.","So much of my career has been about saying things the way people say them, using melodies not that I can sing but that the people can sing.","I find the greatest songs in the world come out of pain, and I don't like it! Here's what it does: It strips away all of your facade. It makes you so honest. It's cleansing.","Exactly when people are in turmoil is the time that the entertainment business has always been at its best. Because people don't want to be reminded every day that they are under siege, or that they're not having a great time of life.","Just when I think it couldn't get any bigger, 'Tuskegee' reaches a new level of success.","Kids will keep it real. If I've ever had in my life a great anchor, it's them. They get in your head, 'don't get too famous.' If you think you're really famous and think you're really hip, go hang out with your kids for an afternoon. That's about as earthbound as it's going to get.","By growing up in Alabama, I had a melting pot of the whole pie: R&B, gospel, country.","All artists are egotistical maniacs with inferiority complexes.","I want to let everybody know that I'm from there, and country is Tuskegee. Or should I say rather, my country is Tuskegee. I was born and raised there, it's not just someplace I passed through one day.","People, as critical as it looks, we're OK. We are in control, whether we feel it or not.","Lionel Richie, love song, OK, thank you very much, good-bye. And all of a sudden I realized that, in my career, what has made my career has always been the surprises.","It's quite interesting that in my growing up I had several influences. We had gospel music on campus. R&B music was, of course, the community, and radio was country music. So I can kind of see where all the influences came from.","It was very interesting in my world, because I grew up as a fan and I did not know that there was a thing called R&B, pop, country, classical - I just knew that I loved music.","'Let the music play on' would be my legacy.","When I came up with the idea for 'Tuskegee,' I didn't want to be confined by boundaries of age, genre or demographics. I am thrilled with how well this album has been received by people from all walks of life. It is truly living up to the vision we had when we created it.","I knew I was going to do a country album one day. But I was just trying to figure out for the life of me, what we were going to do to make it different, unique.","You cannot beat the feeling of sitting on top of the charts. I had almost forgotten what it feels like... It feels great! It is really a very exciting time and I am enjoying the ride.","Your kids can say some cruel things to you at times. For example, Nicole, Miles and Sofie are standing there in the room and I'm dressed to kill in my own mind. They'll say to me, 'Dad, you're not going out there looking like that are you?' If that doesn't kill a star, I don't know what does!","I find myself going out on the road to get my confidence back, because I lose it at home.","I grew up with the Grand Ole Opry, Dottie West, Conway Twitty, Buck Owens... not realizing it was influencing me as much as it was.","Country is bringing in a little rock element... a little '80s element. Melody is king now. But its just in the music, its not so much in the songwriting, which is still very basic to the storytelling aspect of it.","I just like people. I'll hold a conversation at a gas station. It's not about the fame and the fortune, I just like people.","I'm a songwriter, and people will tell you the greatest stories about their lives, whether you want to hear it or not.","People have allowed me into their homes, through my words and my music.","I travel around the world, experiencing every language, every religion... some places where there's just no reason to smile, because their lives are so difficult.","I am a country boy and proud of it.","Growing up with country, R&B, gospel, and classical music from my grandmother and pop, Tuskegee was the perfect melting pot for my influences as a writer.","My earliest memories of country music are the Grand Ole Opry."],"Lionel Shriver":["Ever since Hiroshima, we've been faced with the depressing fact that you cannot un-invent something.","Donald Trump wouldn't work on paper. Obnoxious, crass, boastful, and vulgar, with garish tastes and a Stepford wife - as a fictional character, he'd seem too crudely drawn. Even in a trashy airport thriller, readers wouldn't buy such a boor as president.","I am hopeful that the concept of 'cultural appropriation' is a passing fad: people with different backgrounds rubbing up against each other and exchanging ideas and practices is self-evidently one of the most productive, fascinating aspects of modern urban life.","The daughter of an ordained minister, I had been forced to go to church since I was a toddler. I hated church and resented being forced to recite the Apostle's Creed, mumbling, 'I believe... ' when I didn't.","In the public mind, an investment banker is no longer conservative; he's a risk taker, a gambler in high stakes, not to mention a thief. These people are dangerous - deliciously so.","Over my lifetime, heavy usage has woefully eroded profanity's power.","Happiness isn't a position. It's a trajectory.","I am bowled over by the massive number of remarkable people who face down the fact that no, they are not going to be film directors, famous artists, or billionaire entrepreneurs and still come out the other side as cheerful, decent, gracious human beings.","A smaller waist is not the solution to all your problems.","As any traveller knows, heading elsewhere is one thing, getting back quite another.","Life's most underrated emotion is self-pity.","In the perfect world, no one would need pre-nups. But all too often, a misty-eyed romancer at the altar transforms into a vengeful, avaricious fiscal predator when the marriage goes south.","Dieting is odious and can require years of determination and sacrifice. I entirely understand the impulse to say, 'Screw it,' and have another piece of cake.","In Shaker Heights, Ohio, one of America's first planned communities, order and harmony are prized.","Authors are free to ignore their editors' advice. I often avail myself of this veto power - sometimes out of a pigheadedness for which I'll pay the price.","Writers who take on polarising issues are apt to step on a few toes.","At the keyboard, unrelenting anguish about hurting other people's feelings inhibits spontaneity and constipates creativity.","As a woman, I'd be uneasy about being given the power to determine what is insulting to women in general.","Jonathan Lethem's 10th novel, 'The Blot,' is engaging, entertaining, and sharp for its first two-thirds. Then it goes to hell.","What a good novelist does with a throwaway that serves no fictional purpose is throw it away.","Most books are three-thirds rubbish.","Reality doesn't have to be plausible. Reality can be as preposterous as it pleases.","A Trump presidency feels as if we've crawled between the covers of a really crummy book.","I can't be alone among fiction writers in regarding the world, so much weirder than anything we could make up, as beating us at our own game or in racking my brains over what could possibly constitute a contribution when novels pale before the newspaper.","We speak often of 'destroying the planet' when what we mean is destroying its habitability for humans.","I'm not a religious person. Chances are that the universe neither treasures nor regrets us.","When Truman Capote wrote from the perspective of condemned murderers from a lower economic class than his own, he had some gall. But writing fiction takes gall.","There was a point in the latter 1990s at which, suddenly, every sitcom and drama in sight had to have a gay or lesbian character or couple. That was good news as a voucher of the success of the gay rights movement, but it still grew a bit tiresome: 'Look at us! Our show is so hip, one of the characters is homosexual!'","Trump is not charismatic. He is artless and politically clumsy and wears his egotism on his sleeve.","Trump can't string a single grammatical sentence together, and at the podium, he is lumpen and awkward.","Novelists are too often assumed to write veiled autobiography.","We vainly fancy ourselves above the ugly informing and paranoia of the right-wing McCarthy era, but in the 21st century, the Left has fashioned a mirror image.","Overly vigorous investigations of ominously ill-defined 'bullying' can themselves constitute a form of bullying.","Hypersensitivity has become a weapon.","I was terrified of growing up to become the anti-me, maturing into a woman whom I would not recognise and who wouldn't recognise her younger self.","In my teens, I eyed my adulthood with trepidation, as if stalked by a stranger - one who would seize control as if by demonic possession and regard my fledgling incarnation with contempt.","As a teenager, I ached to grow up even more than I dreaded to. I craved escape from my parents' impositions on what I believed.","The financial industry may not be synonymous with economics, but it does control a large enough sector of the global economy to sink us all, as was unnervingly demonstrated in 2008.","For storytellers, financiers make ideal rogues. The easiest way to make characters unappealing is to make them rich - shorthand for spoiled, picky, superior, and cold-hearted.","While one can't always begrudge the wealth of people who have at least produced something of value, the rich of the financial world don't make anything but more money. They're not creative, aside from, perhaps, in accounting.","For the left-leaning, political identity is liable to be closely intertwined with personal identity. The left is collusive, if not presumptuous: should you get on well with leftists at a party, they will blithely assume that you share the same views on the invasion of Iraq, even if all you've talked about is the canapes.","Tory supporters are not spontaneously ashamed; they have been made to feel ashamed. British leftists fiercely believe they are right - in the sense of correct but also in the sense of just. Conservatives likewise believe they are right-as-in-correct. Yet Tories are less confident about whether their politics are right-as-in-just.","Conservative supporters might either have the courage of their convictions or, if truly ashamed, revise them, but they should at least refute the proposition that defending your own interests is only acceptable if you're broke.","Criminality being partially preordained may seem to let culprits off the hook. Yet it also makes the proclivity seem ineradicable and suggests that reform is unlikely: once a baddie, always a baddie.","Perhaps scientists will eventually discover that we are all clockwork bunnies, and our experience of volition is an electro-chemical illusion.","As individuals are best off believing they control their behaviour, the judiciary is best off imputing that control - barring powerful extenuating factors such as mental illness.","Beauty is aspirational - an ideal that mortals approach but seldom attain.","As a child, I was always a sucker for anything in miniature, and it didn't have to be a dress: a desk, a Matchbox truck. Perhaps a childhood attraction to shrunken but compellingly realistic facsimiles is commonplace, if only because children themselves are compellingly realistic facsimiles of the giants who rule their world.","The absence of doll babies in my toy chest didn't seriously influence my later decision not to become a mother; rather, I disdained Hasbro's Baby Alive wetting doll because I was already the kind of girl who would grow up to be childless by choice.","Set a good example as parents, since the most convincing argument that a girl can become a computer coder is that her mother is one.","In my country, we're sufficiently consumed by the concept of happiness that the right to its pursuit is enshrined in the Declaration of Independence. But what is happiness?","When we conceive of happiness as a static state, effectively a place toward which we are aimed but at which most of us will never feel we've quite arrived, then the vision becomes exclusionary.","A manuscript under way always gave me something to do; only while enduring the aimlessness between books was I truly glum.","Clearly, freedom does not extend to the right to harm other people.","Laws to protect 'public health' are potentially infinite, especially once they no longer have to be supported by any research whatsoever.","The dumbest childhood vow I ever made was to finish every book I started.","For pity's sake, if you don't take a shine to a novel, there are loads more in the world; read something else. Continue suffering, and it's not the author's fault. It's yours.","Reading time is precious. Don't waste it. Reading bad books, or books that are wrong for a certain time in your life, can dangerously turn you off the activity altogether.","The sign that I don't like the book I'm reading is finding myself watching reruns of 'Come Dine With Me.'","Hungry for both fantasy and inspiration, readers crave protagonists who, after overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles, triumph at the end of the day.","In the big picture, few of our careers live up to the dreams we nursed when we were young. In fact, one underside of success is that it's nearly always penultimate, and so every accomplishment merely raises the bar.","Letting ourselves down in some fashion is such an integral part of daily life that the paucity of literature on the subject is baffling.","Weight having become politicised, anyone with a profile in the media who either subscribes to or departs from the template of tininess implicitly represents a constituency, whether they want to or not.","Ironically, heavier comedians, actors, and the characters they play are actually more sympathetic, and easier for audiences to identify with, than the svelte.","Publishers like their authors to take advantage of publicity opportunities.","Most women work not from yearning for fulfilment but yearning to pay the mortgage.","'The Feminine Mystique' goads me to gratitude that, thanks to forerunners like Betty Friedan, I've had the opportunity to pursue a career.","I read 'The Bell Jar' as an adolescent and, like most teenagers, had no problem identifying with a young woman who had everything going for her - looks, talent, opportunity, with her 'whole life ahead of her,' yadda, yadda, yadda - yet was spiraling into misery.","In economics, 'competitiveness' does not describe Barack Obama's insistence on not only being president of the U.S. but also beating his staff at bowling.","I do occasionally encounter a British business that delivers what and when, and for exactly the price, they promised. But commercial paragons in the U.K. are rare.","Few Amazon punters will explore a book with the depth of an 800-word review.","Certainly, critics are not all created equal.","I might defend the reviewing trade, but a handful of haughty hired hands no longer having the last word on books is not a bad thing.","Some of the best scenes in drama take almost no time - helping to illustrate that life-changing events in real life often occur in a split second, after which nothing is ever the same.","During the protracted tooth-and-nail tussle between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primaries, I was one of those fierce partisans desperate for the first black candidate with a serious shot at the White House to win the nomination.","Ultimately, Hillary and Obama are on the same side.","In grad school, I took a workshop with Scott Spencer, whose excellent novel 'Endless Love' had just been turned into a film. We students were in awe of his prestige. Yet Scott himself was chagrined; for good reason, he hated the movie.","Awful film adaptations follow novelists for the rest of their lives. An atrocious movie of 'We Need to Talk About Kevin' could have stigmatised the book, aggrieved the novel's fans, and blighted my reputation forever.","My agent had warned that, while a fine film would do my profile a world of good, a bad one wouldn't help me at all, and I suspected she was soft-pedalling the latter possibility. The effect of a truly execrable adaptation is worse than neutral. The stink rubs off.","Though a fine writer, Scott Spencer will forever be associated with a cheesy, sentimental film starring the vapid box-office draw Brooke Shields.","The premiere of Lynne Ramsay's film of 'We Need To Talk About Kevin' at the Cannes film festival provides an apt juncture at which to celebrate the miraculous power - not of film but of fiction. Lo, I have created a monster.","Oddly, for a book to do well merely because people like it is surprisingly rare.","I owe thanks to a thoughtful, sophisticated readership hungry for challenging subject matter, for honest portrayals of parenthood, and for fiction whose meaning is neither obvious nor morally pat.","I'm sometimes asked if I get bored with talking about 'Kevin,' and of course, the short answer is yes. Nevertheless, after a long slog in the literary trenches, I never take a single reader for granted and always remind myself that for new readers the unfolding story is fresh.","I guess I understand a public intellectual to be somebody who moves public discourse forward: someone who either says something new or says something that everybody knows to be true but is afraid to express.","We probably give newspaper columnists too much weight.","I think Britain is a little better at bringing intellectuals into discourse than America, where I'm from. Though I would say, perhaps, that the U.K. prefers its intellectualism to be entertaining.","February is for curmudgeons, whinge-bags, and misanthropes. You can't begrudge us one month of the year or blame us for being even crabbier, it's so short. There is nothing good about it, which is why it's so great.","Formal declarations of mistrust, pre-nups are emotionally unfortunate. They overtly plan for failure, and thus involve a jarring cognitive dissonance.","However unattractive, pre-nups are at least a way round a law that dictates simply because you love someone and share their bed, that person has a claim on everything you own.","A pre-nup is an insurance policy or, in brokerage terms, a short hedge - meant to mitigate a high-risk investment. It safeguards the love-struck from their own poor judgment of character.","In the era of Venus Williams, girliness and goo isn't the way to every woman's heart. Yet publishers presume that women only buy a book that looks soft and that appears to be all about women, even if it isn't. Yet women, unlike men, buy books by and about both sexes.","When my novels are packaged as exclusively for women, I'm not only cut off from a vital portion of my audience but clearly labelled as an author the literary establishment is free to dismiss.","By stereotyping my work's audience as self-involved and prissy, women-only packaging also insults my readers, who could all testify that trussing up my novels as sweet, girly, and soft is like stuffing a Rottweiler in a dress.","Edith Wharton was a natural story-teller. As plots do in real life, hers flow directly from character. Her prose is so effortlessly elegant that you're rarely aware as they purl by that the sentences are so pretty. More concerned with what is put than how it is put, she also understood that you only say anything at all when you say it well.","I was born after the heavy spade work of female emancipation was done.","I have buckets of sympathy for the obese, often subject to cruelty, ridicule, denunciation, and contempt."],"Lionel Sosa":["Be proud of your Latino culture and do the best work you can do, and you will always succeed.","I can't imagine what this great country would be like if the Mexican Revolution hadn't happened.","Anger does not solve problems - anger only makes things worse. I go by the old saying, 'Don't make important decisions when you're angry.'","If you lose, you can't lead. If you don't lead, you're irrelevant. Winning is what it's all about in politics.","Latinos have enough voting power now to decide elections, and every smart politician knows this.We can't afford to give our vote to those who alienate us, but neither to those who take us for granted.","Remember that our Spanish conquerors, for their own benefit, deliberately created an oppressed underclass whose collective psyche became rooted in passivity and underachievement.","If college expectations are not taught at home, teach them in school.","The Latino vote has to be earned just like any other.","When I started Sosa & Associates, there were only 3 million Latinos in the U.S. and only four Hispanic-specialized marketing agencies.I had one little goal for our small San Antonio-based agency: to be the largest Hispanic-specialized agency in the United States. We planned for our success and achieved our goal.","I believe that we are missing a great opportunity. We as Republicans are not really emphasizing what brings us together, and that's conservative values: love of the country. Love of family. Personal responsibility. Hard work. Optimism. Those are the things that we should be communicating to Latinos, and we're doing that very poorly.","My guess is the great majority of teachers would welcome a system where innovation is embraced, where their hard work and their students' achievement are applauded and rewarded.","I'm able to utilize a lifetime of learning to help teach young people how to apply sound marketing strategy and principles for the purpose of growing the client's business. And for me, that's just too much fun.","When I say that Latinos share conservative values, when Ronald Reagan said that, we mean the love of family, the love of country, a commitment to personal responsibility, to hard work.","I've been a Republican all my life because I embrace the conservative values of hard work, personal freedom, less government and fewer taxes. But I also believe in compassion, inclusion, and helping those who want to help themselves.","Immigrants have always come into the country with low levels of education. Whether it's the Irish or Italian or Polish, here is the land of opportunity. It's where people come in at the bottom and build themselves up. To try to bring in people who have already made it is un-American.","The Republicans are, 'the party of the rich,' my mom said, 'We're poor, so we're Democrats.' That convinced me. I had no wish to remain poor, so I became a Republican at the age of 12.","When you're a Republican Latino, you're traveling uphill on a lonely road. Still, it's the road I prefer. It has led me to opportunity far beyond my dreams. I've worked on eight Republican presidential races, as well as for some of the world's largest corporations, all because the doors of opportunity, not the doors of welfare, were open to me.","Mexico is so close to us. No matter how long we stay here, we identify as Americans first, but we also have a place for our mother country. That is very visible in San Antonio.","We talk about what's important to Hispanics: education, family, creating an environment in which you can achieve what you want to achieve because there aren't going to be obstacles in your way.","I've been a Republican since age 13, when we got our first television set, and I saw the Republican National Convention on television. And President Eisenhower was talking about personal responsibility, about opening the door for opportunity and that people could really take care of themselves without a lot of government intrusions.","I don't think that the Democrats are doing anything right. They certainly haven't delivered on the promise of creating more jobs for Latinos. They have not delivered on the promise of bringing immigration reform up to the forefront. They had a sitting president; they had both houses of Congress. They could have done something, but they did nothing."],"Lionel Stander":["I am a professional performer and I only appear on TV for entertainment or for philanthropic organizations, and I consider this a very serious matter that doesn't fit into either category.","Anyone who lives within his means suffers from a lack of imagination."],"Lionel Trilling":["Where misunderstanding serves others as an advantage, one is helpless to make oneself understood.","We who are liberal and progressive know that the poor are our equals in every sense except that of being equal to us.","A primary function of art and thought is to liberate the individual from the tyranny of his culture in the environmental sense and to permit him to stand beyond it in an autonomy of perception and judgment.","We are at heart so profoundly anarchistic that the only form of state we can imagine living in is Utopian; and so cynical that the only Utopia we can believe in is authoritarian.","It is now life and not art that requires the willing suspension of disbelief.","Probably it is impossible for humor to be ever a revolutionary weapon. Candide can do little more than generate irony.","Our culture peculiarly honors the act of blaming, which it takes as the sign of virtue and intellect.","Immature artists imitate. Mature artists steal.","Youth is a time when we find the books we give up but do not get over.","The poet may be used as a barometer, but let us not forget that he is also part of the weather.","Being a Jew is like walking in the wind or swimming: you are touched at all points and conscious everywhere.","The function of literature, through all its mutations, has been to make us aware of the particularity of selves, and the high authority of the self in its quarrel with its society and its culture. Literature is in that sense subversive.","Every neurosis is a primitive form of legal proceeding in which the accused carries on the prosecution, imposes judgment and executes the sentence: all to the end that someone else should not perform the same process.","The immature artist imitates. Mature artists steal.","What marks the artist is his power to shape the material of pain we all have.","This is the great vice of academicism, that it is concerned with ideas rather than with thinking.","There is no connection between the political ideas of our educated class and the deep places of the imagination.","The poet is in command of his fantasy, while it is exactly the mark of the neurotic that he is possessed by his fantasy.","We are all ill: but even a universal sickness implies an idea of health.","It is possible that the contemplation of cruelty will not make us humane but cruel; that the reiteration of the badness of our spiritual condition will make us consent to it."],"Lisa Ann Walter":["If wearing the Spanx helps you get looks, and you feel that energy and response, and you're rocking your body with confidence, that's still how you'll feel about yourself when you get home and take the Spanx off... If your attitude improves from the Spanx, wear the Spanx!","I've been in television for a little bit, and when people are attracted to what you've created, you get very excited because of the numbers. The business side is very exciting.","There are temptations around you all the time. The trick is to work your way through anxiety or your tiredness or whatever, and not let yourself get so hungry that you're going and stopping for the burgers, and you don't view it as reward. You're doing better for yourself is eating better food.","I danced growing up. I had two friends of mine that, actually, one of them wound up dancing with Alvin Ailey.","We all hate on ourselves way too much, and there are so many people who think they have to look like those women on TV. That's so unreasonable. Everybody is supposed to be a different size. And if I can just be confident in myself, then I'll look better. It's quantum physics!","I will never be able to fix myself enough to the point I like myself, so I just jumped to the point where I said, 'I like myself as I am.'","Basically, in our society, you can never fix anything enough. The minute you get your head above water about one thing, they let you know that 12 other things about you suck. It's like playing 'Self-Esteem Whack-A-Mole.'","When my marriage broke up... I had just put on 45 pounds for my 'Shall We Dance?' character. I had to eat 10,000 calories a day just to put on weight while training with Tony Dovolani. I basically stayed in bed for a six-month rotation of depression naps. Dance helped me lose the weight."],"Lisa Blatt":["I've learned that the Court will continue to change the meaning of the Constitution. Although all of the Justices have expressed the importance of judicial restraint, the Court inevitably makes new law every time it interprets the Constitution.","The Courtroom is a battlefield, and oral argument requires a fair amount of verbal jousting and sparring with the Justices.","It's a zero sum game: the Court either expands individual rights or expands the government's right to regulate individuals.","I've heard countless women - but not a single man - say to me, 'I could never stand up before the Supreme Court; it would be way too stressful.' But I've heard countless men, and very few women, say to me, 'I would love to argue in front of the Court; that would be so exciting.'","Every woman who has left and gone into private practice has done fabulously. So the question is why aren't more women drawn to this field? It's helpful to enjoy the art of advocacy - verbal combat or verbal jousting. I find it telling that so many woman might be horrified, and you know, wouldn't want to do it.","Clients trust you to represent their interest in the highest court.","My nine-year-old was trying to read my spiel. When she tried to pronounce the word 'pharmaceutical,' it was frightening. She would love to argue in the Supreme Court one day. My son asked me, 'Mommy, why do you have to have so many arguments? Why can't you have agreements?'","Some women tend to sell themselves short. I've only ever had women say to me, 'I could never argue in the Supreme Court!' Do you think a man has ever said that to me? Of course not.","For me, it's all about channeling the mistakes I've made and just saying all the things I wish somebody had said to me. I say to boys as much as girls: You've got to hold your chest high, and no matter what, you don't let the other side intimidate you.","That's the best part of being in private practice, by the way: being able to say whatever I want. In the government I couldn't talk to reporters and couldn't speak to the public, and now I just feel free. I have a First Amendment right again, and I exercise it daily.","I don't think anyone would describe me as an understated advocate. Several people have told me my argument style is very direct and very blunt, which I find mystifying. How could you ever be anything but direct and blunt?","The Supreme Court is not the impetus for constitutional change - we are.","But the Supreme Court does not make sweeping changes in constitutional law by accident, or by its own design. Rather, the Court is limited to deciding the cases that the parties ask the Court to decide.","In terms of style, the best advocates are relaxed, clear, in control, and confident. They embrace the hard questions with gusto. But no matter how hard you prepare, it's impossible to prepare for every conceivable question."],"Lisa Bonet":["We're getting ready to take over the world. My group of girlfriends - we're renegades.","Both of my parents would say they were atheists, so where I inherited my connection to God I don't know. But it's natural. No Bible, no Torah, just the love religion.","It's from our sufferings that we form our consciousness.","I felt devalued and disrespected. The energy behind it felt disingenuous and motivated by corporate profit.","When I was 16 I was fortunate enough to get Cosby and move to New York and shift my whole life. that had been my dream all along, and it came true.","I'm part of an important movement that needs to happen.","Prisons are like the concentration camps of our time. So many go in and never come out, and primarily they're black and Latino.","I spent a lot of time feeling alienated and rejected.","What saddens me is the corruption of youth and beauty, and the loss of soul, which is only replaced by money.","Having a mate has given me that feeling of safety.","An instructor once told me that when there's resistence in your body, it's only because of the resistence in your mind. It's about getting inside the pose. Being the breath.","I have a desire to create more film, more beauty, more art, more love, but I don't feel desperate. It's not about creating or building a career.","My life is art. Its how I express God.","A group of us started a community center in Santa Monica. We've tried different programs, and three have worked really well. A poetry group. Once a week we visit Venice High and talk to girls at risk.","Everyone has their story. Everyone has issues. You have to face your fears.","Having Zoe saved my life. It was my wake-up call. There were so many things I didn't want to pass on to her.","I took solace in my relationship with God who, along with my dog, was my best friend growing up.","I was literally the black sheep of the family, and there were definitely moments of discomfort while my grandmother was working through her racism.","I work with youth offenders in LA, I've heard them speak and see how music manipulates them.","I'm writing a film. With our access to these powerful media, we're going to take over, because it's really disgusting what is put out there now to be consumed.","It's okay to be a freak.","Let those who know know, and let me keep what little privacy I can.","My desire to participate in the business is not to make more crap.","My mother, brave woman, lost her whole family when she decided to marry a black man in the '60s. When the marriage fell apart, she had to come back to her family.","Once a week we go to juvenile hall and talk to boys there. Just go and spend a day in the juvenile courts.","Success made me self-sufficient, but it also took away my anonymity. I'm just this quiet nobody, and all of a sudden people are nervous around me. That was kind of weird.","That industry expects you to prove yourself over and over again. Do I stay doing this, or do I raise my daughter and live surrounded by people who love me? Wasn't even really a choice.","The Cosby years were a major part of my life, but it is the past; I don't really concentrate on it.","We use a Native American tradition of the talking stick. You sit and pass it around and whoever has the stick has to talk. Some people just hold it. Others really share.","I was obsessed with the Olympics. It's so exciting to see that level of excellence and endurance.","I'm a shy person. I don't know if it's in my DNA to share with the world."],"Lisa Caputo":["I'm happy to tell you that my debt is retired. That happened because I got a good financial adviser.","Go out and interview people to find a partner whom you can trust. Find somebody who subscribes to the same view that you do. I'm happy to tell you that I practice what I preach. I would have never thought I'd end up in financial services.","Don't be like my mother when my father had a heart attack. My mother had never handled the finances. I don't ever want to see anybody go through that. Women shouldn't be in that position.","Go out and interview people to find a partner whom you can trust. Find somebody who subscribes to the same view that you do. I'm happy to tell you that I practice what I preach. I would have never thought I'd end up in financial services. I'm happy to tell you that my debt is retired. That happened because I got a good financial adviser.","I have to give a lot of credit to Sandy Weill, because he gets it. He gets the power of the women's contribution to the economy.","Citigroup has the opportunity to be the largest financial institution and to serve us well. What we decide to do is not what everybody else does. Other companies sponsor women's events and put a woman's face in advertising. This is financial services wrapped in pink."],"Lisa Cholodenko":["I was a student at SF State, and I honestly didn't know where I was headed. I thought maybe something in the social sciences. But I happened to be living with a group of people, and one person was a film student. I was always keen on and aware of what she was doing.","I get asked why there aren't more female directors all the time. I'm kind of reluctant to talk about it. That's not because I think the question is irrelevant or stupid. It's just that there are so many mitigating factors.","I think invariably when you are dealing with relationships, the films really center on that, and the plot is really born out of that. That's the most core part of a relationship: intimacy, I think, whether it's expressed or not.","There is a core value I wanted to illuminate: No matter what kind of family you have - straight, gay, married, single parent, separated, no kids, two kids, 20 kids, whatever - we all go through the human comedy. But if the bonds are strong enough, and the desire is there, you can get to the other side, still together and still a family.","Everyone on the planet has a dark and a light. That's a multi-dimensional character.","This whole Oscar thing is so political. It's about how much a film grosses, and who's in it, and how well it has been promoted.","I had a nutty career. I was living in New York. Then I got to an age where my friends and sister were having children, and I started to think I needed to orient myself towards a world where it could happen.","L.A. is conventional to a hyper-real degree. It's plastic.","There's a lot of technology out there to help people have children in different ways, and later in life, for better or worse.","I think I'm interested in these kinds of character dramas, psychological dramas, domestic dramas, whatever you want to call them - comedy dramas.","Making the choice to cast someone in a lead role is a big one. You don't want to squander your opportunity.","I'm in my mid-40s now, and I came out in 11th grade, so I must have been 17. So that's quite a long time ago, and the temperature and the culture was different.","I had a great love affair in high school and let myself have that love affair and tried to keep it to myself.","I've done episodic television and some other things that have been written by other people.","I have enjoyed writing my own stuff, and it's been a privilege to be able to scrap some money together to be able to make films from my own scripts.","I feel like if you feel good about a script, and you feel confident about your ability to direct and just capture it right, it's all just, really, really in your favor there.","If you write something that's personal, there's going to be elements of yourself in it.","Not only does Annette Bening have a really lovely, deep voice, but she's also a great articulator. I think I'm more of a mumbler.","I feel like I've been observed as an individual more than a gay person, or as a filmmaker with a certain point of view rather than a lesbian filmmaker with a gay point of view.","I have a deal with HBO to develop television, and I am also developing a movie called 'The Abstinence Teacher,' which is based on a book by Tom Perrotta.","I don't feel like my films are about gender; they are about identity - but a different slant on identity.","I don't know if my films are about women in a kind of frolicking - here's a grab bag of women's issues. They are about women of substance with very particular stories.","I was going through some stressful stuff, and I lost feeling in my face and in my tongue. So I went to a doctor. He said he didn't think I had MS or a brain tumor. He said, 'I think you're just stressed out.'","I had pretty cool parents. Still do.","The source of so much of my anxiety in life and the tensions in my relationship is my anxiety about my kid. It's all very abstract and unfounded and ungrounded.","In June 2002, I had just finished 'Laurel Canyon' and decided to move back to Los Angeles after nearly a decade in New York. Post-9/11 New York felt different.","Wendy and I both wanted kids, but since we were pushing 40, the clock was ticking.","In May 2006, I had our son, Calder. I spent the next couple of years learning how to be a mom.","I tend not to be so attracted to films that force me into an intellectual place over an emotional one.","Boundaries get blurry and identities can get lost easily. It's easy to take your partner for granted.","I was very influenced by the films of the '70s.","I think when you're writing films that just come fresh out of your own imagination - I think probably anyone who's done that, there are certain themes or styles.","I got exposed to art-house cinema and foreign films. I was from L.A., so it was a film culture that I didn't know about.","Great actors help. Every project is different. Sometimes it's completely open, and I've been able to cast who I've wanted. And then sometimes people want a certain kind of actor.","I think for any artist, your voice is always evolving. For me, the constant is finding a tension or balance between drama and comedy.","At the base of it, my gut instinct tells me that there's a kind of fundamental misogyny in the culture. There just is. You know, there's just a weird anxiety around women.","I just think self-satisfied people ignore certain signs about other people.","Along my path, I've realized that this comedy/drama balance is something that's really interesting to me, and I feel, like, authentic to my voice."],"Lisa Edelstein":["You know what, I've always been a smarty-pants, and the only thing that goes wrong now is that people know that I play a doctor on TV and so they quickly call me out on the fact that I really think I am a doctor.","At work, we have fantastic catering people. They feed the cast and crew all day, and they're sensitive to the needs of picky vegetarians like me. They have delicious salads. I keep mine simple: romaine lettuce, avocado, baked tofu, carrots, tomatoes and Asian dressing.","I'm obsessed with broccoli, carrots, celery, string beans, snap peas, black kale, brussels sprouts, cabbage - I could go on! They used to call me 'rabbit' when I was a kid. I hate mushrooms, though. I apologize to fungi lovers, but this way, there's more for you!","I've always thrown myself into different kinds of experiences, sometimes into really bad things. But, you grow up. You become more of a woman and you know yourself. I think knowing yourself is a wonderful thing especially when you're in your 40s and you're kind of in your skin. Life is not so confusing anymore.","For me, just being how old I am, I know I don't want to be a single mom. I really would rather make it a two-person job. But I've also come to terms with not being a mother at all. I'm actually really good with either direction that my life can take as being a valid experience.","Well first of all, I think the phrase 'jump the shark' has jumped the shark. I read it in every article and I think that when Fonzie actually jumped the shark, 'Happy Days' was on the air for another five years.","I do think that people get really emotionally involved in the TV shows that they love and I think that is fantastic. Of course they are going to have opinions. The other thing is that people project onto their television shows. They see a character and layer on many traits that are actually their own or their idea of what that character is.","Exercise helps me with stress. It changes your brain chemistry. I turn to Ashtanga yoga when I feel the need to relax. I love it, but it's not right for everybody. It's taught to you a little bit at a time, according to your body type and your strength. That keeps things challenging.","Well, I don't think characters change. I think they become more revealed. I don't think you really can change a character on a show.","It's important to be gentle about my routines. I've learned that the hard way. When I'm really stressed out, I can take it out on my body and hurt myself. Sometimes I need to be as loving and soft with myself as possible. I've had to learn how to pay attention. It's a kind of mind-set.","I think writers like to see how people bring their words to life, and it's always surprising. Always, no matter what, whether it's good or bad, it's always surprising because a whole human being is coming to that piece of writing.","You know, it's scary when you sign onto a pilot of a series because, as much as you want the series to go, you also want it to be a character that you'd be interested in playing for a long time.","I just think there's always room for humanity in acting, one can only hope, so when you bring in the whole life of a person that's playing a character, then surprises happen and are allowed to happen, and so it makes it more interesting.","When I wake up, I always drink tons of Guayaki organic yerba mate tea.","No day would be complete without chocolate. My favorite: Vosges Creole bar - it's dark chocolate with cocoa nibs. Holy Toledo, that thing is good.","Aging on camera is just very hard. I love my age. I feel good about myself but high definition television is not kind. You don't even look like yourself in high-def. It just makes every little line on your face more exaggerated so it ends up aging you. It's like you're watching yourself seven years older.","I don't think that anyone can prepare for raising a child. I think it's one of those jobs that is far more overwhelming than you could ever expect and far more satisfying than you can ever expect.","You can't do things unexpected in life if you're not willing to take a risk, and it's easier to risk your own life than it is for your parent to watch you take risks. It's very, very hard for parents to see children doing things that aren't a solid path. I've been through that.","I always think, medically... you really have to be your advocate. You have to be able to back up everything that you're feeling with some information and protect yourself through the world of hospitals and doctors' offices, so the more information the better.","Everybody in the world has a different reason for wishing they could say things that most people know not to say.","I heard I won 'best butt crack' on television recently. It's true. I did it, you guys. I made it. I wish I got an award, the actual award. What would it look like? Of course, it's a closed set.","It's always weird to shoot when you're really basically not wearing anything.","Well, I don't think just because people are in a relationship that they're happy. I don't think relationships necessarily make people happy. You just are happy or you're not happy.","I never intended on moving to 'The Good Wife' permanently, but in terms of a next move and something to do to make myself feel good, this was a great opportunity.","Decades ago, women suffered through horrifying back-alley abortions. Or, they used dangerous methods when they had no other recourse. So when the Republican Party launched an all-out assault on women's health, pushing bills to limit access to vital services, we had to ask: Why is the GOP trying to send women back... to the back alley?","My opinion's no more important than anyone else's. It's just that I have the ability to have access to more ears when I speak because of my job.","By learning about my body and making small, subtle changes, I find out what I enjoy and what is effective. I'm always finessing: adjusting my diet and my workouts. You have to figure out which exercises are fun and interesting and stimulate your brain - or else you'll never keep at them.","If you eat a lot of starchy foods, introduce a vegetable once a week, then twice a week, and then three times a week. Slowly fill your diet with new flavors. By the time you're ready to let go of whatever it is you want to let go of, you've got a full menu.","The hardest part about being vegan is shoes. I mean, really, that's the only difficult part, finding shoes that don't have leather on them.","I think it's really important for celebrities to use their power of money and fame to get their voices out there. It's funny to me that we're expected to keep quiet just because of who we are. Why do I lose my right to speak my mind because I'm famous?","There are so many good roles for women out there, I don't understand it when people say the role choices are fewer as you get older. I find the opposite to be true - there are less good roles out there for the hot 20-year-olds because the normal girl parts just aren't interesting.","When you play the same character for a long time, you have a shorthand. You get onto the set, you put on your outfit and two-thirds of your work is done because you've built on that work for so many years.","There are some great shows that come and go really fast, either because the network doesn't give them a chance or they just don't grab on to the psyche of the country quickly enough.","The roles that men and women play are no longer the standard traditional roles of way back when but are those of two very individual people living their lives. I think it's been a hard transition in society - just take a look at the divorce rate - to figure out what that means now. How do you resolve that?","What does it mean to a successful woman today? Does it mean you have to be a mother? If you are a mother, does it mean you have to be a mother with a husband? If you don't have a husband, what is the role that the man plays? I think there are a lot of confusing things that we're all really still sorting out."],"Lisa Frank":["I would say there is probably a little bit of me in each character. But Purrscilla is a lot like me because she is very into glam and glitz and jewelry and everything very girly. And some of the jewelry in the illustration is even my own jewelry. But I'm not a cat fan - that's the only thing! I'm a dog person.","I'm a lunatic.","Both of my folks were into art. My dad was an art collector, my mom had a little kiln in our basement, and we would make pottery. I think from about age five on, they sent me to art classes, and I was a huge colorer.","I think I always wanted to be an artist. I sort of just followed my passion right out of high school, and everything kind of evolved for me.","If I could do anything, I think a theme park. Because the world of Lisa Frank really is a world. And I think, before I die, we should have that world someplace, not just on paper. I think that would be pretty awesome.","At first, I didn't want to do unicorns. The artist in me said no. Then I thought, 'Wait a minute: this is commercial art. Let's do what's going to sell.'","I have always wanted to do a feature film that brings the world of Lisa Frank to life. We have so much backstory on our characters, and they have been alive in my imagination since the beginning.","If I use my credit card... and they go, 'Oh my gosh, there's Lisa Frank who makes the stickers!' I go, 'Isn't that the craziest thing, that I have the same name?'","My house really is purple and yellow and hot pink and light green and orange."],"Lisa Gansky":["A brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.","Your brand is your public identity, what you're trusted for. And for your brand to endure, it has to be tested, redefined, managed, and expanded as markets evolve. Brands either learn or disappear.","The mobile Web, location-based services, inexpensive and pervasive mobile apps, and new sorts of opportunities to access cars, bikes, tools, talent, and more from our neighbors and colleagues will propel peer-to-peer access services into market.","Insurance and funding traditionally drive capital investment. But in a world based on access, not ownership, the duration, value, cost and extent of financial services is distinctly different.","For most jobs, especially those in the digital economy, there is no objective standard for being 'qualified.' If you and the team you're working with think you're qualified, you are.","The Mesh is about creating and managing what's perishable. It provides businesses with the ability to reach an audience of one, at a precise time.","I really like Kickstarter because you don't have to be a Medici to fund the arts and sciences or to get behind a big idea or a person that sparks your imagination. It's a type of microfunding directed toward creators.","I've felt a little culpable that we entrepreneurs often invent businesses just to drive people to buy more things.","At the global level, there are a growing number of city-based bike-sharing programs that take advantage of mobile devices to reserve your bike, keep track of it, and collect data that helps to improve the service.","Our ever-present mobile devices provide the immediate and convenient information necessary to make sharing things truly irresistible.","Every time we share something rather than own it ourselves, we reduce the stress on the planet. That could make the critical difference as the global population continues to grow.","We are able to use technology to make it clear that someone's car is available or a room in a home is accessible; that there is an available desk in an office someplace.","The Mesh difference is that with GPS-enabled mobile Web devices and social networks, physical goods are now easily located in space and time.","Those projects most successful on Kickstarter - those that receive funding completely and quickly - do so largely because the creator has a strong social network and invites people to be engaged.","Some of history's cleverest business minds understood the power of share platforms, from the aggressive titans who made fortunes building the nation's railroads, to Conrad Hilton, who created the first premier brand of international hotels.","A new model is starting to take root and grow, one in which consumers have more choices, more tools, more information, and more power to guide these choices. I call this emerging model 'The Mesh.'","Walmart and other big-boxers could become the center of gravity for the conservation of goods, employ people with actual know-how, and develop deeper, longer term, more profitable relationships with their customers.","A shift toward access and service would deepen the big-box retailer's relationship to customers and win their loyalty. A service focus would bring more rewarding, frequent, and lasting contact with grateful customers.","Cities are ripe for redesign, and many are already well on that path. Cloud-based networks that provide easy and inexpensive access to and tracking of services like transportation, energy, waste management, bill pay, citizen engagement and more are testing and enriching their services.","RelayRides and WhipCar, AirBnB, Roomorama and One Fine Stay are all stellar examples of how new, access-based offers entice and provoke insurance companies and banks to re-think risk, value, customers and deal terms.","When what you do and care about is aligned with what the market wants and cares about, you've created a recipe for career success.","Try out lots of different options early in your career. Then watch the responses: how you feel, what the market values, what people appreciate about you. It's the only way to find work that's uniquely right for you."],"Lisa Gardner":["I loved ghost stories, creaky staircases, stormy nights. If it guaranteed nightmares I read it by flashlight, after midnight.","I think one of the appeals of suspense is to safely explore our innermost fears.","Mental illness is a disease and organic mental illness of young kids is becoming more and more of a disease... we do need to talk about it.","I still like the relationship part of any story. You don't want your character to figure everything out and then at the end of the day, go home and eat soup from a can by herself.","I don't know much about international policing and I would love to learn more. Especially in this day and age when the Internet is rapidly reducing borders and crime can happen on a larger scale than ever before. These things intrigue me.","Before I became a suspense novelist, I wrote romantic suspense as Alicia Scott.","I'm not the most detailed writer. I have a tendency to be more action-oriented vs. descriptive.","I still read romance, and I read suspense. I read them both. And part of it is, I like stories with strong characters, and I like stories where there's closure at the end. And I like stories where there's hope. That's a kind of empowerment. I think romance novels are very empowering, and I think suspense novels are, too.","When you're on book tours, you definitely need chocolate. At all times.","I'm unique for a suspense author in that I don't have a specialty background. A lot of suspense writers used to be lawyers or crime beat reporters. I didn't even know a cop when I started out. I finally figured out that I could visit prisons - I just had to be willing to make the phone calls.","What I loved about romances was the character, and I think I still bring that to my novels. What romance taught me was that the 'who' will always matter more than the 'what.' It's fun to come up with plots, but I want to make sure the reader cares about who it's happening to.","We're all in this together - when one writer succeeds, all writers succeed. I love discovering new authors. I think we need to take care of each other and talk about craft and nurture talent.","I like to believe my suspense novels marry the strong characters from my romance writing past, with the twisty, clever plots of my mystery writing present.","I'm very intrigued by e-books, the topic du jour in the industry today. As a number one bestselling Kindle author, I love the way e-books make an author's backlist accessible to new readers. Of course, price point remains a source of concern. Personally, I don't have any of the answers, but I'm intrigued by the questions.","My secret vice is Sudoku puzzles. Can't stop playing them. My parents are accountants. I blame them entirely.","I have a huge author crush on Stephen King. Have never met him. Would probably embarrass myself. But it would be worth it.","When I got my very first phone call that I'd hit the 'New York Times' list, I had a small rush of 'I've made it!' But the next morning, it occurred to me I didn't know what it was, so I called my agent and asked what being a 'New York Times' bestselling author really meant. He informed me that I was now a thousand pound gorilla.","It is difficult to get men to pick up a female author. Women will read men, but men won't read women.","It's kind of the yin and yang that fascinate me. That for all the evil men do, there are also people who work obnoxiously long hours and sacrifice their personal lives because it is a calling - if they don't keep our streets safe, if they aren't there to advocate for and save beaten women and children and murder victims, who will?","Post-apocalyptic novels tell you that in the future there is some great war. I would tell you that most cops say that it's going on right now.","All I've really ever done is write since I was 17, so I don't know anything about anything. For me to do a novel, I have to talk to people who know things. And what keeps me in suspense is that I am a crime aficionado."],"Lisa Graff":["My love of baking might have originated with my grandmother. She had a lemon tree growing in her backyard, and one of my favorite memories is of picking lemons together and then baking lemon bars.","Being a writer can be a very lonely profession, but having a network of people who can sympathize with everything you're going through - from contract issues to the terror of changing your novel from past- to present-tense - is an invaluable asset.","One of the things I like to do during an 'overhaul' revision is bust out my highlighters and colored pens. Tools like these make me feel like a real writer.","Kids know when you're pulling a fast one, storywise, and I think that even when they're being entertained, children want to hear the truth, just like adults do.","The Longstockings are eight children's and young adult writers. We all came out of the New School MFA program, and we meet regularly to critique each other's work.","When I was in fourth grade, I had a lot of upheaval in my life. Both of my parents remarried, and we all got new houses. That was also the year my older brother got very sick.","Kids are always told that they can be anything that they want. But what if you want to be a ballerina, and you're terrible at ballet? Or what if you're gifted at ballet, but you don't like doing it?","I was the typical little sister who wanted to be just like her older brother. When I was growing up, my brother wrote phenomenal stories, so I wanted to write them, too.","I've been a children's book editor, a nanny, a camp counselor, a barista, a research lab assistant, and a movie theater ticket-taker.","I have always had a ridiculous fear that I will walk into the bathroom one morning and find a python in my toilet.","I desperately want to visit the Galapagos and meet some giant tortoises.","I'd like to have a perfect sense of direction. I could get lost with a GPS strapped to my arm."],"Lisa Guerrero":["I know I'll be under a spotlight, I know I'll be under the microscope.","When I'm anchoring, I miss chasing stories in the field.","I grew up watching Monday Night Football with Howard Cosell and the other guys with my dad.","My mom died when I was 8.","So my dad raised me, and he's a huge football fan.","When I found out I got this job, I cried, of course - I'm a girly-girl - and then I called my dad, and he cried, too. On so many levels, this is a thrill for me.","I'm comfortable with my femininity, and I don't try to change what I look like just because I'm reporting on football at the end of the night.","I'm proud of what I look like. I'm proud that I look like my mom.","I'm proud of being Hispanic.","And I'm proud of what I do as a professional, too.","Being attractive and being credible can and do go together.","You mean the fact that Tom Arnold would spend more time with the hair and makeup people than I would?","And that Michael Irvin would care more about his wardrobe than I would?","We're starting to push the envelope in terms of the expectations, and you can also have your own style, personality and sense of humor, because now we're allowed to.","I've always been the only girl in those environments. It's comfortable for me - I prefer it, actually.","I've always been around dudes and sports.","My approach is a very human one, as a fan.","I'm not going to relate to an athlete as a peer.","I want to know about what makes an athlete tick.","I'm looking forward to talking to Bill Parcells, too, and to seeing how that marriage with Jerry Jones goes.","So I plan to prepare thoroughly and have several outfits waiting in the wings in case of inclement weather.","I love color and I love to dress like a woman.","No, one of the great things about my three-year deal is that it's year-round. They've offered me an opportunity to cover a lot of things in the offseason, too.","In the morning, I reach for the sports page.","On my morning run, I listen to sports talk radio.","In terms of broadcasting, you have to make decisions about where you want to spend your time.","I was so afraid that the athletes wouldn't talk to me because I'm a woman.","You just have to hope that they'll grant you an interview.","There's that initial reticence for some athletes to take you seriously.","Constantly there's a credibility issue; you're judged on how you look. If you look good, people assume you aren't credible. It's a battle you'll always fight if you're on TV and a female."],"Lisa Hanawalt":["The way I eat in my day-to-day life is, like, very simple to the point of being absurd. Like, my boyfriend makes fun of me because if I'm eating a snack, it's often, like, a pickle and then a hard-boiled egg and then crackers and then maybe a carrot, and it's like I'm eating like a baby.","I'm not a great boss because I don't like to tell other people what to do.","When I look at my childhood art, it's the same. It's animals dressed up as people in patterned clothing. It basically looked like concept art for 'BoJack.' It's kind of uncanny.","I have existential worries inside of me, but I don't always know how to express them all the time.","I don't consider myself a political artist, but I am political just by nature of being a woman.","I used to think fashion was something unattainable and reserved only for people who look like models. But looking back, I've always made bold choices, possibly beginning with the silk jungle print jacket, orange shorts, and Nepalese cap I insisted on wearing every day when I was ten.","Fashion blogs are great, but I also take inspiration from movies, nature, everyday objects.","I think a lot of people see fashion as a feminine art form and use that as an excuse to dismiss it. Highlighting it can be a way of affirming that women's interests are of value.","We all choose what we wear every day, and I'm interested in those choices. Even if you wear the same boring hoodie sweater every day, that's a decision that tells a story about you.","I'd love to do a book with scratch n' sniff pages and pieces of string and plastic attached to the pages, you know?","I've had trouble gaining access to certain people I'd really love to interview because they're worried I'll make fun of them. I'm a pretty private and self-conscious person, so I relate to that concern!","I think the price of the food can totally alter the perception of it. If I know something is expensive and the ambience is fancy, the food just invariably tastes a little better - and I feel like I'm getting away with something. But I'm also bored by most 'fancy' food.","Good cooking is good cooking, regardless of the price.","So okay, the world through my eyes, what is that world? Well, I see a lot of dirty stuff, and I see a lot of dumb stuff.","I think, a lot of time, when I'm making art, I'm trying to get into a state of childlike play, where I'm not self-conscious; I'm not worried about what the outcome is going to be. I'm just having fun.","I've always liked writing. Even when I was in art school and thought I was going to be a gallery painter, I liked to pair my artwork with writing. And so that naturally led to drawing comics.","When I was five, six, I drew myself as a cat a lot, because I was obsessed with cats. And then, as soon as I took my first riding lesson, I started drawing horses.","I went to UCLA and studied studio art. I thought I was going to be a gallery painter, photographer, or ceramicist. Then, when I graduated, that didn't happen immediately. I didn't suddenly get solo shows in Chelsea, and I realized that is actually kind of difficult to break into.","I no longer enjoy drawing people's pets. I just want to draw what I want to draw and have people not tell me what to draw.","When people think what is the most simple sort of human, it's a white man, and anything else that is added to that complicates it for people. It comes with all kinds of meanings and connotations. If they have a different skin color, that comes with a connotation. If they're a woman, 'Oh well, what do I feel about that?'","Maybe in the world of BoJack, physical attraction is sort of different, beauty standards are different from our world because, why not? It's just more fun to have a sexy chameleon or a blue-tongued skink or whatever. I don't know how subversive that is, but it's fun for me.","I like that talented chefs are able to keep coming up with new ways of preparing food - it really is an art form.","I had to train myself to like spicy foods as I got older because they weren't a part of my upbringing at all.","The social aspects of food are really important to me - my favourite food-related memories are meals I've shared with my family and friends. Posting Instagram pictures of your food and then seeing your friends comment on it is just a modern form of that kinship.","I value multi-layered artwork that warrants a second glance, so I try my best to achieve that with my own work. If something is solely pretty or solely disgusting, you look at it once and get the gist and move on. If it's a mix of both, it's potentially more interesting.","I'm a bad artist. I'm lazy and untalented and bad.","Humans are generally much trickier to draw because we're so used to looking at and analyzing human faces. The slightest tweak makes a huge difference in how we perceive that character.","A hot dog cut up with ketchup is, like, lunch for me, so I just think it's funny to Instagram it. I just don't want to put that much effort into cooking.","I'm drawn towards people who have a little pathos and a little dark side, and I feel the same towards fictional characters.","I think being creative is incredibly difficult and painful.","It's hard to find things that haven't been said before or drawn before, but I'm trying.","I haven't thought too much about the word 'foodie,' but I definitely lie closer to the 'I just need to eat a thing to fuel myself' end of the spectrum. It's not quite a hobby. I don't feel a need to try all the newest restaurants.","I think that even at my most anxious, if I have a job to do or a role to fill, I know on some level I can step up and complete it. I mean, I'm probably not going to go bungee jumping anytime soon... but pushing myself to weather some discomfort now and then feels healthy.","My family always ate dinner at the table, and we would chat about our day while eating. My parents like to have a few glasses of wine and linger after the meal is over, peeling oranges for dessert while talking. It's lovely.","I'm not a vegetarian, but while I don't want to defend it, I try to be mindful about the amount of animal products I consume. I eat a lot of vegan meals at home, and I'm okay with paying more for higher quality meat and eggs as a tax.","I like observing intelligent people who have expertise in areas I'm mostly ignorant about.","I never thought I'd enjoy collaborating so much, but turns out it feels like a super power if you collab with the right people.","I never thought, 'I'm going to learn how to be funny now!,' and I'm still surprised when other people think I'm funny. I just learned to make jokes as a way of moving through the world. It helps me deal with all sorts of discomfort and boredom.","If someone leaves me a bad review, I briefly fantasize about pushing them down a well."],"Lisa Hannigan":["I don't know what to do with myself when it's sunny!","If I had all the money in the world, I don't think I'd want to be in the studio for longer.","It's a particular skill, I think, doing backing vocals. You're blending the vocals between the gaps, between the music.","Stephen Colbert has such a loyal following; I don't know if it's the same with Jay Leno; he really inspires love in people, and there can be a lucky ricochet of that for some people.","I've always been a singer, but I don't know if I was always a natural performer."],"Lisa Jackson":["I have always loved reading a little creep-factor and a lot of suspense.","When I made the leap from category romance to larger single-title books, I was encouraged to make the book 'big,' and suspense was allowed. Over the years, I've been able to write the kind of books I love, with a balance of suspense and romance. How lucky am I?","Characters written in 1990 would be acting like idiots if they were cast into the present. For example, the reader might wonder: Why isn't she texting? Where's her cellphone? Can't she have a simple paternity test? For God's sake, look on the Internet and check him out!","I hate that bookstores are closing. Hate it! What's better than hanging out a bookstore, be it independent or chain, and talking books with people who love books?"],"Lisa Jakub":["If you have someone in your life that you are grateful for - someone to whom you want to write another heartfelt, slanted, misspelled thank you note - do it. Tell them they made you feel loved and supported. That they made you feel like you belonged somewhere and that you were not a freak. Tell them all of that. Tell them today.","After an 18-year career, I left the film industry, not wanting to become one of those child-actor cautionary tales.","My memoir is about my time in film and the decision to leave Hollywood, grow up, and stop pretending.","So many people pass up older dogs, which is a shame. With an older dog, you know what you are getting.","You never know how much time you have with someone.","What was really wonderful about the 'Doubtfire' shoot is that we had this really long rehearsal period in the beginning. That was a great time to get to know each other. We got to know each other and to create the family vibe. So we really didn't have to force it.","Hello, my name is Lisa Jakub. But most people in a restaurant/dentist's office/yoga studio dressing room, call me 'Hey, you look like that girl from 'Mrs. Doubtfire'/'Independence Day'/'Rambling Rose.' There is a good reason for that. I am that girl. More accurately, I was that girl.","My memoir is being published by Beaufort Books and will be available fall of 2015. It's about my unusual life as a child actor and how I made the unpopular choice to leave Hollywood, grow up, and stop pretending.","When I was 14 years old, I went on location to film 'Mrs. Doubtfire' for five months, and my high school was not happy. My job meant an increased workload for teachers, and they were not equipped to handle a 'non-traditional' student. So, during filming, they kicked me out.","It's estimated that 16 million people in the U.S. have struggled with depression - and I include myself in that statistic. It's real, and it's not shameful, and there is help available. You can bring it to the light, you can tell the truth, you can go to a meeting, you can reach out to a friend. None of us are alone."],"Lisa Kleypas":["Love is always a leap into the unknown. You can try to control as many variables, and understand a situation as you can, but you're still jumping off a cliff and hoping that someone catches you.","We all know that being able to express deep emotion can literally save a person's life, and suppressing emotion can kill you both spiritually and physically.","The way glass can be molded or blown or cut into any kind of shape made me think about how we as people - our characters or souls - can be shaped or changed by outside influences.","I have always been an obsessive reader - I remember going back and forth to the local library with stacks of books taller than I was.","I always counsel aspiring novelists that passion is the most important quality for a writer to possess - technique can be taught, but that relentless desire to write has to come from within.","Before I write the first page of a novel, I spend a long time creating detailed backgrounds for my characters. I imagine the experiences that have formed them, what makes them happy, angry, fearful, and what they yearn for.","It's difficult for most of us to be completely honest with ourselves - we hate to admit how vulnerable or needful we are.","I grew up being very shy, very much a bookworm, and I remember desperately wondering how to be accepted by the popular kids.","I will admit, I once launched myself at Julie Garwood for a hug, hoping some of her magic would rub off on me... and I have fangirl crushes on Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Linda Howard, and Kresley Cole, among many others.","My ultimate crush may be Judith McNaught - I met her once more than 20 years ago, and she was incredibly kind and encouraging to me. I adore that woman. But I also fangirl over aspiring or beginning authors, because every time I talk with them, I'm so energized and inspired.","I'd gone to Wellesley College, an amazing women's college where the students were encouraged to follow our dreams. However, after I graduated and had a historical romance published, more than a few people indicated that, in some way, my career choice was a 'waste' of so much education.","No matter what your profession is, it's good to scare yourself a little from time to time! It's crucial to keep challenging yourself and to learn from people who are more accomplished than you are.","When something terrible happens, how you react determines who you are from then on.","This is not Tolstoy. I don't want to know what critics and professors think of what I'm writing. It might hurt my feelings."],"Lisa Kristine":["Around the world, human traffickers trick many people into slavery by false promises of good jobs or good education, only to find themselves forced to work without pay, under the threat of violence.","My work is about the establishment of trust. For someone to share their authenticity with me is a soul-to-soul thing. It's not a lens-to-soul thing.","Slavery is illegal everywhere, but it exists all over the world.","When people think of slavery, they think of an era from the distant past. Grainy photographs from Civil War times. And yet it goes on.","The stones in your driveway may have come from the slaves who spend all day breaking rocks because it's cheaper for the company to get them from India, where the labor is free. We are all connected. And we all have human value. That's what my work is about.","My son, who is five, was adopted from Ethiopia. My daughter was adopted from Guatemala. Her parents died of typhoid and malaria. We got her from an orphanage. They are the lights of my life.","I see myself as a witness to humanity.","In 2009, at the Vancouver Peace Summit, I met a supporter of Free the Slaves, an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern-day slavery; weeks later, I flew down to Los Angeles and met with the director of Free the Slaves; thus began my journey into exploring modern-day slavery.","Oddly, I'd been to most of the locations where I started photographing slavery many times before. I even considered some of them homes-away-from-home. But there can be dark corners in familiar places.","One advantage of photography is that it's visual and can transcend language."],"Lisa Kudrow":["Blonde is dumb comedy, red hair is smart, sexy comedy.","Since I had the baby I can't tolerate anything violent or sad, I saw the Matrix and I had my eyes closed through a lot of it, though I didn't need to. I would peek, and then think, oh OK, I can see that.","I've learned you can make a mistake and the whole world doesn't end. I had to learn to allow myself to make a mistake without becoming defensive and unforgiving.","You become a celebrity, not because of your work or what you do, but because you have no privacy.","I found the right man, got married, and just had to keep not reinventing myself, just deciding that it doesn't matter what you are if you are a good person.","I'm the youngest in my family, and everyone is very funny, and I was always trying to keep up with them. I just loved making people laugh.","I have no affectation when I speak.","Shirley MacLaine said, You're so funny, then gave me a hug. Everything went white. I couldn't hear, I couldn't see. I thought I was going to pass out.","I'm pretty middle-of-the-road. There are some issues I'm more conservative on.","An actress, around 40, on television, that's where you get the most torture, I think.","Christina Ricci is amazing, the most professional actor I think I've ever met. You can be chatting with her and when they call action, she's right there.","I'd played dumbasses a lot. On Mad About You, I played a very dumb waitress and they saw me.","I actually made an effort to reject acting, to shove it out of my body, because I didn't want my kids to have an actress as a mother-to have, like, a silly person.","I do like reality shows, and I watch some of them because they're high drama. It's also just fun to watch people have honest reactions.","I knew an actor's career goes up and down and back up again. Your standing in this business can't be your whole identity; otherwise, you're doomed.","I wanted to be the kind of woman who would attract a certain kind of man that I could respect. That was my thinking. It had to do with the kind of couple I would be a part of.","I'll accept being Phoebe to people for a while longer, given how much fun it was. That's totally fair.","I've been careful to keep my life separate because it's important to me to have privacy and for my life not to be a marketing device for a movie or a TV show. I'm worth more than that.","My hair got lighter, and I gradually went blonde. I liked it. Had more fun. But my image of myself in my head is this dark-haired person.","On network TV, I'm still Phoebe to people, and it would be hard to convince them otherwise in the bright lights of a sitcom.","One fantasy is that I just do a Don Roos movie every year if that's possible. If he'd have me.","Watching a person lose their dignity used to be uncomfortable, and now it's an expected part of the program that we're becoming comfortable with.","We treat sex so casually and use it for everything but what it is-which is ultimately making another human being with thoughts and feelings and rights.","We wanted to do a woman on a reality show because that's what's happening right now-it's part of our culture."],"Lisa Lampanelli":["People with HIV and AIDS are nothing to be afraid of. They are people just like every single one of us, and each has a story to tell. These people should be helped, embraced, and not dismissed. We need to open our hearts and our minds to them, and we just may learn we're pretty much all the same.","I keep getting asked out by really young, good looking boys and really ugly lesbians. So, even if I wanted to jump onto the tuna boat, I wouldn't because I'm not getting high-class babes that I should get at this level of my career. And I always know the ugly ones are serious and that the good-looking ones are goofing on me.","When I say I'm going gangster, I'm working really hard at something.","Comedy is like music - there are genres and styles for every taste. Katy Perry is there for people who like frothy pop music. Metallica is there for people who like head-banging metal. And Susan Boyle is there for... well, I don't who the hell is listening to that freak of nature, but that's not the point. In art, there's something for everybody.","I don't like any of it. I'm sick and tired of menopause.","When doing comedy, I do what makes me laugh. The first person I learned from said I should talk about things I am passionate about - that I love or hate - because the audience likes to see passion. The stuff I rant and rave about stems from a place that really pisses me off.","Betty White is so old that on her first game show ever, the prize was fire.","In the end, censoring a comedian's jokes is on par with censoring 'Huckleberry Finn.' Now, I'm not comparing myself to Mark Twain - he had much wavier hair and a slightly thicker mustache. But when you deny an artist the chance to explore his art, you're forcing your beliefs on him.","I always order soup, dessert, and a sandwich or whatever main course. But then the idea is you have to eat such a small portion of it and bring the rest home.","With Don Rickles and me, we're just telling the truth. We're not terrific people, and we're not gonna win the beauty contest. We're just average Joes. We're just being who we are, and I think people like that.","Insult comedy has been around forever. I can make fun of people, and they won't get mad at me.","What you bring to the stage is what you are in real life... people sense that.","I usually get so warned when I go to Detroit, like, 'Oh my God, don't go to this section, don't go to that section.' I've never had any issues in Detroit. I love that there's enough of a racial mix of people to make fun of. I've always had a good time there.","'Baywatch' sucks so bad. I didn't watch it the first time around; I'm sure not going to buy a DVD. But really, you just kind of find out the categories of what's most foolish about these people. With Hasselhoff, it's obviously the huge man-tits with chest hair, probably a lot about his crappy acting, obviously the hamburger video - that's huge.","I've never wanted to be a person where somebody would be like, 'I like her; she's okay.' Love or hate is fine, because it sells tickets.","Interesting-looking people have always been comedians, and it's rare that someone who has the choice to model ends up being a comic. Except for maybe Whitney Cummings, but that's about it. That's why she's special: because she can combine it.","I don't sell myself. I've never explained my comedy to people who don't get it. Never complain. Never explain.","I feel that if I retire today, I've done enough. I've achieved everything in comedy... I feel I don't need anything else. It's already built.","My thing has always been, I've never been very open and vulnerable with people, so the minute I got this dog, everything changed. It just opened me up and made me more loving... It's all because of him... He's made me a better person... I can tell people what I feel now. I can cry in front of people sometimes.","Mr. Trump, I really can't comment, because he was my boss on 'Celebrity Apprentice,' and I just don't think we should let him be president until he produces evidence that the thing on his head is real. Because he wanted to see Obama's birth certificate, we should ask for a certificate of real hair.","The dog lasted. The marriage didn't. So it shows which relationship was meant to be.","I wasn't ready to be a dog's mother! Trust me, I'm completely unfit and irresponsible. I'm a comic that travels 48 weeks a year, but I make it work, so you can, too.","I was 25 myself once. I also thought I knew everything. I also thought that I could give singers singing advice and comics comedy advice. When you're that age, you know it all, so I understand it. But when you're tired and you don't have patience for it, you definitely snap.","I say every slur on the planet - racial, homosexual, everything to do with every ethnic group on the planet - and guess what? I will never apologize for that because I know why I do it, and it is to make a valid point about ignorance in this society.","We usually let our husbands negotiate the house and the cars. But I never had a husband, so I was always buying my own houses and cars, so I knew how to negotiate.","If they hate you, they hate you, but I've always been polarizing, and I love that.","When I decided to do 'The Celebrity Apprentice,' there was absolutely no question that I would play the game for GMHC.","Shortly after college, I was working in New York City at 'Rolling Stone' magazine.","Too many people have already lost their lives to HIV and AIDS, and the more celebrities who can bring attention to the issue, the better.","I've played every comedy club and every theatre across the country for the last 25 years and seen a lot of audience members from different ethnic persuasions.","I lasted seven years as a journalist, and I've been doing comedy for twenty years.","I kind of knew inside that I wanted to try comedy, but it was a mystery. How do you start? So when I hit 30 and I had done everything I wanted to do in journalism, so I went to a comedy class. I figured I'd learn how to do five minutes and see how it feels.","I always wrote about myself in the third person. I knew how to promote myself so it sounded intelligent. I know how to package myself.","I do a big roast of Trump during my set now - which I clearly expanded on - because there's so much to make fun of him about now.","I'm not a political comic at all, so it would be weird if I just turned into a preachy, sort-of political commentator.","I'm always proud of what I've done and what I continue to do.","If Flavor Flav was any smaller and darker, Brad and Angelina would try to adopt him.","Ticket sales will get higher the day after roasts.","I'm not a private person. I like hanging out and talking to fans. But my life isn't so interesting that you want to see the inside of it.","I remember, after the Pamela Anderson roast, being told, 'You're sold out - you can add two more shows.'","I've gone through literally over 30 years of struggle with weight and food and body image... and I'm like, 'Wait a minute.'","This thing happened where I noticed anytime I got together with four friends or more, the conversation goes to food.","I got sick of trying everything. I tried every single thing imaginable - diet, exercise. I even bought a house on the health spa property, and I still gained weight.","I order food like a normal human being. If I'm out to lunch, I'm going to order three courses like everybody else. I'm not going to feel like some kind of freak.","When you're dealing with a sick person, you're not important at all. You're just a nobody.","I'm not looking for 'outer esteem' anymore, what they call 'other esteem.' I'm looking for self-esteem. And people think that self-esteem is built with accomplishments. And, 'Hey, look what I did in my life.'","I thought I had to work at someplace everybody's heard of. It was never, 'I'm interested in such and such. I want to work in such and such magazine.' It was like, 'Oh, my G-d, I really need to work for somebody so people will think I'm OK.' So I got a job at 'Popular Mechanics'.","I looked around and couldn't believe no one has written a show about women and eating. It's the biggest issue women have.","I heard Cher say, 'I answer to two people: Myself and God.' I say, 'I only answer to me. I'm not sure I appreciate God's opinion.'","None of my comedy depended on looks. I never did tons of fat jokes.","I lost over 100 pounds, so I'm even angrier than ever. I don't stuff my feelings anymore with food. Skinny girls are funny.","By Hollywood standards I'm still fat: until you are zero, you are big. I do get cold a lot now. I used to have a lot of layers - now I got to get a fur coat.","I would make a few jabs at myself and go for the audience - they are still as flawed as ever.","I have rage and anger issues. So I get mad about stuff in real life, and then I yell about it onstage, and luckily, something funny ends up coming out. What I'll do is tape-record it, and it will end up coming out even funnier. And I add more punch lines.","I hate comics who look at comedy as therapy. But at least it gets things out of my system in a funny way.","I have a shrink in New York and a shrink in Arizona, just in case. You never know when you will have a breakdown.","The thing is, in the dating profiles it says 'spiritual,' but not with a specific religion. And so I pretty much try to meditate, but I have a very hard time concentrating on things other than me.","I've really been working on the emotional and internal issues that made me eat in the first place. It's been a real journey.","I honestly feel like 99 percent of people have some kind of self-hate about their looks, and if I can joke about mine, maybe they can feel better about theirs.","I'm way too famous and rich to be on a dating app, but if I get very desperate by the time I'm 60, I'll go on Tinder. Or I'll go on 'Millionaire Matchmaker'; I'll call Patti Stanger.","Nobody escapes during Lisa Lampanelli's show.","That's the whole thing: You only roast the ones you love. That's why I never make fun of the French.","I think people were just seriously happy to find a funny woman who does comedy like a man. Because I learned how to do comedy from guys, from watching those Dean Martin roasts years ago.","I really think the biggest honor, as a comic, is to get roasted by either the Friars Club or the Comedy Central or someone like that. Because it really shows, you know, that you've arrived.","The more conservative you dress, the more you can get away with.","I just really work hard on myself every day.","What we do as comics can be a service to people. It can make them laugh and take their mind off their problems for a few minutes.","I can really serve the audience instead of making this about me and about serving myself and my pocketbook.","Donald is very happy with his lovely wife, insert name here.","Don't laugh at a hair joke, Trump.","William Shatner is living proof that if you are talented and nice, you can work in this industry forever.","Andy Dick is so gay, he thinks Margaret Cho is funny.","I'm a take-no-prisoners type of comic, and I'm lucky because my fans get me and never have a problem with the politically incorrect themes of my act. But I am continually amazed by how a certain section of our society seems to be so freakin' sensitive about jokes.","By being politically correct, you're closing your mind to a different point of view. Which sounds a lot like prejudice. Which is definitely not politically correct. See what I just did there?","Make a list of the people in your 'choir'... If you're not on your own list, then you're doing something wrong.","You have to really be on your own side.","I didn't feel ready to leave home, because it went from no freedom to all freedom. And I was like, 'Oh, my God, I don't know what I'm doing in college.' There seemed to be no like-minded people where I was... I didn't have a clan. I didn't have a choir... There was no safety net.","Until I got the weight off, there was something inside of me that said, 'You hate yourself.' You get too depressed over the weight to really work on this. For whatever reason, I had to take the weight off to do this work.","Basically, I think some of the weight helped take some of the walls down in reality, so basically I got a little more confident. I'm definitely not super confident, but I am confident that I don't have to hide behind those layers of fat and that I can actually open up to people a little more.","It used to be that in media, Johnny Carson used to be the most important person when he would invite you over to sit on the couch after your comedy skit. Now it's whatever Howard Stern says goes.","I remember once doing a benefit for a Jewish charity and wearing an enormous cross. I kind of don't let the audience dictate anything to me. I sort of dictate to them, and they better be on board.","I'm not ready to die yet. I have, like, 40 years left that I have to make up for all of the trouble I caused in my first 50 years.","A roast is really an honor. If they picked me to be roasted, I'd be the most flattered I'd be in my life. If I could pick some people to roast, I'd pick my heroes, Don Rickles and Howard Stern. Those are the people I'd like to give some honor to.","The only reason I was allowed to have a career for a quarter century as an insult comic is because it's all in jest and all for fun.","Every day, I wake up and ask, 'Am I hungry?' If I'm physically hungry, I eat something that's hopefully good for me, and then do it again in a few hours. If I get a phone call I don't like, I'll say to myself, 'Is that the reason I want to eat something?' If it is, I try not to do it. It's literally a lifestyle.","I gained weight, and that started a 32-year struggle with weight and exercise and body image problems.","I'm not saying the N word anymore.","I'm not gonna ruin my reputation with the blacks no more.","Howard Stern gave me the best advice about Twitter and the N word. He said maybe onstage people get the intention behind the joke, but a tweet is 140 characters or less, and maybe that's why people overreact. I don't need to rustle any more feathers and lose any investors.","I know Bea Arthur left the Pam Anderson roast really early, but it could have been because she was half dead; I don't know.","Before, I didn't do celebrity stuff, 'cause Kathy Griffin did that, but now, if you're going to make jokes on Twitter, you have to stay current.","I'm obsessed with reality TV anyway - I use my knowledge of that stuff to make jokes on Twitter and Facebook to get more people to sign up to be fans.","Crazy diets, good diets, you can't name one I didn't do."],"Lisa Leslie":["I'm a better and more educated person because of basketball.","Goal-setting and achieving those goals - that's just what I do.","For me, being tall was very positive because I thought my mom was the most beautiful person ever.","Well, the first quality of being a good leader is you have to be able to follow. See, a good leader can't just be the leader all the time, I have to be able to follow.","Everyone talks about age, but it's not about age. It's about work ethic. Winning never gets old.","I'm strong, I'm tough, I still wear my eyeliner.","I don't think I would have been able to stick with it and been proud of who I am and be feminine out on the court. I think I would have folded to the peer pressure if I didn't have my mom to encourage me to be me and be proud of how tall I am.","I'm probably taller than 90% of the men I meet.","I think it's great for the women to show that they are women and be feminine. And that's something that I've always promoted.","You just don't want to get pigeon-holed into one position. That's why even though I start out at center, I may play small forward, if I get a rebound and you're not there I can bring the ball up.","I have 'the first' attached to my name in a whole lot of different aspects when it comes to the sport of basketball.","Actually just recently I came up with that idea, watching the movie 'Legally Blonde' and I was like, 'Cool, that's something I want to do.'","Until now, until I actually got into law class, I just never thought of it as being an interest for me, but it's really funny because now that I'm in law, I'm like 'Wow, I could be a lawyer.","It's really not about the money. It's just about educating yourself.","There's a lot of women in the WNBA. There's a lot of women who could be here. To be voted by the fans says a lot - that people are aware of what's going on. I'm really thankful. I think they just really appreciate my talent so I'm definitely grateful.","I've grown so much since 1996. I think that was the turning point of when I started to go to church every Sunday and not just because you're supposed to. But because you enjoy going and listening to the Word and being excited about it.","To feel the presence of the Lord is an amazing thing.","Boys have a tendency to jump around a lot more than girls. Boys have that desire to want to dunk way more than girls do. It just never seemed like something we could truly fathom and do.","Right now I'm 185, which is really good for me yet very hard for me to maintain. My weight seems high for the average woman, but I've got big bones and I'm maintaining muscle.","Most people compliment me on maintaining my femininity while I'm on the court. People like the fact that I model. My fans or little girls always say they want to play sports, but also want to be a model like me and I think that's great.","When I watch kids play basketball, they don't know how to think the game. They know what it should look like, but they don't know why.","I always knew I wanted to be in television when I was a kid, and I knew I wanted to model."],"Lisa Ling":["There's so much grey to every story - nothing is so black and white.","The best education I have ever received was through travel.","We live in a culture where we're bombarded with so much noise and so much insecurity.","Our time on Earth is so random.","Parents are working more than ever before and unable to monitor what kids are eating at home, and schools are selling astronomical amounts of junk food in order to supplement shrinking budgets. It's a ticking time bomb, and America's children are exploding.","Coming from an Asian culture, I was always taught to respect my elders, to be a better listener than a talker.","Try to accomplish things you have always dreamt of while you can. I know it sounds cliche, but the biggest lesson I have learned is that life is precious; enjoy it while it lasts.","It is said that the way to prevent obesity is not to allow kids to become overweight in the first place. But it takes a multi-pronged approach that has to start with parents. Kids are just too young to understand the consequences of obesity.","I had a planned C-section, and I cried the entire day before I had the baby.","I don't know that I'm going to entirely do cloth diapers. I'd like to be ambitious about it, but in all honesty, I can't say that I will.","I think that's something people need to convey because you see all these celebrity moms out there, and the perception is they can do it all, but they have sooo much help. And it's kind of an unfair image to project for many women, because it is really hard, and if you have help, you should indicate you have help.","People are starting to know more about it, but I was blown away by Almaty, Kazakhstan. It's like a future Swiss Alps. It has the potential to be an extraordinary ski resort. It is a city with beautiful mountain scapes.","I'm determined to raise a strong girl.","We are such a product of our upbringing and environment.","When you take the time to understand why your parents did the things they did, you stand a good chance of learning more about your own behavior.","My hope is that I can somehow raise the level of consciousness about world events.","I hadn't wanted to have a kid until I met my partner.","At the end of the day, TV is supposed to be entertaining. But it's important for me that there's some take-away value from it.","I have not watched 'Honey Boo Boo'.","I honestly never had the biological need to reproduce until I met my husband. But by the same token, even if we were unsuccessful, we were totally okay with adopting.","I am a crazy online shopper. My husband always jokes, 'Another box arrived!' Airplanes used to be my sanctuary for reading books, but now I have to peruse Gilt sales.","I'm a big Ping-Pong addict. I love it.","One of the most important things I'm glad we did and am proud of is that we don't have any real grass on our property. It might not be realistic to ask people to pull out their grass, but we'll never have to think about it. We used Smart Grass, and I think it looks beautiful.","Make your relationship your number-one priority.","My husband and I try to spend some time every night that I'm home talking without distractions.","You should treat your marriage like a business that you wouldn't want to let fail. I'm a big advocate of therapy and third-party intervention.","I had my issues with the Kardashians, absolutely. I think there's so much wrong with how they are the most revered family in the country, but they are, nevertheless.","The city of Oia is the most magnificently romantic place I've ever been.","I don't remember my first trip, but I do remember when my mom took me to Disney World in Orlando. It wasn't the rides but Epcot Center that most fascinated me. It made me want to see those countries that are represented there for real.","I don't cook anything.","We're doing a partial green nursery and trying as hard as we can to do as much organic stuff for our nursery as we can.","I started running when I was 21 years old and studying in China.","I used to be so twig skinny that I couldn't eat enough, because I was just naturally skinny. Until I went to China.","I never run hills. My quads are already big enough. I don't run to build muscle; I do it for cardio.","I have a zillion bottles of hot sauce. I love Trader Joe's jalapeno. The whole right side of my fridge is filled with hot sauce.","I like crunchy things like Baked Lays.","I hope my desire to travel so much isn't forever because it's not the most conducive lifestyle for a relationship or a family by any means.","I fancy myself as being a fairly competent person.","There are so many kids in this world, and in this country, that need homes. And so we're perfectly content to look into adoption one day, if for some reason we aren't able to have a biological child.","There are so many factors to lead to a child becoming obese.","Very often, overweight children have parents who are struggling with weight issues.","I started working in television quite young, actually, and I definitely felt very insecure about what I looked like.","My first job in TV was hosting this young teen magazine show, and all these high school teenagers showed up from all over Sacramento, California, and they chose four of us to host the show, two boys and two girls. And of the two girls, I was kind of the perky smart one and the other girl was the pretty one.","Personally, I've always known that I wanted to go back to work because I'm confident, and I'm certain that my daughter will have a better mother in me if I'm doing the things that I'm excited about and that I'm passionate about."],"Lisa Loeb":["When someone asks if you'd like cake or pie, why not say you want cake and pie?","With my daughter, we do arts and crafts, we read a lot, we listen to music, and we cut the strings off balloons and bounce them around after birthday parties.","I think a good mom is an awake mom. At least for me, I've always been a kinder, better person awake than sleep-deprived!","One of the things that's influenced me musically was my experience at Brown University. I was surrounded by musicians that I really admired, and felt challenged to come up with music, lyrics, and recordings that stood up to the expectations of those musicians and myself.","I have three siblings. My sister makes music. My older brother is a classical conductor, and my younger brother is a mixing engineer.","The shows are so different from each other, depending on whether I play with my band, Nine Stories, other musicians, an orchestra, only one or two members of my band.","Also, I'm always learning better and better how to prioritize and how to leave certain things for the next day.","I don't think I can tell any stories about how I lived in a van in Alaska. I grew up in the suburbs, I even had my own room. We weren't poor. Everything was very normal.","Where I grew up in Dallas, things might be a little more traditional. People have the same things in mind. They're supposed to grow up, go to college, get a job, get married, and have children, grandchildren. That's the world I grew up in.","The guys in my band are great-we watch movies, we eat pizza, take walks, read books. Everybody has a really great sense of humor. And my boyfriend comes and visits me on the road.","I use my cell phone as much as I can - I talk to friends all the time. I'm like 2,000 hours a month. It's crazy.","I want to work on some more complicated baking... and it would be interactive!","I'm making a record that's half stripped down acoustic which is the way I perform a lot and half of it is very produced. It's really hard to keep music simple but I was trying to keep it simple and focus on one or two instruments and vocals.","Dweezil and I are going on tour with the band probably starting in the middle of February for a month probably playing a few songs from my new record and then I'll continue on after that tour.","I have many memories of waking up to eat breakfast that my mother carefully prepared for us and her saying, what do y'all want for lunch, and as we're eating lunch, what do y'all want for dinner? It's always about the next meal.","My nutritionist always said to eat whatever you want.","You should try to get what you want in life and try not to be limited.","A friend of mine once told me that I can't screw up when I play my own music. I also take voice lessons, play other peoples' songs out of music books, and occasionally figure out how to play other people's music from records. This keeps my ears, fingers, and mind working.","My overnight success was really 15 years in the making. I'd been writing songs since I was 6 and playing in bands and performing since I was 14.","I don't use simple words. I make games and puzzles with my songs.","Some people train for certain sports and I want to train to be able to hold a super heavy electric guitar and carry luggage around myself because I always have to have 7,000 pairs of shoes. Who cares about sports?","I eat fish and love bacon. Plus, I don't mind if soups are made with chicken or beef stock, I just don't like eating big pieces of meat.","There's a variety and depth to the song topics I get to write about in children's music and books: being able to write about things I wouldn't normally write about, like a disappointing pancake, or monsters or opposite day is really different than writing about heartbreak and relationships.","The Lisa Loeb Eyewear line was created to satisfy all of those people who always stop me and ask me where I get my glasses because they want some just like mine!","I always find myself stopping to write down ideas of things I'd like to make from computer hardware items to things new moms need - inventions to share with others to make their lives more fun or interesting or easy.","Again, I'm used to speaking to a lot of people; I have a lot of friends and family, and I perform music and speak in front of a lot of crowds. So I share with people already a lot in my life.","Yeah, well, food is always a part of everything.","The only way to get vegetables at a diner late night is to order the omelette. A feta cheese and broccoli omelette.","Again, I don't hold it against somebody if they don't know who I am - I don't know who a lot of people are.","I always wanted to make a children's album because you have the freedom to explore so many wonderful topics and sounds.","I want children to be glued to interactive books that encourage singing and dancing. I feel when kids work together it brings about a different energy.","When I grew up we had gym at school, two or three dance classes after school, ice skating lessons, and all sorts of sports at our finger tips. We weren't glued to computers because they didn't exist, so being active was all we knew.","I didn't realize what an impact having a No. 1 single would have. It connects me with people of different ages, and I get to travel all over the world.","I think we were raised in a nice Texas Jewish family where education was the most important thing, and close behind that was the arts. It was emphasized and expected that we'd play piano.","Although my dad was a doctor, we weren't necessarily a super-artsy family. We were just a classic, traditional family who got to take a lot of piano lessons and became a bunch of musicians.","I've made music for grownups most of my life as a singer/songwriter - often with my band, Nine Stories - recorded many albums, and 10 years ago I started recording kid's music, too.","I'm old-school. I want to be there to drop off my daughter at school and pick her up.","It's really hard to balance work and being a mother.","As a musician, you never understand why people connect with certain songs.","I love when people in culture show up on fictional TV shows. I don't mind at all being a name from the '90s.","When I was a kid, for me, the '60s seemed so far away. But I was actually born in the late '60s.","I think people are always nostalgic for a time about 20 years before they were born."],"Lisa Lutz":["Hair color is the easiest way to change your appearance, but a bad dye job might draw more attention to you.","I have a love/hate relationship with jogging.","My writing process is chaos. I usually start with an overarching theme. Then I establish several story threads, but I don't outline. I just start writing and keep notes for what may come. It's an organic process that's usually pretty flexible.","I didn't feel a strong bond with the parents who raised me, and I had anything but a happy childhood. My mother was overly sensitive; my father, ascetic. I was neither. I felt as if I were living with complete strangers. I suspect that my parents felt the same way.","'Await Your Reply' by Dan Chaon. I've always been obsessed with the idea of disappearing and becoming someone else. Even if you don't share that obsession, I can't recommend this book highly enough.","'The Chosen,' if you recall, was based on the Chaim Potok novel and featured Robbie Benson's persuasive performance as a Hasidic Jew.","Sometimes a single item can wrap up, in a nutshell, who a person is. In my grandparents' home, a clear plastic container was enthroned on top of the mahogany bar for at least a decade. Painted on the lid in pink, yellow and light blue was 'Have a Nosh With Mort & Ethel'.","I wouldn't say that my family is normal.","I could never really choose a favorite book, but whenever I'm asked what my favorite movie is, I always say 'Withnail & I,' a British film from 1987. It's funny and sad and absolutely gorgeous to look at. It's the film I can watch over and over again.","I was on a few surveillance jobs as part of a big team. I would be the person to follow the subject on foot when the need arose. But most of the time, we were sitting in a car doing nothing.","I am a huge Mel Brooks fan. And I do think that not seeing his canon of classics is a bit criminal or clueless.","I was young, maybe 4, when I learned where babies came from.","When I was 6, I learned where I came from, which was one step removed from the usual circumstances. I was adopted.","The sense of not knowing where I came from let me be as smart as I wanted to be.","Humor is the only way to tell a story. Especially the dark ones.","I usually have a sense of where my characters are personally and ways in which they might transform throughout the novel. But I never know at the outset how the book will end, nor do I ever stick to my original plan.","People transform in some ways, and they remain exactly the same in others. Often, the thing you'd like to change the most about yourself is where you will forever remain stuck.","I've got no business giving advice to anyone. Even a fictional character.","While I had no intention of ending the series after 'The Spellmans Strike Again,' I did close many doors in that book and, with the fifth one, I was opening a lot of doors and not finding anything behind them and then opening another door and another until I found something. It was a while before I found my stride.","I loved writing the Spellman novels, but I never had any plan to only write in one genre.","I tend to start books with a very broad outline, but I always leave room for happy accidents. With 'The Passenger,' there were perhaps too many of those.","I don't feel like I'm a writer who works under any influence.","There's no reason why a writer shouldn't explore and use different genres.","I worked for a private investigative agency briefly. I rarely had the opportunity to snoop.","I have certain rules for snooping, under which anything out in the open is fair game.","You can't be suspicious 24/7. It's too exhausting.","I'm not a huge fan of research, but sometimes you get an idea, and then you realize you don't know anything.","If you're trying to hide, avoid using your own name. Have a couple spares that you can pull out of your pocket anytime, the more thoroughly documented the better.","I'm always accused of being a crime novelist, but I'm not really.","I love 'The Wire'. I can't think of a television show that I think is superior to it in any way. I was obsessed with it from the moment it came on the air. I do also love 'Doctor Who' and 'Get Smart'.","I liked the idea of exposing the beams in collaborative novel. And there are many - especially in the crime world - there are many people working together: James Patterson and his stable of sub authors; and then there are like Ken Bruen and Reed Farrel Coleman and Jason Starr.","I was never obsessed with being adopted. I was simply curious about my biological parents.","I learned how to cross-country ski.","I have certain rules for snooping, under which anything out in the open is fair game. But I also think, in light of some current trends in our culture, that privacy should be respected.","I investigate more directly. I tend to ask a lot of questions and don't feel satisfied until I have the answer.","Years ago, when my attempts at a writing career came to a complete stand-still, I applied to the Los Angeles Police Department. This might seem odd for a liberal woman who once went to UC Santa Cruz, but I've always had a powerful fascination with crime and serious interest in finding different ways to contend with it.","If I were one of the three viable presidential candidates, I doubt I'd be too broken up about someone looking into my passport file. Go ahead look, I'd say. It's the passport photo I wouldn't want anyone getting his hands on.","My mother, at sixty, is one of those classic beauties: all neck and cheekbones, sharp lines that hide her wrinkles from a distance. She still gets whistles from construction workers from three stories up.","For more than three months, I had been president and primary owner of Spellman Investigations, and I can say with complete certainty that I had more power in this office as an underling. My title, it seemed, was purely decorative. I was captain of an unfashionable and sinking ship.","Maggie is my sister-in-law, married to my brother David. She is a defense attorney who devotes 25 percent of her practice to pro bono wrongful-incarceration cases.","I'd like to think that if I were in prison for a crime I didn't commit, someone would be trying to get me the hell out of there.","Although I'm not an orphan and I can't lift a horse. I was, however, briefly famous for my feats of strength: at about age 11, I could competitively arm-wrestle a full-grown man.","Band I listen to most: The Ramones.","I've always adored the filmmaker Sam Fuller. The first time I watched 'Shock Corridor' was such a magnificent discovery. I love his lack of subtlety, the way he tackles serious topics with bold and inappropriate humor.","To properly investigate a subject, we must investigate a subject's stuff.","We're all amateur investigators. We scan bookshelves, we ogle trinkets left out in the open, we calculate the cost of furniture and study the photographs on display; sometimes we even check out the medicine cabinet.","I wrote the first draft of 'Plan B' the summer after I turned 21.","Finally, I'm recognizing that rewrites aren't some cosmic punishment for childhood wrongs but the nature of the business.","I wrote my first screenplay on a lark, because it was a storytelling format that felt like a familiar shorthand - we all watch movies, don't we? But even though I grew up in Los Angeles, my family was entirely unconnected with the movie industry, and I never truly believed that it would one day be my fate.","Six years after I wrote the first draft of 'Plan B,' I received my first paycheck as a writer. It included both the $3,000 in deferred option money as well as half the fee for performing the initial rewrite. The amount was scale according to the Writer's Guild guidelines, but a lot, according to me."],"Lisa Madigan":["It is never too late to correct our mistakes. And if we do not, we risk repeating them.","Stalking is a crime that can paralyze an otherwise productive person with fear.","A ban on same-sex marriage violates the state Constitution's equal protection clause.","Stalking is a serious crime with serious consequences.","In every community in Illinois, same-sex couples have chosen to join together and, in many instances, to raise families of their own. These couples are our relatives and friends, our neighbors, co-workers and parents of our children's classmates. They deserve the same rights and responsibilities that civil marriage offers straight couples.","Consumers don't need to be forced to pay billions for so-called smart technology to know how to reduce their utility bills. We know to turn down the heat or air conditioning and shut off the lights.","I often say that paying off your debt is like dieting. There are no miracle cures; it takes discipline and hard work.","In 2011, when the General Assembly passed the law allowing civil unions, Illinois took an important step forward to recognize that gay and lesbian couples have the right to build lives together and create strong, loving families.","Higher education is meant to provide economic opportunity to Americans - not provide unscrupulous companies the opportunity to syphon off billions in federal taxpayer dollars unfairly.","The explosive growth of the for-profit school industry has had disastrous effects on millions of Americans and our economy.","The Department of Education's refusal to oversee and hold for-profit schools accountable is a government-made disaster, and American students and taxpayers should not have to pay for it.","I'm very lucky to have the support of my family.","My husband helps take care of our kids.","It probably can take me anywhere I want to be, but I have to be honest, being attorney general is a great job.","I went to law school to help people.","Being attorney general has truly allowed me to be a voice for justice for the people of Illinois and oftentimes the country - and I love it.","I've always wanted to be an advocate.","I feel strongly that the state would not be well-served by having a governor and speaker of the House from the same family and have never planned to run for governor if that would be the case. With Speaker Madigan planning to continue in office, I will not run for governor.","I've been able to bring billions of dollars back to our state that has so desperately needed it - billions of dollars in relief to homeowners and our communities and our pension systems that desperately need it.","We've done amazing things for the state. Some of them have had a national impact, but I'm going to be ready for some new challenges, and so I'm not going to seek a fifth term as attorney general.","I've learned never to say never.","I enjoy a good fight, and always have, and really just said to myself, 'Look, at the end of my term, it'll be 16 years as attorney general, and I'm ready for new challenges. I'm ready to use my skills in a different way to continue to help people.'","The Attorney General must identify threats to Illinoisans' financial security and take action to protect people.","I initiated the State's investigation of Governor Blagojevich and have prosecuted public officials, including a sitting democratic state representative and democratic State's Attorney.","The Attorney General is the state's chief consumer advocate, fighting to protect the financial security of all Illinoisans.","I am inspired by Nelson Mandela. I was a volunteer teacher in South Africa during apartheid, where I witnessed his success liberating black South Africans.","Persons whose wagers depend upon how particular selected athletes perform in actual sporting events stand in no different stead than persons who wager on the outcome of any sporting event in which they are not participants.","There were absolutely circumstances where Sallie Mae was working hand-in-hand with for-profit schools and other schools in offering and putting students into risky expensive subprime loans.","My investigation found Sallie Mae put student borrowers into expensive subprime loans that it knew were going to fail.","Navient's actions have led to student borrowers needlessly carrying billions of dollars in debt, and the company must be held accountable.","Navient/Sallie Mae treated student loan borrowers unfairly from start to finish.","While I have supported marriage equality since my days as a state senator over a decade ago, I have since conducted an extensive legal analysis that has only emboldened my support as attorney general.","The last thing our children need is less protection.","Unlike public universities and private, not-for-profit colleges, for-profit schools are owned by revenue-seeking businesses often more intent on boosting their bottom line than educating their students. They use hard-sell tactics to recruit prospective students, and veterans have become particular targets.","Demand to know the school's accreditation. Regional accreditation is preferable to national, particularly if you want to transfer credits. Check with the certifying association or potential employer in your field to ensure successful completion of the program will actually qualify you for that job.","Even if you can afford the price of college, you cannot afford a worthless degree.","Do not enter into an agreement you cannot afford. Take precautions to avoid institutional loans with double-digit interest rates.","The creation of a consumer agency, structured similarly to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, levels the playing field. It gives consumers a powerful advocate at the federal level.","Much of the blame for the Great Recession lies with abuses in the housing market - namely the creation of risky and unsustainable home loans that were packaged and sold as quality investments around the globe.","The party on Wall Street never ends - while the rest of us pick up their tab and suffer the hangover.","Investigating some of the largest subprime lenders - Wells Fargo, Countrywide, Ameriquest, Household Finance - I've seen how their terrible, toxic loans were closed by any means necessary and eventually packaged, sold as securities, and bet upon until they exploded and decimated our economy.","I've repeatedly seen unscrupulous lenders use every con in the book to charm and lie to homeowners. Lenders actually paid brokers a premium to put people in higher-priced loans with toxic features, such as adjustable rates and prepayment penalties.","Your mortgage shouldn't have been treated as a wager - it should be a way to provide a home and financial stability for you and your family.","Hard work, careful planning, and realistic financial advice will be required by many to regain solvency.","While most of us are trying to be more frugal, the loss of a job, a divorce, or a medical emergency can quickly sink us deeply into debt.","If home ownership is the American dream, then foreclosure certainly is the American nightmare. It destroys more than credit. It destroys lives. And its effects are felt beyond the individual family that it devastates. It shakes our entire economy.","As I travel across Illinois and talk with people, and as others reach out to my office desperate for help, I am becoming convinced that, despite their rhetoric, many lenders have no interest in actually helping their customers.","For many, the loan modification process has been a giant sham.","Foreclosure is nothing new. And it certainly will always be a fact of life for some.","Most of our children have access to Internet-accessible technology, yet most of us are actually not paying much attention to what they're doing online."],"Lisa Marie Presley":["If I'm alone too long I think too much, and I'm not interested in doing that. That won't lead anywhere good, I'm sure. If I'm busy I tend to stay out of trouble. An idle mind is the devil's playground.","I would describe my aesthetic as definitely personal and harmonious with an eclectic yet bohemian sensibility.","I'm a hypochondriac. Yesterday it was brain damage from the vodka the night before. Today, heart attack - my arm and chest started hurting at the same time.","You are always learning; there is a lot of grey; don't take things for granted.","I'll say it loud and say it proud. I'm completely insane.","I think people think I'm harder and more arrogant and cocky than I am - because I know how to put on a front, but it's nothing like who I am inside.","I wanted to come through with my own voice and, hopefully, have it affect people. I want people to know that I'm not an Elvis impersonator.","I want to pave my own path artistically.","I live with the things that I love: art, furniture, and objects that I have collected throughout my travels.","I don't do yoga. I bite the hella outta my nails. I smoke, I eat all the wrong food, I don't exercise.","I dropped out of school in the 11th grade because there was no purpose in it for me. I'm not proud of this, and I'm not trying to promote it.","People that were in my life for a long time turned sinister and tried to control me, and all kinds of weird stuff happened. But there was no conscience involved; that threw me more than anything.","I have a tendency to kick it up. I like to rattle the cage.","How many people have a family grave in the backyard? I'm sure I'll end up there, or I'll shrink my head and put it in a glass box in the living room. I'll get more tourists to Graceland that way.","With a lot of hair and make-up then I'm possibly, remotely attractive. But it's rare, I don't think I'm ugly but I'm nothing particularly special. I'm not a yoga and health girl. I don't exercise that much and I eat crap and smoke and bite my nails.","I'm more of a tomboy than anything and then you see your name on these Top 50 Most Beautiful People lists and you're like, 'What?'","I think I've failed every test I've ever taken. If there was a failure I would have been it.","Being Elvis Presley's daughter is a whole lot of pressure. It's been a constant burden in my life.","I don't deal well with admiration if it's for something I haven't done. Other than exist.","I've been chased through airports with a screaming baby because the photographers are ruthless, and they want the picture.","I'm not doing this to be a pop star. I've had plenty of money and attention. I'm doing it for credibility.","I'm just not interested in selling out to get on the charts and make people happy.","I'm trying to have my own thing, and I don't know if it's even possible. I didn't realize so many people actually think I'm trying to be like my dad. I read comments like 'She's no Elvis.' I'm not trying to be. I never set out to be.","Mostly singing was cathartic, writing was cathartic, therapeutic. I don't think I had a goal, particularly, to sing or put it out there for anybody.","I really went back through a lot of the dark corridors of my life in this. I wanted people to know who I am based on my music, not on what they read in the tabloids.","I do like to write nasty songs. It's a useful weapon to have, and it's cathartic as well, because I create art out of anger, something positive out of something negative.","Music has always gotten me through life, particularly honest, real music.","I never not wanted to be a singer. Since I was 3, I knew this was what I wanted to do. Well, I can't say I wanted to do it, but I fantasized and thought about it all the time. I never thought it would actually happen.","On my US tour maybe three out of 30 shows there was an Elvis impersonator in the crowd but that's it. I usually get younger fans, and those that come that are of an older generation end up walking out because it's too loud.","I knew that because of who I am, and the situation I'm in, that I'd attract more critics than your average person, and that was a little intimidating, but I wanted to get out there and pay my dues.","I have a lot of memories, but I don't go into capitalizing on that. Something's got to be my own. I'm not doing the record to sit here and broadcast my memories of my father.","I like Jailhouse Rock and Love Me Tender. The black-and-white films. With music, I tend more toward the '70s stuff because I was at the shows for those, so they bring back memories.","I'm more prone to his '70s material, which is what I was around for and watched a lot. I listen to a lot of that stuff. It probably influenced me quite a bit. I'm more drawn to the darker, sadder songs.","I was quite the spoiled brat. I have quite a temper, obviously inherited from my father, and I became very good at ordering everyone around. I was the princess; the staff were absolutely terrified of me.","I was very protective of my father and I didn't like these people who hung around outside all day. They creeped me out.","I remember him watching me through the crack of a door singing with a hairbrush. I was in front of his mirror. I think he wanted me to sing. He would get me on the table and make me sing sometimes or play the piano. He was very encouraging on that front.","I'm not eager to jump into marriage again. I'm in the corner right now, wearing my dunce cap. That area is obviously a nightmare.","I've never even been out of my BMI range. I'm 5-foot-3. If I gain five pounds, it shows.","I'm a lot of work.","When I'm doing interviews, I'm doing interviews, and when I am writing, I'm writing. I sit there with a musician and I write. It's the same process since I started writing in my twenties. I like to come in and leave with a finished song.","I sit with the intention to write a record.","Between all four children and my husband, I don't get to do much. But when I am in England, I cook and I garden, and it's much more calming and relaxed.","I like helping children. I have a big thing with children. You can correspond with the child, send something to them as a gift. You know it's actually getting there and you are doing something to help.","I've been through so much in my life. I've seen so much. I know how fast things can change. I know someone can be here one minute and gone the next.","Anytime I was in Memphis with my dad and at the house, I was happy. That was, like, a given. It was what I lived for. And I still feel the same excitement and warmth.","It's hard for me to be happy because I'm always worried about something going awry or what could happen to screw it up. It's hard for me to sit and look around, going, 'Ah, I'm really happy.' I'm not that kind of person.","I've been through a lot of stuff.","Anybody in the spotlight can get lost in that if they are not careful.","If you lined up everyone I've ever dated, you wouldn't see any similarities.","I have, in the past, been attracted to really strong and dominant men. But on the other side, I have been attracted to very androgynous men. I don't typically fall for your average jock. I just like people that are a little atypical.","The period of time just before you awaken is the time I have my most creative thoughts and discover the best solutions.","I don't ascribe to any particular style or period.","I grew up in the South with my father; blues and country, that's always been my core. But I had it in me not to do what was expected. I wanted to find my own footing.","When I write, it's purging for me. It's a therapeutic process.","I take a situation, analyse it, break it down, put it in the form I want it to be in, and then I toss it away. Let somebody else go deal with it.","Something happens to people around fame and power and money - it can bring out the worst and best in people; it's a monster you have to tame.","I went through a huge transition in my life where everything and everyone I knew and trusted didn't turn out to be that way.","I have loved music so much from when I was little, and I don't know whether it was because I saw my dad doing it and then I got the idea; I don't know what came first... But I always had a hairbrush in the mirror singing. I was always with him backstage; I would go out and be pulled in for the last song.","I have always been a singer/songwriter, and I was pushed in places I didn't want to do, like pop or top forty. I don't belong there.","I want to write, I want to sing. I want to do the same thing for others, have my music, hopefully do that for others one day, not realizing what I sort of had to climb. I had an idea a little bit, but I think that I underestimated the whole thing.","I don't think that I'm a top 40 artist in any way. So I don't think I'm that mainstream.","I work because I think that I wouldn't feel good about myself unless I was contributing.","I always loved singing and writing poetry. I always loved music, and I've loved writing my whole life. When I put them together, it was probably in my early 20s where I put words to music for the first time.","I was always writing music anyway. I just sort of fell into it. Writing for me is a therapeutic process.","I think having kids just makes you want to do things to help people. You have children, and you see how fragile and innocent and helpless they are when they first start out. If they are going to be a victim of whatever they are surrounded by, I just do everything I can to try to make whatever change I can.","I'm one of those people that, if I hear about something happening, I go crazy. I want to go help."],"Lisa McMann":["Who hasn't had the 'I went to school/work in my underwear' dream?","I was a blueberry picker, bindery worker, bookstore clerk and later manager, and a Realtor.","I went to Holland Christian High School in Holland, Michigan, and to Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan.","I would love to go to Greece.","I love Chris Crutcher, Sara Zarr, Lois Lowry, Elizabeth Scott, Madeleine L'Engle, Gordon Korman, Michelle Magorian, Heather Bouwman.","I had one of those defining moments in the fourth grade when my teacher said the story I wrote was the best in the class, and therefore I would be going Young Authors Conference where I'd get to hang out with authors all day.","One of my favorite ways to write paranormal, as in the 'Wake' trilogy, is to write very normal characters with just a hint of something other-worldly. Like somewhere, maybe, someone really can get sucked into other people's dreams.","Seriously, I dreamed that I was in my husband's dream, watching what he was dreaming about. Like, I was in his dream as an onlooker. It was so weird that I immediately wrote it down in the middle of the night. In the morning, it still sounded cool.","I would like to be able to disappear whenever I do something dorky.","I've always found teenagers really interesting. I think they've got so much going on in their lives, so that lends itself really well to fiction because there's so much drama, so much activity, so much growth.","I don't see a day when teenagers don't read. They are very enthusiastic. That is so inspiring to me.","I vividly remember sixth grade. It's the year when kids turn mean, and it's definitely no longer okay to cry in public. So we force our hot tears back, and they burn our throats all the way down.","Nearly every notable event in 'Wake' has a date or a time stamp."],"Lisa Morton":["Some say I'm an overnight success. Well, that was a very long night that lasted about 10 years.","There haven't been organized protests, but I have heard of protests where people have wanted to celebrate Halloween.","In Britain, the major public holiday used to be Guy Fawkes Day... that was celebrated on November 5th with things like bonfires and fireworks... I think that made Halloween seem preferable. The idea of having pumpkins and costumes and parties seemed much more appealing than burning down your neighborhood.","South Africa is the only place in the Southern hemisphere where Halloween is really catching on. They have a lot of sporting events that have made it more popular there. They have motocross and rave celebrations, and they're embracing it as a youth culture thing.","For about 30 years, Halloween was taken over by pranksters. By the '30s, pranks were causing cities millions of dollars of damage. They considered banning Halloween in many cities, but instead, parents got together and came up with party ideas for kids, and a lot of them involved dressing up and costuming.","I simply love writing good stories; that's my passion.","I write what I'd like to read and just hope that, along the way, others might like to read them, too.","While I do, of course, now feel the pressure having had books that have been very successful, I just know I have to concentrate on writing for myself. I can't worry about genres or markets or what might be commercial or not. That never works."],"Lisa Murkowski":["I look at my cell phone to see what time it is where I am, and then you behave accordingly. If people are eating, it must be time to eat.","I'm a firm believer that if you put together a good product that is just good policy, that is embraced by both sides so that it is seen as politically advantageous to the Republicans or Democrats, that even in this very polarized partisan world that you can advance legislation. I have to believe that, or I wouldn't want to get up every morning.","The more traditional fuel sources we have relied on as a nation - coal, oil, and natural gas - I'm hoping they can allow us the financial springboard to move to the next generation of energy sources: renewables and alternatives.","Freedom comes from strength and self-reliance.","I have nice watches. I don't set them.","The Voting Rights Act of 1965 brought an end to the ugly Jim Crow period in American history.","We need to face it, as a nation we have a reliance on petroleum.","Think about how our country was built. The greatness came from our diversity; the greatness came from individuals with different perspectives coming together.","I do believe that Planned Parenthood provides vital services to those in need and disagree with its funding cuts contained in the H.R. 1 package.","The thought of losing Ted Stevens, a man who was known to business and community leaders, Native chiefs and everyday Alaskans as Uncle Ted, is too difficult to fathom. He truly was the greatest of the Greatest Generation.","Our hunting areas are the grocery store.","I am working for Alaska's best interests.","America's neighbors are not drilling for fun or for sport; they've chosen to proceed to create new jobs, generate new revenues, and increase the energy supply and prosperity of their citizens.","Seniority actually means something in the Senate.","We fail to boost our offshore production at our own expense.","I have never once asked Alaskans to like how I got this job.","The war against terrorism is one we must win.","There are many outsiders that actively try to halt every natural resource development project in Alaska. Many of these same people have never even been to Alaska, yet they claim to know what's best for us.","I don't buy into this, 'Oh, poor us. We've got tough budget problems.'","We've been helping you out in Alaska in considerable ways, and you're walking away from the responsibility, and we're not going to allow that.","Whether it was his ability to turn around the Massachusetts economy or turn around businesses in the private sector, Mitt Romney has demonstrated the leadership that we need in the White House to get the country on the right track.","Mitt Romney understands the importance of Alaska as a leader in our country's energy production and I look forward to working with him on such an important economic and national security matter.","I have nothing against President McKinley whatsoever, but I would rather have this peak be called by the name it has gone by for centuries by Alaskans than a man who never set foot in our state. This is the tallest mountain in North America, and we deserve to have this Alaskan landmark bear an Alaskan name.","I am not one of those who wants Obama to fail. If he does well, that means the country's doing well.","We don't have time as a nation to spend all of what we do blocking.","I think there are a lot of outside interests that would like to see Sarah Palin in some form of elected office. Most in Alaska recognize our former governor is really not involved in or engaged in the state anymore, that she's moved to other interests.","In order to represent the state, you've got to be in the state.","Keep in mind, our demographics of our state, how it breaks down in terms of political affiliation: over half the people in this state chose not to align themselves with any party at all.","Scott McAdams is a nice guy, but I don't know that most Alaskans believe that he's electable.","When you think about the children, one of the things that I'm quite concerned about - and I've heard it expressed by others - is trying to find how we can build better accountability, work to provide a level of education that prepares our children for the future.","What people unfortunately relate to when they think of Alaska oil was when the Exxon Valdez went aground because of a captain that was drunk. But when you look to how we have been safely producing and moving Alaska's oil for decades, it is a track record that is enviable.","I'm working for my state first.","It doesn't make sense to argue about how much global warming is caused by man - whether it's 5 percent or 50 percent.","You shouldn't say, 'Well, we cannot go there,' before we even had the conversation.","We can write the book on how to run a successful write-in campaign for the United States Senate.","What you get when you elect Lisa Murkowski is you get somebody who builds on that legacy that Ted Stevens built for our state for 40 years that continues on that path, that trajectory, to helping a young state like Alaska build us out.","We do not have the transportation infrastructure that all you in the lower 48 have. We don't have energy grids that tie us in.","What I am delivering to Alaska is a future that holds hope and opportunity for jobs, for people in this state.","With the notion of marriage - an exclusive, emotional, binding 'til death do you part' tie - becoming more and more an exception to the rule given a rise in cohabitation and high rates of divorce, why should the federal government be telling adults who love one another that they cannot get married simply because they happen to be gay?","I believe when there are so many forces pulling our society apart, we need more commitment to marriage, not less.","Like the majority of Alaskans, I supported a constitutional amendment in 1998 defining marriage as only between a man and a woman, but my thinking has evolved as America has witnessed a clear cultural shift.","From 2002-2008, Planned Parenthood received $342 million in federal taxpayer money through Title X funding alone. With these funds, Planned Parenthood has provided women throughout the U.S. with important family planning and contraceptive services as well as screening for breast and cervical cancers for low-income women.","I believe it is important that Title X organizations continue to receive funding.","I'm not - I'm not going to define people by labels: who's a real Republican, who's not a real Republican.","What I look at is, do you represent the values of the state of Alaska? Do you represent the people here in terms of what it is that they need, they hope for, what they hope for their future? And Joe Miller simply does not represent that.","I've been working to make sure that we've got adequate transportation. I've been working to make sure that we can afford energy within our villages and in our communities.","To most Alaskans, Clinton is remembered as being the one individual who has shut Alaska down by vetoing ANWR when we successfully moved it through the Congress.","If there's anybody who is recognized as the one guy who has stymied Alaskan development, it's Bill Clinton.","Alaskans deserve a fighter in the United States Senate who will always stand up for Alaska, who understands our great potential, who has the experience, respect and seniority to accomplish that. I am that senator.","I don't pass the Tea Party's purity test.","For eight years, I've served on the Indian Affairs committee, two years as the ranking member. I've been on that committee since Day One. I will stay on the committee for as long as I'm in the Senate because of my commitment to making a difference for Alaska Natives.","People think that every day we pass monumental legislation. Oftentimes, the most important thing that you have done that day is help a family with a visa.","I am not looking for a pound of flesh from Sally Jewell.","I will do everything, everything in my power, for as long as I am here, to enable the people of King Cove to receive proper emergency access that the rest of us take for granted.","Statutory authority to improve fuel economy has existed for 35 years at the Transportation Department, and it still exists today.","I still wear my write-in wristband. It used to be plastic, but my husband turned it into gold.","I am not here as my party's nominee. I am unique among the 100 senators in that regard.","One thing that Alaskans clearly appreciate is seniority.","I think it's fair to say that women have a different level of intuitiveness that allows them to perhaps handle situations a little bit different.","There are times when you need to pitch a fit and other times when you need to apply Catholic guilt, and it's just figuring out which is the most appropriate approach and then implementing it.","I was advised by my assistant that the women of the Senate don't do potlucks. To which I responded, 'Of course we do.'","It is fundamentally important in our system of government that every American be given the opportunity to vote, regardless of who they are, where they live, and what their race or national origin may be.","I don't fit neatly into anybody's political boxes, and I think that sometimes disturbs people. But I don't think most Alaskans fit neatly into the Republican box or the Democratic box. They don't think of themselves that way.","We can sit between active drilling operations in neighboring countries, complaining that it's too risky to develop our own resources while the world around us does exactly that.","Imagine that foreign development is not done to our standards and a spill occurs. Neither geology nor ocean currents will respect our national boundaries.","I am still a Republican. I have not changed that.","I will be sent back to Washington, D.C., with the grace of God and all the Alaskan voters out there because all Alaskans have asked me to go back and continue my service.","I think Alaskans expect me to think, to think about them and do the right thing for them.","I'm all about accessing our resources; I'm all about those jobs. But I want to make sure I'm not expensing one for the other.","When you put in place regulations that are so burdensome, so tough, so much so that they cripple your economy, we then don't have the resources to invest in technologies that are going to make that difference, because it's just going to shut everything down. That's not going to help us as an economy.","I was returned to the Senate by the people of Alaska, and I have an obligation to all of them - it's not an obligation to my party; it's an obligation to Alaskans.","I'm not a quitter - never have been.","I believe that, as Americans, our freedoms come from God and not government, and include the rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.","What could be more important to the pursuit of happiness than the right to choose your spouse without asking a Washington politician for permission?","If there is one belief that unifies most Alaskans - our true north - it is less government and more freedom. We don't want the government in our pockets or our bedrooms; we certainly don't need it in our families.","Any efforts or opportunity to expand the civil bonds and rights to anyone that wants to build a stable, happy household should be promoted.","So much of what we do addresses the issues that are associated with climate change, whether it's working to reduce emissions, whether it's working to nail down our renewables, whether it's ensuring great efficiency in accessing all of our energy sources.","I did not believe and I do not believe that Planned Parenthood should be defunded.","I've supported the repeal of ObamaCare.","We still have billions of barrels in Alaska that sit untapped. There are abundant reserves offshore in the lower 48.","We owe it to ourselves to keep healthy this marvelous world we've been given.","A lot of the basic research that helped us figure out fracking came from the federal government.","Alaskans need some certainty and clarity over how the Pebble Partnership intends to proceed. I understand the complexity of a project like this, and I appreciate the investments that have been made in Alaska already. But a reliable timeline has been missing, and I hope that the companies will provide one soon.","I want to support John Boehner in any way that I can, but we need to be pragmatic.","We have so many issues in this country to focus on that worry us, that I question why there is such focus on the simple right of people to love whom they will.","I believe marriages should be legally defined as between one man and one woman.","I have voted in support of efforts in the Senate to enact a Constitutional amendment that would have limited marriage to one man and one woman only.","I've got two young sons who, when I ask them and their friends how they feel about gay marriage, kinda give me one of those looks like, 'Gosh, Mom, why are you even asking that question?'","We talk a lot in Congress about how we're going to encourage more development in renewables, and we put in place a subsidy that's good for two years. Then Congress argues and bickers over whether or not we're going to extend it. As a consequence, nothing happens because we've put so much uncertainty into the prospect of these subsidies.","How we move forward with a level of R&D support that will be meaningful allows us to really build on and enhance our energy opportunities in this country.","I look at what we have - our traditional natural resource base - as helping move us to that cleaner, more diverse energy supply.","It's much more powerful to say I'm working to reduce spending, deal with our nation's deficit, push back on the federal government, and give specifics for that rather than just say, 'I'm a conservative.'","I think that the ability to export our abundant resources of LNG is good for us and quite honestly helps with the balance-of-trade issue. Japan would love to see LNG coming from its friend and closest ally, the United States.","You've got to move us to these technologies that allow us to get to the clean-energy source. If we can't work to reduce the cost, you're not going to see them implemented unless there is a path of unlimited subsidies, and that's not doable, either. We can kick-start the research process, but we have to do that from a position of economic strength.","I'm not afraid to spend money on the R&D that's really going to move us to a cleaner energy source that I think is so much the answer to the issues of environmental responsibility and climate change.","I'm not a gym rat. I've got a gym membership, but my schedule is so crazy I just can't keep it regular.","I wish that I could tell you that I have a season ski pass, but I have had to give that up since I've been in the Senate."],"Lisa Nicole Carson":["It's definitely an exciting time to be an actress.","Life is a full meal.","It helps if you really enjoy your jobs. If you don't, then just think about the money.","I'm unable to ignore the gift that God gave me, so I'm going to sing.","Finally, the complexities of black relationships are being portrayed in television and film."],"Lisa O'Hare":["Audrey Hepburn is someone I've always admired. She has that untouchable star quality.","'My Fair Lady' will never get old for me.","I like to think I'm not a narcissist, but truth be told, we all have those sides to our character.","I lived and breathed dancing. It was my everything.","I've always known that performing is what I want to do. There was never a defining moment. I just came out that way.","My auntie Anne took me to 'Phantom of the Opera' in London. I thought it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.","I have to admit that I get quite emotional listening to the amazing talent that exists in the New York subways."],"Lisa Papademetriou":["My grandmother was German. She was an immigrant, and my great grandfather fought in World War I and was stationed in France.","I was a huge rereader, so I've read all the Chronicles of Narnia, at minimum, 13 times each. In reading that series, I realized that someone had written those books, and that was that person's job. And I thought, 'That is the job for me. That is the job I'm going to have when I grow up.'","I graduated from my Master of Fine Arts program for writing for children and young adults at Vermont College of Fine Arts. Of course, for a master's program, you have to do a ton of reading. I would get up, usually around 5:30, to do my reading; otherwise, I would fall behind.","I read a lot of fantasy as a kid. I read 'The Hobbit' and all of the 'Lord of the Rings' books, but I also read a lot of realism like 'The Outsiders.'"],"Lisa Randall":["Scientific research involves going beyond the well-trodden and well-tested ideas and theories that form the core of scientific knowledge. During the time scientists are working things out, some results will be right, and others will be wrong. Over time, the right results will emerge.","An almost indispensable skill for any creative person is the ability to pose the right questions. Creative people identify promising, exciting, and, most important, accessible routes to progress - and eventually formulate the questions correctly.","I considered going into business or becoming a lawyer - not for the money, but for the thrill of problem-solving.","The best science frequently combines an awareness of broad and significant problems with focus on an apparently small issue or detail that someone very much wants to solve or understand. Sometimes these little problems or inconsistencies turn out to be the clues to big advances.","When I was in school, I liked math because all the problems had answers. Everything else seemed very subjective.","Creativity is essential to particle physics, cosmology, and to mathematics, and to other fields of science, just as it is to its more widely acknowledged beneficiaries - the arts and humanities.","Neuroscience is exciting. Understanding how thoughts work, how connections are made, how the memory works, how we process information, how information is stored - it's all fascinating.","You have principles. You test them as accurately as you can. Eventually, they might break down.","We live in a world where there are many risks, and it's high time we start taking seriously which ones we should be worried about.","The scientist is also a composer... You could think of science as discovering one particular thing - a supernova or whatever. You could also think of it as discovering this whole new way of seeing the world.","Travel at faster than the speed of light certainly can have dramatic implications that are difficult to understand, such as time travel.","People who dismiss science in favor of religion sometimes confuse the challenge of rigorously understanding the world with a deliberate intellectual exclusion that leads them to mistrust scientists and, to their detriment, what they discover.","Scientific experiments are expensive, and people are entitled to know about them if they want to. I think it is very difficult to convey ideas.","Both religions and musicals work best with energetic and committed believers. Cynicism or detachment would have destroyed the magic - something true of religion, too.","Physicists have yet to understand why the Higgs boson's mass is what it is.","You learn that the interest is in what you don't yet know and that theories evolve. But we nonetheless have progress and improved knowledge over time.","I don't think about a theory of everything when I do my research. And even if we knew the ultimate underlying theory, how are you going to explain the fact that we're sitting here? Solving string theory won't tell us how humanity was born.","I think simplicity is a good guide: The more economical a theory, the better.","You have to be careful when you use beauty as a guide. There are many theories people didn't think were beautiful at the time but did find beautiful later - and vice versa.","In the history of physics, every time we've looked beyond the scales and energies we were familiar with, we've found things that we wouldn't have thought were there. You look inside the atom, and eventually you discover quarks. Who would have thought that?","The thing I will say is that probably culturally, women are treated differently, which means, I think, you're criticized more, you have to listen a little bit more, you have to justify yourself.","I can be a good listener. I can ask the right questions a lot of the time.","I don't think we have reached a point where art really translates into science. Perhaps for some people, having good visuals can help translate into science.","In fairness, I don't think that everyone understands what I say, but I think they understand part of it and part of what the issues are... Just the same way that people like a good painting, I think people really like understanding, knowing about the world.","I actually like seeing how the world - trying to figure out how the world works, how it all fits together. Also, it makes me happy when I feel like things are consistent, when there's some sort of order to the universe.","What I do is very theoretical. It won't necessarily have implications for anything anyone is doing tomorrow, yet you know that there's a sense of progress in science, and as we understand more, it just turns out that, somehow, the world evolves with us.","Religion can have psychological and social roles, but in terms of really explaining how things work, science works differently. Science is based on material elements at the core.","I really do think that science has an internal structure, and it makes sense, and we can test it.","I was always good at math, but I was good at everything. It sounds obnoxious, but I was just smart. In school, it's kind of obvious when you're learning things faster than other kids.","When you're reaching out to people beyond the scientific community, image does matter.","If you keep telling girls they're less good at science, that will probably be self-fulfilling. But there are quite a lot of women who are good at it.","There are women for whom family is a priority, and they do it. It just wasn't as much a priority for me.","I do theoretical particle physics. We're trying to understand the most basic structure of matter. And the way you do that is you have to look at really small distances. And to get to small distances, you need high energies.","We have this very clean picture of science, you know, these well-established rules with which we make predictions. But when you're really doing science, when you're doing research, you're at the edge of what we know.","I would say it's important for scientists to speak out when they can and when they can be listened to.","There could be more to the universe than the three dimensions we are familiar with. They are hidden from us in some way, perhaps because they're tiny or warped. But even if they're invisible, they could affect what we actually observe in the universe.","There is real confusion about what it means to be right and wrong - the difference between what spiritual beliefs are and what science is.","There are a lot of mysteries about quantum mechanics, but they mostly arise in very detailed measurements in controlled settings.","I started out working on supersymmetry. The theory predicts that for every particle we know about, there will be an additional particle.","The standard model of particle physics describes forces and particles very well, but when you throw gravity into the equation, it all falls apart. You have to fudge the figures to make it work.","If you look through the shelves of science books, you'll find row after row of books written by men. This can be terribly off-putting for women.","You can be only a modest distance away from the gravity brane, and gravity will be incredibly weak.","It's not completely obvious what gravity is, fundamentally, or what dimensions are, fundamentally. One of these days we'll understand better what we mean, what is the fundamental thing that's given us space in the first place and dimensions of space in particular.","Physicists are interested in measuring neutrino properties because they tell us about the structure of the Standard Model, the well-tested theory that describes matter's most basic elements and interactions.","Most physicists like myself won't believe the result until every possible caveat has been investigated and/or the result is confirmed elsewhere.","For me, the most absorbing films are those that address big questions and real ideas but embody them in small examples that we can appreciate and comprehend.","A musical, like most religions, provides the audience or followers with a sense of belonging. Religious services, on the other hand, with their staged performances, invigorating songs, popular wisdom and shared experience, are almost a form of community theater.","Organized religion and musicals present tenets to live by that don't entirely make sense but, on the whole, make people who believe them secure, thus giving an appearance of inclusiveness.","There can sometimes be this fear among laypeople: 'I don't understand everything in science perfectly, so I just can't say anything about it.' I think it's good to know that we scientists are also confused some of the time.","The process of science is difficult and challenging. It involves always being aware that your ideas might be right or they might be wrong. I think it's that kind of balance that makes science so interesting.","I grew up in New York City. I went to museums so much as a kid, and I guess I didn't realize how much it affected me.","I don't necessarily make much art myself, but after I wrote 'Warped Passages,' I was fortunate to get involved a little in the art world. I got invited to write a libretto for what we called a projective opera, and I also got invited to curate an art exhibit.","I really like that my work is getting more people interested in science.","What makes me different as a scientist is that I'm kind of imaginative. The ideas just happen.","If you are a responsible scientist, you are going to present your new results in a paper, and maybe if, over time, things are established, and it's prime time for the public to hear about it, then you include it in a book.","When I came to Harvard, I was debating between math and science, and I guess I thought in the end I wanted something that could connect to the real world. I liked puzzle-solving and connections.","I do try to do high-impact work, and I try to think of ideas people haven't thought about that have broad implications, but I don't restrict myself to that. I try to work on things that I find interesting.","Harvard freshmen are smart, interested, and excited, and it's fun hearing their different perspectives and stuff that they will share."],"Lisa Rinna":["I love my shoulders; they're strong. I like the way they move, and I like the way they look in clothes.","I find that we must be careful not to judge or weigh in on anything other than ourselves. I am living and learning this still!","I never had a career before I had the lips, so my lips have had their own career!","Can dancing change your life? Yes. It's changed mine. What I've learned is, it's not about how good you are technically. It's about your soul coming through. It's about having fun.","In our house, everybody is always dancing around and singing. We have a dance floor outside at our house, a big, huge dance floor that we all dance on.","I've been athletic since I was a kid. My parents got me playing tennis when I was seven years old and I started to play competitively.","When I was 16, I discovered jazzercise. And I thought it was the greatest thing since peanut butter and jelly.","I want everybody to succeed. It's just part of who I am. I probably do that with my kids tenfold. I'm as insecure as the next person, but it doesn't ever take me over."],"Lisa Scottoline":["I love the dignity in the name Philadelphia, but at heart, we're Philly.","I love everything about Philadelphia, and its food is like the city itself: real-deal, hearty, and without pretension. We've always had an underdog vibe as a city, but that just makes us try harder, and I love our scrappiness and scruffiness.","I am really, I think, truly an easygoing, positive, fun person.","I am an open book, literally. I don't mind if people know way too much about me.","My animals are a really important part of my life.","What I'm doing is writing stories about women who care about justice. They are women who think about the difference between right and wrong, what's legal and illegal, ethical and unethical, moral and immoral.","I still think I'm writing Nancy Drew with a mortgage.","I was a lawyer and I loved it, but my Francesca was born, and a divorce followed way too soon after.","Truly I never thought of myself as writing legal thrillers, and I still don't think I do. I write stories about women.","But the fact is, I'm not work-identified. I'm not a lawyer or a writer. I'm a mom, and I'm a woman, and that's the kind of people I want to see in books in the starring role.","You can really help support a character if you understand the setting. So for that reason I generally write about Philadelphia.","If it weren't for book tours, I would never leave my house.","Even if it's not what you planned, you can make a life for yourself on your own and be happy.","And when I look at my mother, I reflect on her strength and endurance. She's cranky sometimes, but she is lovable and loving. I'd be happy to be there at 86.","Truth is, every writer has to be a good editor, and you have to edit yourself. It's a skill every writer has to acquire.","I get up around 8 o'clock, which gives me enough time to walk dogs and feed chickens and horses. Then I get to work in my home office upstairs, and basically, I don't stop until I've written 2,000 words and/or the Stephen Colbert show is over.","I love writing both fiction and memoir. Both have unique challenges; bottom line, fiction is hard because you have to come up with the credible, twisty plot, and memoir is hard because you have to say something true and profound, albeit in a funny way.","The truth is that every writer, whether it's fiction or nonfiction, is trying to write something truly original and that's what I think I'm doing.","Any middle-aged woman knows that our feet are not for the faint of heart, especially in midwinter. I wear clogs, so it's actually like my feet are wooden now.","And wouldn't we be better off if every New Year's, we thought about the things we did right and we resolved to keep doing them, no matter how wacky they were.","I like terrific writing, but I also like a terrific story. My favorite books have both, and they're by contemporary, commercial American writers.","You don't have to be dead to write a classic, and you don't have to be literary to be smart.","I love my job, and I love books. I read anything, including cereal boxes. I care deeply about what people think of my books, and I memorize my reviews. I love to hear from my readers."],"Lisa See":["People come in and out of our lives, and the true test of friendship is whether you can pick back up right where you left off the last time you saw each other.","Nu shu means women's writing. And it was a secret writing system that was invented by women, used by women and kept a secret by women in one very remote county in China for a thousand years. It's the only language that was invented and used by women to have been found anywhere in the world.","It used to happen in villages and towns in China that they would have - I guess you'd call them beauty contests - where all of the women of a particular village or town would be seated behind these screens or curtains with only their feet showing.","I think all women have a friend who at some point dumped them or betrayed them or deeply disappointed them. And at the same time all women have a friend who they dumped or betrayed or hurt in some way. That's universal in women's friendships.","My hardcover sales are 17% down in books but up 400% in electronics.","But there are certain books I would never put on a Kindle because you want to be able to look at graphs and photos or the footnotes and maps. You can't see that.","I love research. I'd go so far as to say I'm a research fanatic.","Opera tells stories through the pure emotion of music. An exhibition has to tell a story purely visually. I've tried to incorporate both of those things - pure emotion and being more visual - into my writing.","I write what I'm interested in.","I write a thousand words a day.","I don't really know anything about the movie business, even though I've lived in Los Angeles my whole life - somehow I've never bumped into it.","But, you know, I just did a big trip in the spring to Vietnam and Cambodia and Thailand, and that's when I bought a Kindle. I have like 15 books on this one little gizmo. But when I came home, the first night I picked up the book that was on my nightstand and I went right back to that.","A book is one kind of an art form and a film is a different art form. I think as a writer you just have to say, well the book is one thing, and the film is a completely different one.","I think sometimes as an adult, you take people for what they do, and what they are now, instead of the whole picture of their lives.","I am an eighth Chinese, and I come from a large Chinese-American family in Los Angeles.","Some of what I am doing when I am researching is looking for things people in my family have done and finding out what those things mean, why they did those things and seeing how I fit into them.","People write to me all the time, and I write back.","I think to really be literate in nu shu you only need about 600 characters because it is phonetic. So you're able to then create many words out of one character.","One of the things that's pretty unique about nu shu, when you look especially at these old letters and stories that have been saved, is that there are certain lines that are very standard that are used again and again. It's almost like a formula in a sense, so that these certain lines come up again and again.","And one of the interesting things about bound feet is that they never age.","And often it would be a woman who was in her 70s or 80s who would win the beauty contest, because bound feet never age."],"Lisa Snowdon":["In my hand luggage I always have my camera, iPod, make-up bag, tooth brush, cleansing products, clean underwear, socks and a change of clothes in case anything goes missing at the other end - and of course my passport.","Well I've got lots more great TV projects in the pipeline.","Sex keeps me in shape. I don't diet, I eat what I like. I love Mars bars and I smoke and drink. But I love running off in the middle of the day to make love. It really burns up calories.","If I'm going away for longer than a week I take a suitcase and check it in but I'm good at packing light and quick - years of modelling, travelling and living out of a suitcase has trained me well.","I really only ever go on sun holidays so in my experience I prepare myself for the beach.","I use fake tan myself with a self tanning spray.","I like to browse in Cartier, Chanel and Gucci and if something special grabs my eye I splash out.","I enjoy popping in to World Duty Free at the airport and trying out perfumes - I can never resist a new scent.","On long haul flights I always drink loads and loads of water and eat light and healthy food.","I can still jump on the Tube. I don't want that to change.","It was my first big relationship and it was just very abusive. I wouldn't give him the credit of naming him, if he ever reads this. But he was older, in the music business - or so he said.","My parents were divorcing, and I think at certain times of your life you do attract the wrong type of person. You don't know any better, and you don't know how you'd like to be treated.","I'm a real home girl.","I'm the oldest and I've got two sisters.","And my parents' separation was tricky. But my mum had always been really honest with me, and treated me like an adult even when I was really young, so I knew they hadn't been getting on.","Americans love our shoes and us Brits love that we can always pick up a bargain when in the US.","I think I'm slightly impulsive, sometimes organised and always in search of a bargain!","I'm on VH1 now, will be working on ITV's This Morning again from September."],"Lisa Tuttle":["My own novel, 'The Silver Bough,' about the inhabitants of a remote town at risk of being overwhelmed by Scotland's mythological past, was once criticised by a disgruntled fan as 'fantasy for people who don't read fantasy.'","I can't remember a time when I didn't write or make up stories, because it seemed to come with reading.","I used to think, 'I'm going to write.' I knew that from quite early on, but I also thought, 'Maybe I'll be an explorer or a spy,' and it all came from books.","The 1970s were so wonderful for women writers. There were all these women, and they were seen as doing the most interesting, innovative and exciting stuff in science fiction. I was inspired by that.","I'm quite a rational person, but I'm drawn to the irrational. I love coincidences, and I like to question that in fiction: 'Is this random, or is there something working underneath?'"],"Lisa Unger":["I've always had this in a kind of worst-case dark imagination. I want to know what the dark form in the window is. I want to know what the noise under the staircase is.","Maybe I have this fascination with the dark side because I live in the light. I don't have any dysfunction, and I've never experienced trauma.","I live for the blank page.","I don't remember a time when I didn't define myself as a writer.","There's nothing particularly dark in my past... I live in the light. My disposition is basically happy. I have a good life.","If I weren't a writer, I'd be a psychiatrist.","I definitely feel that plot flows from character. I don't believe that you can construct a plot and insert people into it.","I don't think of my characters as people I create, I think of them more as people I have met and whom I'm exploring on the page. I don't actually think of myself as having 'created' any of these people.","I'm a 'bound book' kind of girl. I have a Kindle, and I enjoy it for some things, like convenience or instant gratification, or all the little things that you can do with them.","I love a big, character-rich story with a dark heart, with a compelling mystery or some kind of ticking clock at its center. I want to be lured in by prose, captured by character, and bound by stellar plotting to keep turning the pages.","I read 'Rebecca' when I was a teenager and was swept away by the powerful voice, the gut wrenching suspense and the dark, twisted love story at its center.","'In Cold Blood' is not a thriller at all, really. It is, however, the first work of its kind: a true crime book that reads like fiction.","Truman Capote was a magical, beautiful writer.","There's a village in my computer - friends, fans, readers, and colleagues. It's a populous, sometimes chaotic little burg always bustling with news, gossip, opinions and potential excitement.","The business of writing a novel is a long, meandering road into the self, into the imagination. And it's a road the writer travels alone.","I love the village in my computer. There's little validation in the day-to-day life of a writer; sometimes we ache for a connection.","Of course, like all organic processes, there is an ebb and a flow to writing. One does not exist without the other. The writer needs to be vigilant in protecting both, confident in the knowledge that the village will be there when we choose, finally, to open the door.","Publishing is a business of relationships. The relationships you make at one house can carry over to another.","The worst violence we can do to each other often is psychological, especially in families. I dwell a lot on domestic danger. That's the backdrop of most of my novels - what kind of damage is done without ever lifting a finger.","I was always the observer, trying to understand what was going on. I was always the new kid. Writing became my safe place.","I write for the same reason I read: to find out what's going to happen.","Everything is autobiographical, and nothing is autobiographical. That's fiction."],"Lisa Vanderpump":["In Beverly Hills, it's very spoiled in terms of the quality of life. I think the climate and the space and the quality of life in Beverly Hills is exceptional.","I'm a very passionate person. I do everything times 10.","I don't really care what others think of me. You're not going to please everybody. I care what I think and what my children and my husband thinks.","I have a hard time keeping a story straight when I tell the truth because when you start lying you have to remember what you said, and I'm not very good at that.","Find what you love to do and you'll never work a day in your life, that's true. But also always try to fill a niche. What can you try to do that is different?","I don't watch any television, hardly ever because I'm so busy. I always obviously watch my shows because I blog about it and talk about it, but no, I can watch the news in the morning and that's it.","I don't really lie about anything, I have to be honest. I like to live with the truth.","I've never been given a ticket by a police man.","You can film me 24 hours a day and you'll get a very accurate picture of who I am. You see the funny side, I work hard, and I try to be honest and just call it how it is.","I don't think a man should try to suppress a woman just because he's married to her.","My kids would not get in to bed every night without me telling them that I loved them.","I'm also interested in pets with alopecia. And design. I'm surprised I haven't gone through with a homeware brand. The bedding, the comforters, the candles, the this and that. I would like to design everything.","Music makes or breaks an atmosphere. It helps to create the mood and also is a very important aural cue; simply shut off the music when you want people to leave.","I often find that the best parents are the ones without children."],"Lisa Vidal":["When you want something so badly, you just do it. You don't think about how hard it's going to be.","When I'm home, I'm just mom. We're a normal, regular family doing normal, regular types of things.","All three of my kids play soccer. Each one of them started from the time they were about 5 or 6, and we just love it.","Latinos that are in the industry writing and producing, they can't be afraid to go out there and say, 'I want my lead to be Latino. And I want to talk about this, I wanna write about that.' And Latinos as a whole, as a people in America, need to go out and support.","I do a combo of running, weights, and core exercises and try to work out at least three times a week.","Aging in Hollywood sucks. There's always so much pressure to look way younger than you are, and everyone's watching! I'd like to embrace getting older, because it's kind of inevitable. The different, wiser me, to be at peace with how I look and I'm supposed to look - it's a work in progress.","I did a film called 'Victor' that I'm really proud of! It was a period piece and the true life story of Victor Torres. I play his mom, and it's a very moving film.","I'm involved with Children's Hospital Los Angeles. I love anything that helps and improves the life of children."],"Lisa Whelchel":["There's something about childhood friends that you just can't replace.","I'm hosting weekend retreats all over America. It is like a 24-hour slumber party for moms. We laugh, eat, play games, get massages, win prizes, talk about parenting and even cry a bit.","My job is to pay attention to my children's genius and allow those leanings to lead them to their future.","My purpose is to refuel, refresh and rejuvenate moms.","I believe that God has a specific plan and reason He created each one of us.","I have written about 10 books, all just practical encouragement for moms.","Families homeschool for different reasons, in unique situations, using a variety of methods.","I've been homeschooling for eight years and have always received the best advice and encouragement from other homeschoolers, rather than a book or lecture.","My desire, my passion, was to help moms with practical encouragement.","They sent me to these places to get the weight off. The diets never worked; the diets actually made it worse.","When I did start writing books, I didn't realize it, but the girls that grew up watching the show became moms."],"LisaRaye McCoy-Misick":["I'm a talkative person because I like to get to know a person and I like you to get to know me.","I've tried everything but celibacy, and I really want to know what it feels like to be touched by someone with a mental touch and not a physical touch.","I learned from my mistakes; I was able to accept the things that were my fault and to be able to grow from that. You have to be able to see growth from your experiences, and I've done that.","I'm one of those women who's not to be messed with. I'm very opinionated and boisterous at times. I'm also kind and humble. I know when to fold and when to hold, and that's important. If my edge scares you, then you have a choice to remove yourself.","When I was younger, I thought LisaRaye sounded so country, but I've come to really appreciate my family-given name. I was named after my father, David Ray McCoy, and I'm totally a daddy's girl.","I've got to be able to get my time off whether it's just enjoying my house or the peace and quiet of my family and being there and cooking for them. I love doing that. I also love doing leisure things. I ride horses. I love to shop. I love to drive!","As an actress, I have put myself out there as an independent black woman, a single mom, a go-getter, a hustler who isn't afraid to survive.","I have very few friends. I'm an associate of everybody and friend of none.","Some men are afraid of women who challenge them and demand respect and answers. That's who I am and will always be.","I grew up on the Southside of Chicago. What people don't realize is that my father was a multimillionaire who owned 12 hotels, motels, a steel mill, a radio station, a club, nursing home, and a law office. So I think it's safe to say I'm a little above middle class and I'm a daddy's girl.","I make no apologies for loving the finer things in life or the men I choose to date. I don't feel bad about the person I am. Now, I do have an edge, rawness and realness, and I can tell you I'm going to keep that.","Growing up, I stayed in a child's place. My father was murdered when I was 20. I was a model and never had a real job and my parents took care of me.","I want to start dating the man that I'm gonna marry. I want to start having some fun with someone that I know I'm gonna be with. I don't play any games. I'm too old for that. I've been there; I've been around the block.","I want to know what it is to build the foundation of the friendship for real, to have my best friend and not because we're just intimate, but because we're mentally intimate. So I'm waiting for that person to come into my life.","I know how to play comedy when it's needed. So even when it's really not there, my facial expressions are really great. I have a lot of facial expressions in my face, you know.","I intimidate a lot of men, because I've done a lot. I'm established. I'm successful.","I'm not into younger men. A couple of years younger, maybe, but I'm not a cougar. I'm not a panther, either.","I've got girlfriends who call me 'Raye' or 'L. Raye', but when somebody calls me 'Lisa', it's like, 'You've got two more times to say that and then I think you're disrespecting me and I'm going to have to cut you!'","It is much easier to fight through this thing called life with someone, as opposed to fighting alone. I absolutely want to be a wife and to come home to somebody who I know adores me.","I think it is important for every actress to be able to feel whatever garment she has on because, we as women, we know when we look good. We know when we feel good.","Acting is wonderful, but it's not pulling in the type of money that I want. It's not bringing in the type of money that I am used to or the type of money that is going to supply my lifestyle. I'm a leisure girl; I like to be over in Italy or in Europe, you know shopping or vacationing, you know.","I am such a vacation girl. I have little places that I go to frequently! If I am not too busy on a weekend, I try to go someplace like Mexico or Manzanillo or something like that."],"Lisanne Falk":["There are so many beautiful girls who aren't photogenic. In real life, half the models you see look really hideous.","Sure there is a sexy attitude, and when they say, 'Give me a sexy look with your eyes,' you give it to them. It doesn't have to relate to the product. People are just drawn to it.","I really love modeling a lot. Once I am behind the camera and start moving, there's a kind of energy that makes me feel good. But I know I have to prepare for something else before I grow up.","I live in a cottage and volunteer in the village shop."],"Lisel Mueller":["Everything is autobiography, even if one writes something that is totally objective. The fact that it's a subject that seizes you makes it autobiographical.","I am imprinted with the whole sense of European history, especially German history, going back to World War I, which really destroyed all the old values and culture. My grandparents had been reasonably well-off but they became quite poor, living in an attic apartment.","Poetry, for me, is the answer to, 'How does one stay sane when private lives are being ransacked by public events?' It's something that hangs over your head all the time.","When I was in college, I did do some writing of poetry, somewhat inspired, I think at that time, by Carl Sandburg, because English was still relatively new to me, and Sandburg, of course, wrote in a very easy-to-understand, very colloquial and informal manner.","Memory and poetry go together, absolutely. It is a matter of preserving and of remembering things.","Well, language seems to be something that obsesses me. I'm always writing about it."],"Lisi Harrison":["I completely remember the horror I felt when my pits started getting hairy. I would walk with my arms pressed against my sides.","I like writing about the issues we all bump up against as we get older, but I try to present them in a fun way.","My goal is to teach readers how to treat and respect themselves and each other in an entertaining way. I do that in all of my books.","I was a terrible athlete and a pretty bad student. I couldn't focus. My imagination was always racing.","I don't like the vampire books. I don't like any of those."],"Lita Ford":["Stiletto, I look at it more as an attitude as opposed to a high-heeled shoe.","I like to travel. I love touring, I love playing.","But duets are a lot of fun, I'd love to do another one.","We don't have a lot of neighbors so we can blast the stereo.","It's better for me to play with guys because Rock 'n' Roll has such an aggressive attitude.","I'm happy when I'm doing what I do best.","I was eleven and I wanted to play it because it was in my blood. It was a feeling I couldn't deny.","I worked at the cosmetic counter at a fine department store.","I loved Herman's Head. And it was a great experience.","Joe Walsh is a great guy and and an unbelievable talent, I'd like to work with him again someday.","I don't smoke, so they never sent me a copy.","But when I record my next studio album, of course I'll do the lead vocals.","I didn't tour Europe, because I didn't have any label support.","You can never learn it all and I hope to continue my growth as a person and a musician.","I've got a great place, it's a country house.","We've got horse property and there's other stuff to do. Like, four wheel driving, we barbeque, drink beers, sit around and play guitars and have a merry 'ol time.","I'm not much of a club goer because every time I do go I get in trouble.","I have no skanky guys in my band nor on my bus. If they are they get the boot real quick.","I did play every little note on the guitar on that record.","I have a lot of female fans.","It's nice when they say I inspire them, it inspires me.","I think it gets boring (for the audience) for the lead singer to have a guitar hanging on them all the time.","You're stuck in front of the microphone. You can't use your hands. I like to do things.","Don't get me wrong, I've seen some very excellent women musicians.","I need that aggressive attitude to play my music and more men have that attitude than women.","Life has become serious for me, although I do like to party every now and then."],"Little Louie Vega":["House music is the root of all electronic dance music.","House music is like going to church - it touches you. There's something really magical about it that pulls you in, and you just want to keep learning more about it.","I collect many hats, but I do like Bailey's Hats, and I order them online.","Dance music has evolved very much. From DJs playing at the Olympics, to playing at the Super Bowl, working with Cirque Du Soleil and even getting recognized at the Grammys with awards, dance music is growing in a big way.","Dance music always goes through its changes; many styles come have their light and go back to the underground 'til it happens again.","I always think about making a CD you can hear in your car, your house party, with wonderful energy for all.","When I'm not working, I'm having fun with my son. We do lots of kids' stuff.","At a time when club music has gone more electronic, I've gone the other way: organic and world music.","For me, family has always been one of the key reasons to make music.","My abiding childhood memory is watching my uncle perform to thousands in Madison Square Garden. He wore a white suit and came down from the ceiling on a rope, and the crowd went crazy.","At rehearsals, I began conducting the band, counting them in without thinking. I guess it came from watching salsa legends like my uncle and Tito Puente, who was very much the leader of his band on stage.","I'm definitely looking forward to DJing in Scotland again. There's always fun and a great party vibe.","I want to record many albums, have a healthy record label with talented artists, keep building my publishing catalogue, and maintain our culture with good music that will be remembered for years to come.","Dance is merging with the more mainstream hip hop/R&B scene, and there will be new ideas and sounds.","Look at Daft Punk and Kanye West. The song 'Stronger' was inspired by a Daft tune. Once the hip-hop scene opens up to all the great music that came out of dance, it will continue to spread to the more mainstream audience.","'Nuyorican Soul' has a lot to do with our lives, growing up in New York, listening to all different styles of music, hanging out with all different kinds of people.","The good thing about 'Nuyorican Soul' is we get a little bit of everybody liking it.","George Benson conquered many different genres, from pop ballads to R&B to jazz.","We'd take records you'd never hear in clubs and make them into club tracks. We were doing B-sides on records that had nothing to do with the songs, and calling them Masters at Work dubs.","Every time we play our music in clubs, there's such a strong reaction.","'Dance' got on WBLS and over 25 urban AC stations. I never had a record on urban AC and gospel stations before.","People are digging into house music even from other genres.","I think it's healthy to have a lot of different styles within a genre. It makes it much more interesting.","To me, there's a lot more bottom and 'dirt' with vinyl. When I say dirt, it's good dirt. You need that raw sound in the clubs. To me, a CD is too clean.","I always want to make my records sound great so they'll stand the test of time, and that takes a lot of work.","I get inspiration from all kinds of things: I can get it from hanging out with my son, from hanging out with my wife, from checking out different artists, from hearing something at a party.","I love deejaying, of course; that's where my heart and my passion is."],"Little Milton":["And I tell my audience, you know, give the real stars a round of applause. Because without them I'm nobody. So I learned so much from people like that.","And one of my favorites was Eddy Arnold of course. He just had that smooth, soulful voice.","I did learn that it was the greatest thing in the world to respect yourself. Respect other people.","I was born in a little place called Inverness, MS.","I was never into the Bluegrass, Bill Monroe and stuff like that.","I'm from the Mississippi delta originally.","Most times we would make more money in the tip boxes - they called it - than we were getting paid.","My mom moved up between Leland and Greenville when I was just a little tot.","So I got a chance to meet a whole bunch of those old real, real rough but gentle men. They lived hard, but they lived good - in one sense, you know. But you had a lot of fun. Didn't make much money, but you had a lot of fun.","We could play them through the week, and then the weekend we could play the black joints. I learned to be very versatile and learned to love it. So it stays with me even up to now."],"Little Richard":["I think God made a woman to be strong and not to be trampled under the feet of men. I've always felt this way because my mother was a very strong woman, without a husband.","I'm very much a gentleman in what I do.","I look back on my life, comin' out of Macon, Georgia - I never thought I'd be a superstar, a living legend. I never heard of no rock and roll in my life.","I try to be a guide for people, to make their darkness bright and to make the pathway light, and never to condemn or control or criticize.","But men are so full of greed today, they'll sell anything for a little piece of money.","God is omnipotent, He is omniscient, and He is ever present.","Elvis may be the King of Rock and Roll, but I am the Queen.","And I'd like to give my love to everybody, and let them know that the grass may look greener on the other side, but believe me, it's just as hard to cut.","It was a way out of poverty. It was a way to success. It was a way to education. And it was a way to a brighter day for me.","Black people lived right by the railroad tracks, and the train would shake their houses at night. I would hear it as a boy, and I thought: I'm gonna make a song that sounds like that.","I would wear flamboyant clothes and long hair, and most singers at the time didn't.","I think people who don't believe in God are crazy. How can you say there is no God when you hear the birds singing these beautiful songs you didn't make?","Gay people are the sweetest, kindest, most artistic, warmest and most thoughtful people in the world. And since the beginning of time all they've ever been is kicked.","I never accepted the idea that I had to be guided by some pattern or blueprint.","Plus I love Tanya Tucker and I love country music.","People called rock & roll 'African music.' They called it 'voodoo music.' They said that it would drive the kids insane. They said that it was just a flash in the pan - the same thing that they always used to say about hip-hop.","I am the architect of rock n' roll. I have to be a fan of all its forms.","God gives us the ability, but rock 'n' roll was created by men.","I think they saw me as something like a deliverer, a way out. My means of expression, my music, was a way in which a lot of people wished they could express themselves and couldn't.","I did what I felt, and I felt what I did, at all costs.","And I don't get down on nobody else for doing whatever else they do. To each his own.","And I think a woman should find it a joy to be female because God made both male and female.","But I was singing loud, and most singers weren't singing loud.","But I'm a rock 'n' roll singer; that's my livelihood, my occupation.","But when I went on the stage to do a show, I would put on makeup because I felt that it enhanced my act; it drew attention to what I was doing.","Greed has taken the whole universe, and nobody is worried about their soul.","I also like the banging piano - that old good-time piano.","I also think that what's wrong with all of us is that we don't show enough love toward each other.","I always knew I was a man, always felt that I was a man, always wanted to be a man.","I don't give the devil credit for creating nothing.","I don't think a woman has to act like a man to show that she has strength.","I don't think that you have to be effeminate to be sensitive.","I just want the world to know that God is present, that he's alive for ever more.","I let people know that it was all right to do the kinds of things I did.","I love God, and I'm a follower.","I never heard nobody in my audience call me any kind of names.","I only wore makeup when I went onstage.","I thank God for making me a man.","I think that a man should be caring.","I tried to look presentable for a show, but not for sexual attraction. It was strictly for show business.","I was always my own person.","I was really kind of shy as a child. But I would do things for attention.","I'm here to sing.","I've never seen the devil create music.","If I had my life to live over, I would want to be a man.","Like, my mother would have company over, and I would sing so they'd pay attention to me.","No, I've never truly been a minister.","Now they have banging guitar and no bass and call it rock, but that's not what I call rock.","Rock 'n' roll offered me a platform to speak what I felt. It also offered me a platform to support my mama and my brothers and sisters - twelve children.","Some situations you cause yourself.","To me, true rock 'n' roll has a lot of bottom in it.","When you sit down and think about what rock 'n' roll music really is, then you have to change that question. Played up-tempo, you call it rock 'n' roll; at a regular tempo, you call it rhythm and blues.","My mother died, and I couldn't stand to look at her bedroom any more. I'd get sick. I've always been a momma's boy.","It's hard to have a friend when your name's a household word.","I think my legacy should be that when I started in show business, there wasn't no such thing as rock n' roll. When I started with 'Tutti Frutti,' that's when rock really started rocking.","A lot of people call me the architect of rock & roll. I don't call myself that, but I believe it's true.","I've never gotten money from most of those records. And I made those records: In the studio, they'd just give me a bunch of words, I'd make up a song! The rhythm and everything. 'Good Golly Miss Molly'! And I didn't get a dime for it.","I'm a conductor of revivals. The only minister in the whole package. Little Richard, the evangelist."],"Little Simz":["I realised that you have to be honest. When you're being open, that's when people connect with you. You just have to be yourself.","I've always loved the English language. I just like words, you know?","I'm just a bit of a dreamer, and I get really in my thoughts. I get so deep with myself at times it's almost very scary.","Music is like therapy, you know? It's my escape. It's my way for me to express my feelings and my thoughts.","Taking on different characters and seeing things through the eyes of different people is interesting to me. When I look at what people are going through in life, I try to understand their story.","Singles are for people that want to chart - I'm measuring my success by how well I connect with people.","The whole point of an album is to understand the artist and enjoy the music - it's supposed to make you want to go to a concert to see them in the flesh and get the album on vinyl and be a part of everything. That's what I'm about.","I haven't knocked all the doors I need to knock down, but I can see it happening more and more. It will just take more perseverance and work.","The very first song I ever wrote was called 'I See Between The Trees,' when I was 9. It was really bad.","I've worked really, really hard on my lyricism.","I'm an artist. I'm a musician. I'm not someone you can put in a box.","I've always been the kid who's known what they wanted to do.","My mom raised me to be a strong person.","I don't dress to impress; I've never been that person.","I'm not an 'out there' person if it's not on stage or if I'm not around people I'm most comfortable with.","I struggled with working with producers because no one openly wanted to give me a chance to rap on their beats. That's just honest talk. No one really wanted to take that risk.","Just because I'm British and I represent London to the core, that doesn't necessarily mean I have to stay there.","I chose to continue independent because, at the time I was being offered deals, it wasn't fitting into what I'd imagined. I decided to take a gamble on myself and see what happens.","I've experienced racism and run-ins with the law, and it's a real thing, and it happens where I grew up. It's something that not a lot of people want to talk about. I feel like I have a duty, and I wouldn't be honest or true to myself if I didn't speak about it.","In real life, I'm not the center of attention; I'm in the back, and I listen. So when it comes to writing, I just let it all out.","My sisters and my mum taught me how to be a woman: the way they carry themselves, the way they talk to people, the way they know how to put their foot down. They're not having any nonsense from no one. I can see traces of that in me.","I believe in equality: guys have rights, women have rights. It should be the same with race, or class, or whatever. I just like balance.","I'll leave my house if I need to. Otherwise I'm super comfortable in my own space, in my own company.","Sometimes I look at music as like movies. And so I feel like you can have your comedies, and you can have your dramas, and you can have your romances or whatever.","I like it when people have good flow, but I also like it when people actually say stuff. Because sometimes that's a very good distraction, like, to have impeccable flow, but you're saying a lot without saying anything.","I just wanted to kind of break down those gender stereotypes and just say everyone's equal, everyone's their own person, everyone's their own individual.","I was always just an ambitious kid from early. I always knew that I had a purpose and I was destined for something big, great.","When I write, I normally write anywhere that I can feel at peace, so if it's in my bedroom, if it's at the park, if it's by a lake somewhere, wherever I feel calm is where I like to write.","I like to refer to myself as king sometimes, not as queen. That's a conscious decision, because I feel like women are just equally as powerful.","I'm a rapper and, obviously, hip hop rap is my main thing. But I also like to dive into different genres and kind of be a bit more experimental and open myself up a bit, whether that's taking influence from jazz or soul or electronic.","I just always want to be as transparent as possible.","I want to be ambassador-like. I want to, you know, set examples, especially as a young black female. That, I think, is important, and I just want to be a bit of an example, you know.","I'm not desperate to sign, like, a record deal. I'm very hungry, but I'm just not desperate for it.","I did a show in Germany, and some kid - he was disabled - he was actually in a wheelchair, and he came out to my show, and he couldn't get across to me what he was trying to say, and you could see that he was frustrated because he couldn't fully express himself, and I just felt like, 'Wow, he's just really passionate about me.'","I just write about how I'm feeling at the time. If I feel like being cheeky and a bit straight up and a bit aggressive, you'll hear that in my music. If I feel like being very vulnerable and opening up about something personal, you'll hear that, too.","I have a good family. I have good friends. I have people that actually care about my wellbeing as opposed to just work and just need me for work or whatever. Like, people that genuinely look out for me and my health, knowing how much work I put in.","I don't get fazed by things easily. I don't really care about much; I'm just not interested in a lot. I'm just interested in the well being of my close ones, my music, the message I'm portraying, how my efforts are contributing to society.","I'm aware that as much as people like hearing and listening to my music, it's also very therapeutic for me to be able to express myself some way - how I'm feeling, how I'm thinking, and just saying what's in my heart and on my mind. I need to do that to maintain my sanity.","I'm not easily satisfied with things. I always want to do better. I always want to improve. I always want to grow.","I'm the youngest of four. I have two older sisters and an older brother and was raised by a single mother. Basically, my household was just full of life. Everything was lit all the time.","I never knew listening to a song could give you goose bumps and make you cry until I listened to Lauryn Hill.","I get 'female Kendrick' quite a lot. I'm definitely not complaining. At the same time, I want to be the female Simz. I just want to be me.","Dance was something I'd just done at my youth club, and I used to teach dance when I was 14 to 19, 20 years old. I had my own dance group, and then I got more into the acting stuff, and I started doing things for TV. And then I put that on pause, because I really wanted to focus on my real passion, which is music.","I change my mind quite a lot about things, which isn't always a good thing.","I could probably say one thing that I'm excited about is I definitely wanna be an entrepreneur and be a humanitarian and that stuff.","I'm not a person who opens up to people, and I feel like music is my way of doing that.","As cliched as it sounds, music is my only form of expression. So I have to be honest with myself, and with that comes being vulnerable.","When you feel like a musician you listen to is like you, then they don't feel so far away, and whatever you want to get to isn't so far away.","I enjoy albums, not a song here and there. The recordings I like have been a soundtrack to a universe."],"Liu Bolin":["I chose to camouflage my body into the environment because this way, people will pay more attention to the background's social property, and the meaning of my body disappeared in this environment as an individual.","In one aspect, my works record the history of the development of Chinese society. Concern about the situation of Chinese reality is one important theme of my works. I am trying to ask, 'How does our society develop? What are the problems in our society? Where is our direction leading?'","Each one chooses his or her path to come in contact with the external world. I chose to merge with the environment.","When my body is covered and disappears, it's not about the relationship between me and the wall, but the relationship between me as an individual and those slogans which are used to fool the public.","Some people would ask: 'You are not the one who does the painting, or shot the work, how can it be your work?' But I was the one who chose which site we should use, and which assistant helps me to do the painting, or the shot."],"Liu Wen":["Since my dimples only appear whenever I smile, facing everything in life with that smile is a wonderful feeling. Eyes are also the window to one's self. Just a look can reflect your identity and experiences.","A fun pair of earrings is basically the finishing touch to any outfit; a nice watch is both practical and decorative, while the perfect unique bag is not only eye-catching but also timeless - it can be passed on to future generations.","People probably think I'm cute because I have dimples and am friendly and always smiling. But beauty is different. In Chinese, people say I have chi ze, which means aura or a strong sense of presentation. It's not about my look.","Persistence is a secret weapon for everyone.","When my inner mood is positive, I also feel great on the outside.","My favourite city is Miami. It's very fresh and the beach is sunny.","My hometown is a very boring city. There isn't a lot of industry - there are a lot of trees. It's not like Beijing where the sky is always dark. In my city the sky is blue and the sun shines.","You'll encounter difficulties at any job, and the best way for me to get through them is via endurance.","In my school days, everyone thought I'm too tall for a Chinese girl.","I just wear very nice pyjamas. When I'm at home, I love to watch movies and relax because when I'm modeling, I'm always travelling. When I'm not working I don't put much make up, but I do love nail polish for that little bit of fun colour.","Fashion and style are a language - they helps us communicate with each other in a creative way. Style is one of the most important methods of self-expression.","Every makeup artist or stylist with whom I work has many special ideas, tips, and creations. I can always learn so much from them.","Before I modeled, I never thought I was beautiful. Even right now, I don't think I'm beautiful. I think it's my personality that makes my beauty different and unique. If you look in the past, Chinese people have always considered things like big eyes, pointy nose, or big lips beautiful. I had the same thoughts as a child watching movies.","I hope that when people see Asian women, they realize we are all different. A lot of time with Caucasian people, they just group us together as Asian. But even with different cities in China, people have different personalities... We look Asian, but we still look different. We don't look the same.","Love your job, stay punctual, and appreciate everything!","You can mix and match, depending on your own mood, whether you want your look of the day to be casual, cool, or even punk.","Being in this position enables myself and others to deliver messages of positivity - we can broadcast to everyone just how beautiful this world is, and all the ways we can keep it beautiful by treating one another with kindness.","I was studying tourism at college and wanted to travel the world as a tour guide - that was my dream! But actually, sometimes modeling feels quite similar, because I travel so much - probably even more than tour guiding.","Fashion is a good job for a young girl. I like clothes - I like to play with clothes. I like DIY; I like to make outfit.","The first time at Louis Vuitton was Spring 2009 season, and I remember that the colors of the clothes were very dreamy.","I'm not that big a celebrity. I'm just an ordinary person.","Your look changes depending on your confidence, and then your beauty changes. When I first came to New York, all the people were saying, 'You look so Asian because you have a different eye shape.' They didn't really understand because they didn't really see that many Asian models.","Fashion is constantly evolving throughout the seasons and within various cultural changes, but the one thing that has stayed constant is how I always want my style to be an authentic, intrinsic part of myself.","I've become more and more comfortable with occasionally dressing sexier, but I still hope to express a 'cool' type of sensuality.","Now, there are more and more Asian models and opportunities to understand Asian beauty.","Fall in love with the work you do - that is the best way to make everything last.","I have lots of vintage clothes.","I used to see Estee Lauder's ads everywhere in the subways of Beijing, and I thought how wonderful it would be if the model on them was myself!","My parents are very humble people who have simple lives... they live in a pleasant little town in China.","No one else in my family works in the fashion industry.","Striped shirts and printed shorts, jeans, and trousers are all items I buy and wear a lot in my private life.","I collect a lot of eco-friendly shopping bags that serve to separate my shoes other and other small stuff in my luggage.","Romantic music really stirs my soul. And, of course, I love Chinese music; it makes me feel closer to home.","When I'm studying English I love to watch 'Friends' or 'Nikita.'","I don't use any makeup if I'm not doing work.","I never wore high heels in my hometown.","When I was little, I never wanted to be a model or really thought of doing this job. I'm from a small city, Yongzhou Hunan in the south of China - not a big place for fashion.","I've learned what looks too sexy or too tomboy or too cool for me! I know what suits me now.","For my beauty routine, it's kind of complicated. It's not easy at all. I like being natural, but natural is not really natural. To be natural, you need to have really good skin. This is really important.","I have a strong appreciation for oversize sweatshirts, loose mohair sweaters, and jeans that are frayed at the ankles.","When I was 17, I entered a modeling contest in my home province in China because my mother wanted me to learn better posture. And the rest is history!","I feel the most beautiful when I'm the most relaxed - for example, after a productive day of work or during a comfortable, rested afternoon. But I also feel great when I reunite with friends after a long time."],"Liu Xiang":["Challenges are meant to be met and overcome.","Things are better now that the attention has subsided a bit, and I'm happier. Now I can concentrate on what I'm supposed to do, that is, training and running. Despite everything that's happened, I feel like I'm still the same person.","Of course, rivals do affect athletes mentally, but if you are competing with top-notch athletes, you will push each other, you will encourage each other.","What I want is that I can match my performances during training so I can be satisfied with myself.","Collin Jackson was a little before my time and he was a really good athlete. I've raced with him, but he's now retired. He's a really good role model and someone that I've learnt a lot from.","When I was younger, I used to be a high jumper before I switched to hurdles."],"Liu Xiaobo":["Hatred is corrosive of a person's wisdom and conscience; the mentality of enmity can poison a nation's spirit, instigate brutal life and death struggles, destroy a society's tolerance and humanity, and block a nation's progress to freedom and democracy.","Free expression is the base of human rights, the root of human nature and the mother of truth. To kill free speech is to insult human rights, to stifle human nature and to suppress truth.","If you want to enter hell, don't complain of the dark; you can't blame the world for being unfair if you start on the path of the rebel.","Ultimately, change will happen when problems persist and enough people are concerned.","There is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom, and China will, in the end, become a nation ruled by law, where human rights reign supreme.","The free world led by the U.S. fought almost all regimes that trampled on human rights.","My dear, with your love I can calmly face my impending trial, having no regrets about the choices I've made and optimistically awaiting tomorrow.","China, as a major nation of the world, as one of five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and as a member of the U.N. Council on Human Rights, should be contributing to peace for humankind and progress toward human rights.","In order to exercise the right to freedom of speech conferred by the Constitution, one should fulfill the social responsibility of a Chinese citizen.","I do my best to make every word from my pen a cry from the heart for the souls of the dead.","I have been obsequious toward Western civilization, exaggerating its merits and, at the same time, exaggerating my own merits.","In my view, Reform and Opening Up began with the abandonment of the 'using class struggle as guiding principle' government policy of the Mao era and, in its place, a commitment to economic development and social harmony.","Appreciation has become my destiny in life. Perhaps it's the instinct of a polar bear enjoying hibernation in the vast snows.","It took Hong Kong 100 years to become what it is.","I hope that I will be the last victim in China's long record of treating words as crimes.","My praise is perhaps an unforgivable poison.","The major wars that the U.S. became involved in are all ethically defensible.","The Internet is truly God's gift to the Chinese people.","Love as intense as ice, love as remote as blackness.","If there has been any progress in the Chinese society and politics over the last 20 years, it is all because the citizens have been pushing for change.","I have no enemies and no hatred. None of the police who monitored, arrested, and interrogated me, none of the prosecutors who indicted me, and none of the judges who judged me are my enemies.","My searing desire to atone for having survived helps me resist the temptations to join the world of lies.","My tendency to idealize Western civilization arises from my nationalistic desire to use the West in order to reform China. But this has led me to overlook the flaws of Western culture.","I have viewed the West as if it were not only the salvation of China but also the natural and ultimate destination of all humanity.","In China the underworld and officialdom have interpenetrated and become one. Criminal elements have become officialized as officials have become criminalized.","For those of us in the opposition movement under dictatorships, part of our job is confronting police and spending time in prison. So, a dissident not only needs to learn how to oppose oppression but also how to face the crackdowns and time in prison.","Our political system continues to produce human rights disasters and social crises, thereby not only constricting China's own development but also limiting the progress of all of human civilization.","I always think that reforms and turning China into a free country is a long and tortuous process. Despite this, in a totalitarian state, the fight for freedom comes from the accumulative efforts of the people; without such efforts, very little will happen.","From B.A. to M.A. and on to Ph.D., my academic career was all smooth sailing. Upon receiving my degrees, I stayed on to teach at Beijing Normal University.","In the course of my life, for more than half a century, June 1989 was the major turning point. Up to that point, I was a member of the first class to enter university when college entrance examinations were reinstated following the Cultural Revolution (Class of '77)."],"Liu Yang":["As a female pilot, the sacred rose garden in my heart is the motherland's blue sky.","Baby eagles can never soar under their family's wing.","I am grateful to the motherland and the people. I feel honored to fly into space on behalf of hundreds of millions of female Chinese citizens.","I believe in persevering. If you persevere, success lies ahead of you.","From day one, I have been told I am no different from the male astronauts. As a pilot, I flew in the sky. Now that I am an astronaut, I will fly in space.","Thank you for the confidence put in my by the motherland and the people, for giving me this chance to represent China's millions of women by going into space.","We won't let you down. We will work together and successfully complete this mission.","Tiangong 1, our home in space, was comfortable and pleasant.","Performing tai chi in space - it is comfortable; we got more outer space chi."],"Liv Bruce":["I care more about a 15-year-old queer kid in Iowa who wants to know that there's anything out there that resembles their experience and life than the hip queer person in Brooklyn.","I do think that for a queer person to speak truthfully without shame about their own experiences is political.","I think this is the funny thing about PWR BTTM that a lot of people don't realize at first, which is that straight people have always loved us - inexplicably, seemingly.","The snappy way I would sum it up is not everyone is queer, but everyone has felt different. And I think that is something that people can really relate to in our music.","I used to listen to so many song bands that were all straight people, and my thinking on it was, 'Well, if I can kind of suspend my own perception of myself and listen to Rivers Cuomo singing about girls, then I don't see why a straight guy can't listen to a band called PWR BTTM.'","I want to make sure that I can stand behind every word I'm saying, because whoever I am in six months is going to have to be accountable.","I've been spending a lot of time poring over everything I've written, because I know people are going to hear it.","Music can be new to you but not new right now. It can be really fun to ask people of different generations what they used to go see.","There are a lot of bands that my parents used to go see that I haven't necessarily heard of, and asking them to dig up stuff like that is a really fun way to discover music.","There's something really special to me about sharing mutual admiration with another musician.","My friend and I were talking about the band Limp Wrist, and how cool that name is, so we started bouncing other queer-punk band names off each other. The first one I thought of was The Power Bottoms, which I later shortened to Power Bottom.","If they're booking a PWR BTTM show, they know what they're in for.","In the studio, we sometimes will add bass or some other stuff, like more layers of the same guitar part that's already there, but ultimately, the sound is about guitar and drums.","Only having one melody instrument in play at a time meant that we could improvise more in our practices.","As for the drag thing, we each do it in different ways and for different reasons. For me, it's kinda about expressing a side of myself that's always in there but usually doesn't come out. Mostly because I'm too lazy to look that good every day.","I first went to 'Rocky Horror' when I was 14, and nothing was the same after that. For about two months afterwards, I would watch that movie in my bed every night.","I usually put on a lip and some mascara before I head out of the house. It makes me feel good. I started experimenting with makeup back in high school. One of my friends, who shall remain nameless, shoplifted a bunch of drugstore cosmetics for me, and I would just play with it in my room at night.","I'm typically attracted to men or male-identified people 99% of the time. But I guess if I had to pick a label for it, I don't know know... 'Gay' doesn't really work anymore because it means when a man loves a man, and I don't feel like a man. That doesn't super work for me anymore.","Sometimes I feel like both; sometimes I feel like neither. Sometimes I feel like something else completely. Gender-wise, I identify as a non-binary person, which means not male, not female.","In a way, a stage can be the safest place to be visibly queer and non-gender conforming because you're literally surrounded by witnesses. Any type of violence that a person might try to carry out on you, that's just not a very likely place to do it.","My way of connecting to the community that I imagined was out there somewhere for me, but wasn't there right now was to download tons and tons of discographies of famed divas. So I had Christina Aguilera's discography, Whitney Houston's discography, Mariah Carey's discography, all of that.","Growing up, I was listening to Scissor Sisters.","We ultimately use good art as a tool for people to contextualize themselves, and the folks in all the places we play experience it how they will. All we're doing is saying what we think. I never really wanted to be anyone's hero.","I have many queer friends who I consider to be heroes of mine, and they feel the same way toward me.","So many famous iconic American songs are protest songs, and I think that the vast majority of artists will only continue to add to that body of work.","I'm always excited to create space for people to relate to one another.","People, despite having the common interest in our band, might not be friends before meeting at a show. It's great bringing families together.","To a young person who can't come out to our show, make your own band. Make your own music project.","Thinking of Internet chat rooms or AIM as a kind - there's such an intimacy and honesty to tapping on your phone, despite how quick people are to damn digital means of communication as emotionless or too abstract.","There have been a lot of times in my life where I came out to a perfect stranger by some chance encounter. It's way easier than coming out to your family. I started high school 'out,' then I had to tell my family. I had to introduce myself to the family.","'Carbs' is the first song I wrote, and 'I Wanna Boi' is the second song I wrote. I am very proud of every song I made since then. Anything I'm not proud of I wouldn't show people."],"Liv Tyler":["Oh, my God, this amazing cool breeze is coming through my window and the sun is shining. I'm happy.","Solitude has its own very strange beauty to it.","The age I'm at now, you go from being a young girl to suddenly you blossom into a woman. You ripen, you know? And then you start to rot.","There is no definition of beauty, but when you can see someone's spirit coming through, something unexplainable, that's beautiful to me.","Life excites me-just little, normal, everyday things. Getting out of bed. Getting dressed. Making food. I find it all exciting.","I don't think I'm particularly beautiful at all.","I love my dad, although I'm definitely critical of him sometimes, like when his pants are too tight. But I love him so much and I try to be really supportive of him.","I have been working since I was 14, nonstop.","I cried on my 18th birthday. I thought 17 was such a nice age. You're young enough to get away with things, but you're old enough, too.","I am scared of becoming a mother.","Sure, my childhood was unusual. All these eccentric, wild people frequented our home: rock stars, drag queens, models, bikers, freaks. But I was not this little rich girl. My mom and I lived in an apartment.","I've sung my whole life. I've taken lots of voice lessons and I love to sing. But I've never really sung professionally at all.","Casey Affleck is a really good friend of mine. I know Casey a lot better than I know Ben, even though Ben and I have worked together a lot.","I think it's healthy for couples to be away from each other for short periods.","I've been spending this last month trying to find four outfits to wear to the different premieres of The Two Towers. It's hard work.","I love observing people.","I don't think a lot of really good films get seen.","Working with Bernardo Bertolucci was one of the greatest highlights of my whole life. It was such an incredible opportunity for me.","I'm not perfect at all.","When I was pregnant. I exercised and was healthy, but it was also the first time since I was 14 that I wasn't on a diet.","All my boys make me laugh.","I love to go shopping at Target. They have so much stuff there, you can buy almost anything, it's really amazing."],"Liv Ullmann":["Hollywood is loneliness beside the swimming pool.","If only we could accept that there is no difference between us where human values are concerned. Whatever sex.","Ibsen was Norwegian by birth, but universal in spirit.","We all need somebody to talk to. It would be good if we talked... not just pitter-patter, but real talk. We shouldn't be so afraid, because most people really like this contact; that you show you are vulnerable makes them free to be vulnerable.","The older one gets in this profession, the more people there are with whom one would never work again.","Sometimes I get a little tired of it. But you know, what a privilege, to get tired of working with Ingmar Bergman.","The best thing that can come with success is the knowledge that it is nothing to long for."],"Liv Warfield":["I knew I could sing when I was about 7 years old. But since athletics was very much the forefront of my life, and I was kind of doing that a lot, I don't think anybody was caring or looking for me to be singing anything. So, yeah, I just kept it hidden from everyone.","I think there's a, you know, certain kind of freedom for me when I get on stage. Maybe it's because I've held it back for so long that it's made me a little bit of angst inside. It's kind of like this energy needs to come out. And there's a certain sense, you know, of freedom when I get on that stage.","I really think I've found me finally in the music. You know, I had put an album out before, 'Embrace Me,' and it's been seven years since that. So I was discovering who I was. And I still am discovering, but I think now I know a little bit more of who I am. So that's what's pushing me.","Working with Prince, it's kind of like he's opened up this whole new world, especially with the horn players. And I'm like, 'Man, only if I had strings on this album, too.' And I'm like, 'I wish I had an orchestra.' So I just, you know - I just wonder what's next, you know. I just want to constantly push myself for more.","Being with Prince and the New Power Generation, I was very influenced by those sounds, and now I'm more than ready to show that side of me with confidence.","When I'm on stage, it's such a spiritual moment that I hope, even when we hit 'Fallon,' you can feel that through the TV. I have this whole horn section that's part of New Power Generation; I have an amazing crew of musicians behind me. It's their energy, too.","Everything is so fast, and everybody wants to be stars and stuff, they're taking the music out of the schools and kids wanting to play instruments, that whole piece of it is gone. Nobody is taking responsibility to push these kids to want to do it. Nobody's reaching their hand out to it, and it's pretty sad."],"Livy":["Rome has grown since its humble beginnings that it is now overwhelmed by its own greatness.","All things will be clear and distinct to the man who does not hurry; haste is blind and improvident.","Many difficulties which nature throws in our way, may be smoothed away by the exercise of intelligence.","We can endure neither our vices nor the remedies for them.","The sun has not yet set for all time.","There are laws for peace as well as war.","Envy like fire always makes for the highest points.","A fraudulent intent, however carefully concealed at the outset, will generally, in the end, betray itself.","The populace is like the sea motionless in itself, but stirred by every wind, even the lightest breeze.","This above all makes history useful and desirable; it unfolds before our eyes a glorious record of exemplary actions.","Woe to the conquered.","Men are only clever at shifting blame from their own shoulders to those of others.","The result showed that fortune helps the brave.","Toil and pleasure, dissimilar in nature, are nevertheless united by a certain natural bond.","He will have true glory who despises it.","No law can possibly meet the convenience of every one: we must be satisfied if it be beneficial on the whole and to the majority.","Temerity is not always successful.","Under the influence of fear, which always leads men to take a pessimistic view of things, they magnified their enemies' resources, and minimized their own.","It is better that a guilty man should not be brought to trial than that he should be acquitted.","In difficult and desperate cases, the boldest counsels are the safest.","Men are slower to recognize blessings than misfortunes.","There is always more spirit in attack than in defence.","Truth, they say, is but too often in difficulties, but is never finally suppressed.","From abundance springs satiety.","Fortune blinds men when she does not wish them to withstand the violence of her onslaughts.","Luck is of little moment to the great general, for it is under the control of his intellect and his judgment.","Nowhere are our calculations more frequently upset than in war.","The old Romans all wished to have a king over them because they had not yet tasted the sweetness of freedom.","It is easier to criticize than to correct our past errors.","It is easy at any moment to surrender a large fortune; to build one up is a difficult and an arduous task.","They are more than men at the outset of their battles; at the end they are less than the women.","Resistance to criminal rashness comes better late than never.","Favor and honor sometimes fall more fitly on those who do not desire them.","There is nothing man will not attempt when great enterprises hold out the promise of great rewards.","There is nothing worse than being ashamed of parsimony or poverty.","There is nothing that is more often clothed in an attractive garb than a false creed.","The troubles which have come upon us always seem more serious than those which are only threatening.","No crime can ever be defended on rational grounds."],"Liya Kebede":["The most inspiring piece of advice I've gotten is simply to persevere. My mom taught me to always keep going no matter what from an early age. When it feels too difficult to push forward, I always remind myself, 'This too shall pass,' and then I redouble my efforts.","One thing modeling taught me is that the spotlight can change everything.","Take good care of your skin and hydrate. If you have good skin, everything else will fall into place.","Investing in women's lives is an investment in sustainable development, in human rights, in future generations - and consequently in our own long-term national interests.","What I love most about Mother's Day is that I am acknowledged and honored for being a mother.","Helping others isn't a chore; it is one of the greatest gifts there is.","It is important for me that I represent a brand that reflects my personality.","The desert loves me. I love the desert. It's nice to be in the heat in Africa. I love it.","We should work to guarantee that there is a midwife or health worker by every woman's side during childbirth.","If nothing else, I want women to understand that they are powerful. If you look back at history, in almost every big moment, in every leap forward, you find ordinary women at the core. We have more ability to make changes in the world than we can imagine if we have the courage to try.","In a hundred years, how do you want the world to be? Everybody should get together to make the world a better place.","It's very difficult to hand someone your whole life story to play, and you've never really met that person.","It's not just Ethiopia, but Africa in general - most of the media concentrates on what's not going well. But there is so much beauty there. When you go, it changes everything. It changes you, your life, and the way you see things. The challenge is changing the image of Africa that's been anchored in people for years now.","Midwives and doctors play a crucial role preventing unnecessary maternal deaths. They educate women about nutrition, health and family planning. And they step in when complications arise.","Doing designs on a loom takes a lot of talent and experience, and, trust me, I won't be able to do that.","There's a saying in Africa: 'To find out you are pregnant is to have one foot in the grave.'","It's always a tricky thing, trying to make aid sustainable.","I've been told the best way to make a sexy face is to say 'pruuune.'","It's one thing to donate money. It's a whole other thing to give an opportunity for someone to make his own money.","When I see Lemlem walking around New York City, it's just mind-boggling, because I know it came from this one man sitting and weaving this little product.","I think, first of all, every time you want to play somebody who is real is always challenging and always scary, because you are given a responsibility of someone's real life.","The world needs our mothers.","I am always touched when friends make contributions to my foundation on my behalf.","I'm a mom. I'm from Ethiopia. I gave birth in the U.S. and had all the proper care available to me. If I had given birth in Ethiopia - I don't know if I might have even survived it.","Traveling around Ethiopia, I saw dozens of abandoned textile factories. People kept asking me to help them find work. So I thought I could make use of my experience in fashion to commercialize their products outside of Ethiopia.","While I was pregnant, I had dozens of checkups. They covered everything from blood tests to ultrasounds, and I even had the option of attending birthing classes with my husband.","Miriam Were has made outstanding contributions to public health in the developing world. She brings basic medical services to women and children in East Africa.","I know how much parents love buying clothes for their kids and how they want to give them something new in the closet.","A small gold plain cross was passed down from my grandma to my mom, then to me, and now to my daughter. It is always nice to own something that connects you to the women who made it possible for you to exist.","I don't think we should judge celebrities for doing charity work. Period. Whatever their reasons for doing it, they are shedding light on issues that would otherwise go unnoticed.","I never thought modeling would become my career. I thought it was something I'd do to pay my way through college.","First I became U.N. Goodwill Ambassador for WHO, and that was in 2005. And then, about a year or so later, I decided to start my foundation.","I actually started modeling in Ethiopia, because that's where I grew up, and I started out by just doing little fashion shows for school, and I liked it so much that I started pursuing it.","Dying in childbirth is something that's not new; it's been going on for ages, and so it's not something that people focus on; it's not something that gets funded a lot, and it's exactly for that reason that we are losing mothers all the time, and we have kids with no mothers.","When a woman has her first child in places like Africa, they're really young. They can be 12, 13,14, so their frames are really small, and they're usually malnourished.","I want to do action, romantic comedy, and I love drama.","I'm Christian. Growing up in Ethiopia, it's half-Christian and half-Muslim. You grow up with Muslim kids. I'm very much aware of their religion.","I grew up watching films. Film has been part of my life since I was a child.","I always loved having the chance to disappear in a story. I always was kind of obsessed with that.","There are things that I will always shoot, but now that the modeling and acting worlds are becoming very close, you can do a little bit of one and more of the other.","I really don't think there should be a movie about me. That's for sure!","I want to spend as much time as possible with my children, so I always like to keep my beauty and fashion routines effortless... but still chic!","For my wardrobe, I like to invest in classic pieces and pair them with more trendy new pieces and accessories each season.","Prenatal care is one of the most effective ways to reduce maternal mortality because it identifies complications or high risks before emergency situations.","I don't listen to people who say my dreams are impossible; I just work to prove them wrong.","No other health disparity is so stark; virtually every woman who dies giving birth lives in a poor country.","We can't end poverty if we fail to save the lives of our world's mothers.","When our mothers are alive and healthy, they do extraordinary things... like the mothers of Plaza de Mayo, who marched in Argentinean plazas, defying the military junta dictatorship and demanding the whereabouts of their abducted children... or the Liberian mothers who faced down civil war armed only with T-shirts and courage.","President Obama has made maternal health one of the core priorities of U.S. international aid funding.","Children with healthy mothers are much more likely to survive childhood, attend school and live healthy, productive lives.","When countries commit to protecting vulnerable lives, they should receive support from those who can provide it in order to make their programs a success.","In 1967, the world health community launched a global effort to eradicate smallpox. It took a coordinated, worldwide effort, required the commitment of every government, and cost $130 million dollars. By 1977, smallpox had disappeared.","Creative new health strategies like micro-insurance for poor people or Kangaroo care for pre-term babies are transforming health outcomes in even the most low-resource settings. Dedication and innovation are transforming health care worldwide.","I can contribute, be valuable, and grow in many ways, since my interests are so varied. That is very satisfying.","For my diet, I choose mostly organic. But in general, I am a big believer in trying to strike a balance with everything.","I tend to gravitate toward Proenza Schouler and Alexander Wang. Their designs are accessible and easy."],"Liz Callaway":["When I talk to young people who want to go to Broadway or whatever, I say, 'The highs are very high and the lows are very low and then there is a lot in between.'","There's just something that is kind of magical that happens when we sing live.","A lot of my albums that I've done, a lot of the songs have been the first take. It's before you mess with it too much - you can take away all the spontaneity and the emotion of something by trying to make it sound perfect.","I love originating shows and originating songs - there is nothing better than being the first one to get to do a song."],"Liz Carpenter":["I have worked all my life, wanted to work all my life, needed to work all my life.","A major advantage of age is learning to accept people without passing judgment.","Anybody against women, against the ERA, should never be voted into office again.","I learned in my four decades in Washington that one person can make a difference.","Instead of looking at life as a narrowing funnel, we can see it ever widening to choose the things we want to do, to take the wisdom we've learned and create something."],"Liz Cheney":["I don't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. If people are in a same-sex relationship, and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary in your life insurance, there's no reason we shouldn't do that.","In Wyoming, the beauty of our mountains is matched only by the grit of our people.","I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage.","I am strongly pro-life, and I am not pro-gay marriage. I believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states and by the people in the states - not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.","We cannot afford to have a president who thinks he's some sort of global community organizer standing over America on one side and our adversaries on the other. America must have a Commander in Chief. Not a global community organizer.","Obama's foreign policy has three parts: Abandon our allies, appease our enemies, and apologize for America.","Wyoming is a special place: Where our farmers and ranchers rise before dawn and work until night to feed our nation. Where our coal miners and oil field workers produce the energy that powers America's homes and businesses, and where our families are guided by faith, know the value of hard work, and deeply love our land.","Oh, I have five kids; I have plenty of abundance.","I think isolationism is a mistake, no matter what party you see it in. We have to remember that there are two threats to our freedom: there's a threat that comes from the federal government, from the Obama Administration policies... but there's also a huge and significant threat from al-Qaeda.","I think there are some instances where U.S. security is threatened by rogue regimes, by foreign dictators, and there are some instances where liberating nations helps to restore our security."],"Liz Goldwyn":["When I think about fashion and elegance, I imagine a woman from the 1950s, on an airplane, with seamed stockings and a garment belt underneath, a skirt, high heels, and her hair that she's done the night before, perfectly done eyeliner, lipstick, gloves, perhaps, and all this just to sit on an airplane for a transcontinental flight.","Red lipstick is my armour - I feel it distracts from my hereditary dark circles and gives me an instant psychological lift, no matter what my mood is.","I mix all different oils - my bathroom at home is littered with oils; I'm really into natural beauty and natural healing. Peppermint is really good if you put it on your stomach for a tummy ache; lavender is kind of all-purpose - I think everyone should carry it.","If fashion has a political significance, it is probably culturally, as a camouflage.","Red lipstick has been my beauty staple for years. I show up to Pilates or yoga at 8 A.M. wearing my red lipstick.","I think people sometimes have a hard time placing me because I don't fit into a box. When they ask what I do at a cocktail party, I either say I'm a Renaissance woman or I'm a high-level madam. Lately I've been more comfortable saying I'm an artist, because that can cover a lot of different things.","I never had a clique. If I throw a party, the only thing connecting people is me. Maybe I just don't believe in fear. I bulldoze right in.","Every winter, I'm a sexy academic deconstructionist. And in the summer, it's normally Brigitte Bardot on holiday in the 1950s.","In general, I'm fascinated by women who exist outside of society's mores and values.","When someone hears that I've written a book about 1897, I'm usually met with blank stares. And the first thing they say is, 'Was there even an L.A. back then?' A lot of people don't even think there was a city before the movies appeared. That concept of Los Angeles is so strong in the popular imagination that celebrity overrides everything.","I had a very feminist mother who exposed me not only to Planned Parenthood - my first job - but also to Betty Friedan and Colette and Naomi Wolf.","I feel like there's something interesting to learn from anyone's story, no matter their place in society. I think we've gotten really far away from that - we're in such a celebrity-obsessed culture.","Even though we look at the past through the lens of distance and think that because people are wearing different clothes or have different technology, their experiences are different, it's all the same, right? Our experience of love and sex and death are the same in any time period.","From an early age, my father stressed the power of the image, and he encouraged me to carefully control my own. He advised me, for example, never to be photographed from below, an often unflattering angle for women.","I don't like the sun, but I live in California.","I've worked with a lot of beauty companies over the years, but I really have to say that my own routine is very natural; like, I really try to be careful about the stuff I'm putting into my body, onto my body. I do believe in beauty foods - like, a lot of blueberries, salmon, kale, quinoa, avocado.","I totally don't believe that things have to be expensive for beauty. In fact, I'm always a little bit wary if they are... because I'm like, 'What kind of chemicals are in there? What's going to happen in ten years, when we find out what the side effects are?'","I want to say, embrace your sexuality, own it, be confident, but you don't have to show everything. Respect yourself, and make others respect you.","I don't label myself a feminist. I love men, but I am all about promoting a better, healthier relationship between the sexes.","In L.A., retro culture is just part of the thing you do. When we were kids, we didn't have allowances, and it was not cool to wear designer clothes. So it meant that we were into 1920s dresses when we were 13.","I can't write about people I don't feel some sort of connection to.","What I always loved about vintage clothes is that you let the woman who wore it before you live on in some way.","A 1920s dress I wore on my 21st birthday... literally disintegrated on me. I had the most wild debauched night. And that disintegrated dress sits in my closet - such a great memory.","I don't just buy a dress because it's pretty - it has to be evocative of a mood, a character I want to take on.","Los Angeles is a true postmodern city. Here, we celebrate with equal aplomb the high and the low. I am just as influenced by the punk rock attitude of local skate and surf cultures as I am by old-school glamour and stardust.","My favorite thing to do in L.A. is to be in a car with friends listening to music. The perfect time is twilight, when the setting sun is filtering through the palm trees. Back in the day, we'd be listening to the Vandals, X, or Farside. Now it would be L.A.-based bands like Dum Dum Girls, Foxygen, or Ty Segall.","For me, clothing has always been connected to history. That's what draws me in.","Sunscreen is my number one beauty product that goes on even when I am indoors.","I spend a lot more time on my wardrobe than my makeup routine and usually have to be told to brush my hair!","Fashion is not interesting unless it has some connection to something outside of that world. It's the same thing with any part of the arts: you can't just take pictures - you have to look at science, to listen to music; you have to be aware of the connections within the world. If you take something in an isolated box, it loses all significance.","Fashion can often be dictated. It's what people think we should do or wear. Style is totally personal.","My new dressing goal is to make little kids and babies smile at all the bright, clashing colours I can wear at once. It makes me laugh when I catch sight of my own reflection - life is too short not have fun!"],"Liz Murray":["When you take charge of your own narrative, it gives you a handle on it.","I feel like my life has been a series of miracles. I was in every sense a lost cause.","Like my mother, I was always saying, 'I'll fix my life one day.' It became clear when I saw her die without fulfilling her dreams that my time was now or maybe never.","If I want to be a loving, generous, giving person, I'm not going to test the waters. I'm simply going to be a loving, generous, giving person.","If I could have a family and a home one night, and all of it's gone the next, that must mean that life has the capacity to change. And then I thought, 'Whoa! That means that just as change happens to me, I can cause change in my life.'","I have just one black and white photograph left of my mother when she was younger. She was 17 when it was taken and beautiful with wispy curls and eyes that shone like dark marbles.","There was just so much attention that got focused on my story, and what that created was an opportunity for me to share what were the tools, what were the strategies, what was the thinking that had me break though those boundaries.","I've learned in my life that you really don't know what's possible until you're already doing it.","I thought, 'Let's make it a check list. What if I got my education even though I lost my mother, even though my dad is in a shelter?' and looking at these things as hurdles to go over. I could inspire myself.","My mother used to sit at the foot of my bed, and she would share her dreams with me.","When I grew up in the Bronx, we always had everyone telling us, 'Watch out for the system, watch out for child welfare, watch out, they'll get you,' and I grew up with this feeling of, 'Society is over there and they're dangerous and not safe.'","I'd been living on the streets of New York, and I was sleeping at my friends' houses, sometimes in the subway.","Shortly after I turned 13, Child Welfare took me into care. I was sent to a residential centre where girls with behavioural problems were 'evaluated'. My time there comes back to me now only in flashes of smells, images and sounds.","If I had a magic wand, I would live in a building in New York, big enough so my friends, my family could all have apartments in it. We'd raise our kids in the same space and have backyard barbecues and get old and fat together.","I was 17 and living on the streets. I had the education of technically an eighth-grader, but in reality, I had never had a formal education.","I think there is something to be said for what you can do when you don't know what you aren't supposed to be able to do.","I guess more than anything, I just realized, okay, one day I had a home to live in and my family around me. The next day, I did not.","As well as being blind, Ma turned out to have the same mental illness that her mother had had. Between 1986 and 1990, she suffered six schizophrenic bouts, each requiring her to be institutionalised for up to three months.","I had a calling inside of me. I had a sense that when I was going through experiences like living on the streets, losing my parents to AIDS, just having my whole world turned upside-down, there was this feeling inside of me like I was meant for something greater.","The lesson that people can't give me what they don't have, and if there's anything I took from it, it was: okay, I don't really expect anyone to hand me anything. There's going to be me and the world.","Ma was legally blind due to a degenerative eye disease she'd had since birth. This meant she was entitled to welfare, and our lives revolved around the first day of every month when her payment was due.","I guess if there is a big spiritual experience in my life, it is me becoming a mother.","People are surprised by the poverty and think that I wasn't cared for. But that wasn't the case - I was deeply loved.","I realized eventually that when I ran out of places to stay and found myself on the D train and in Central Park, I was actually homeless.","I realized that I had the ability to carve out a life for myself, that it was in no way limited by what had already occurred in my past. And that inspired me to go to school."],"Liz Parrish":["It is important that we work toward a better future. You can make a difference. Don't listen to people who say you are unqualified, you can start a change and see it through.","Patient zero feels great and is back to work.","I am happy to be patient zero. It is for the world, for the sick children and sick old people. My life has been good. I understand the risks but I research how people die and I am happy to say that today I do not know how I will die now. Tomorrow or in the long future I was up for a change.","The gene therapies on my body are to measure the effects on humans. There is plenty of animal research to support these gene therapies but no one was conducting human tests.","Work by Maria Blasco, Calvin Harley, Michael Fossel, Woodring Wright and Shay and Ronald Depinho in particular are of interest but there are literally thousands of articles relating to telomerase, telomeres and the biology behind it.","We will 'de-age' progressively, as cures are developed.","I think gene therapy and nanotechnology go hand in hand.","We do not collaborate with SENS at this time but we support their mission.","I hope that the image of gene therapy is changing. It seems to be.","As lifespan increases fertility rates go down all over the world. Humans will create better technology and space travel will increase. These are all good signs for the future.","BioViva is trying to help improve human health and wellbeing, and alleviate suffering. We are not trying to determine who should live or die. Everyone has a right to life without suffering.","I am patient zero.","I have aging as a disease.","Crisper is great. The future of gene therapy looks bright.","Yes, we are looking into gene therapies for immune cells to target senescent cells.","Aging is one of the most visual diseases on the planet and includes things that we all know like wrinkles and grey hair, but also brain atrophy, muscle wasting and organ damage.","Hundreds of people are undergoing gene therapy today. There are no known neurological issues.","But do remember that the most important risk factor for cancer is growing older. Most cancers occur in people over the age of 65.","Exercise and eat healthy foods in moderation. I am a vegetarian but that is a personal choice.","You have little to no response to AAV the first time your body sees it. If you used the same vector twice you would want to bump up immunosuppression. I believe there will be many new ways to deliver genes in the future as well.","Epigenetics is very important. We are keeping a close eye on iPS cells and other genetic methods of reprogramming the epigenome.","We have a battery of tests planned at regular intervals including DNA methylation analysis, gene expression profile changes, telomere length (both TAT and QTRAP measured) and various other metrics that will highlight positive changes to aging biomarkers.","I agree Maria Blasco has achieved amazing things with telomerase induction and we are hopeful this will translate to the human model.","We are looking at gene therapies to Reverse Atherosclerosis, Regenerate muscles and tissue, Improve cell signaling, Clear misfolded Proteins, Rejuvenate the immune System, Clear Senescent Cells, and Treat Monogenic Diseases.","I was awake for the therapy, it was documented by a film crew. I am proud to have taken part of helping millions of people even if it has bad results.","We are a company for the people, please get involved. Be part of the conversation.","The biotech game is quickly changing. The people must demand their use of these treatments.","Currently, we are working to deliver our anti-aging gene therapies to terminally ill people for compassionate care. Although, in the future we think that preventative medicine against aging would begin at a much younger age.","We can not control the aging reversal to a specific year today, that will come in the future. It is hypothesized that you will not reverse in physical appearance to less than a young adult. We see this in mice as well.","I would suggest always getting behind a company that shares your goals, whom you have access to the people who run it and who truly care about the world. This way we steer the ship together and many fears can be let go of.","We are using both visual biomarkers, MRI and a panel of blood and tissue testing including work on telomere length with Spectracell and Life Length and epigenetic testing.","Our goal is to build laboratories that will have the mission of a cGMP product at a reduced cost.","Gene therapy technology is much like computing technology. We had to build the super computer which cost $8 million in 1960. Now everyone has technologies that work predictably and at a cost the average person can afford.","Our science and advisory board think that nuclear lamin dysfunction is a side-effect of DNA damage and mutations, rather than the cause. We are currently trying to mend nuclear dysfunction using Human Telomerase reverse transcriptase."],"Liz Phair":["I love stretching myself musically.","Composing gives me a chance to work in multiple dimensions and helps me pare down my melodies into what is essential. Learning new skills has always energized me and scoring has opened up a world of sonic possibilities.","I am a feminist, and I define myself: Be yourself, because if you can get away with it, that is the ultimate feminist act.","I try to see interviewing as performance art, and just take it as it comes.","It seems to me like the Internet allows you to break that structure a little bit. You know, here's your CD that's going into stores, here's your EP that you offer online, here's a subscription for songs you recorded on the road, here's your live stuff streaming.","I'm very cerebral. I like to think things through.","I don't know; it just seemed like the cooler guys are playing Xbox. At least the ones I know.","Lana Del Rey seems to be bothering everybody because she allegedly 'remade' herself from a folk singing, girl-next-door type into an electro-urban kitty cat on the prowl (of course I like her), and they feel she is inauthentic.","No matter how I do this, my best songs have profanity in them.","I wear clothes that most people in the Midwest would probably deem inappropriate at my age. And I rock a bikini all summer long. I know that it's not normal, but I just don't care. I live once.","The other day I was reading a blog and I linked over to Streisand's Web site, and it was amazing politically. She's so insightful and incisive. And she also says whatever she wants.","I was raised to be a very intelligent housewife.","I think good art happens on that edge between comfortable and in a lot of pain, you know what I mean?","You're really creative when you're in an environment that you don't know how to handle. So collaborating was like that for me. I think that was one of the reasons why I knew I was gonna get a challenging reaction.","Women artists need to break barriers in order for women's experience to be valuable.","When I use the Internet, it's pretty much strictly for music. Checking out other people's web sites, what's going on, listening to music. It's pretty much a musical thing for me.","The big news already broke. The file-sharing and all that stuff, it's a done deal. And I think figuring out how to make that a fair exchange for the people that make music is still an issue.","That's what music is to me. Like, stuff that I really like to play loud. And I've got my quiet CDs, too, that I listen to around the house, but if you can't go there, then... Everyone gets so upset with me, I can't win.","Now, in music, it seems more like the popular crowd suppresses anyone who is different.","My identity has everything to do with me and my instrument. It doesn't have to do with what production style I use, or how many people played on it, whether it's sparse or grandiose or whatever. And I'm social, frankly.","Like, I kind of developed my musical style in a vacuum. Even though I listen to a lot of stuff, the way I wrote was in my bedroom, really privately. It's still the way I write, actually.","I'm really happy to be a mom, and I'm proud of the phase I'm in.","I'm competitive, so I don't like to feel marginalized by the people who sell a lot of records.","I probably had some impact, because everyone keeps telling me that I did. I like to feel like I'm coming out with something to try to make room for other young women to make their art.","I mean, I think about it, but I don't design my record to get a certain public response.","I mean, I kind of remember... I'm 36 now, so it's kind of hard for me to relate to what it was like when I was 25, or 24, but I do remember a period in time when that's how I defined who I was, by the music I listened to and the movies I went to.","I knew that collaborating on songwriting would be difficult for a lot of people, because I was known very much, for my independence and the fact that I wrote these quirky songs that were not typical structure, not typical sound - you know, really original stuff.","I just don't fit into the box.","I can't say I don't get nervous, but I really kind of enjoy performing now.","So how does Liz Phair feel about Lana Del Rey? Well, as a recording artist, I've been hated, I've been ridiculed, and conversely, hailed as the second coming. All that matters in the end is that I've been heard.","Picture being forced to talk endlessly about your feelings and listen and care when what you needed was just to get something done.","I'm working on a proper rock record, a good, old-school rock record. Finally.","I have my head screwed on right. I haven't been this way in a long time.","I don't think you can spend too much time as an artist believing what other people think.","You have to do what you need to do as an artist. You have to have that courage.","I just want to make music and make a living. I just have to find the means of doing that.","I don't know what the future holds. Anything is possible.","My nails are a disaster. If I play guitar when my nails are long, I just tear them off.","I blend my green drink every morning. I also fix my son a full-on American breakfast with bacon and toast.","It was a source of shame for my family that I was in rock and roll, which is so blue-collar. It just isn't done. And I felt it, too.","I prance around and dance by myself to hip-hop songs in the mirror.","Yeah, I like to be the maker of the art. And I like and want the money. But I don't really dig being famous.","I'm known for being annoyingly gender-focused. It's always been my platform.","Women's bodies are used to sell anything and everything because it works, it grabs people's attention, and advertisers aren't going to stop using something that works.","I don't always trust my own instincts. It would be nice if someone else would tell me what I should do with my life!","After my first record came out, I read everything. I was so amazed that I was in the press.","You know, you become an artist, you become an observer, of life, and you digest life by making art about it.","It's important to have people who will say to you that you're really off the beaten track.","Everything that people lob at you who don't know you, it all hurts. When you're doing something as simple as making music, which really, theoretically, shouldn't hurt anyone - I mean, it's a song! Step back for five seconds and laugh.","I remember even getting kicked out of a bar once because I was too loud and obnoxious.","Everyone wants to get into soundtracks. Everyone wants to do songs here and there. But, I think they want it for different reasons. I think I'm just tumbling through my life, enjoying playing with everybody.","Young kids don't have their identity, so everything is so important. Now I'm mature. I know who I am and I know what my thing is and I know what I'm bringing. It's very clear and defined.","I am comfortable performing now. I love it!","I have that thrill-seeking mentality, so when people want to know why my incarnations keep changing, or why I'll do something different than I did before, it's that same impulse.","I always give the encore over to chaos, so people can yell out requests and I can hack my way through a song that I don't really know anymore.","I'm always champing at the bit to try everything new. It's a terrible quality that I have.","I was trying to break out of the suburbs, and when I did break out, I don't think I took my whole self with me - I think I played a role of being too cool and hip.","Guys don't really don't wanna hear if it's really smart, and women feel uncomfortable if you reveal stuff they're going to have to remember they did themselves.","There's nothing wrong at all with women wanting to be women.","Wearing a veneer of perfection never did me any good.","I don't know why it surprises people that I surprise them.","My career has been riddled with controversy, which I never fully understand.","It's about the journey and the process. I do things because I love doing them, or trying them.","All parents gush about what it's like to be a parent. I love it.","I think I write songs because of pent-up feelings.","I ended up becoming so self-conscious that my songs stopped being about my life and started being about what people thought of my music. And that was really bad.","It makes sense - you wanna gather a lot of people together, and Vegas really does that well. New York can, but you know the hassles. I've lived there. It's an entirely different beast.","I don't have the same access or time to gain access to music the way I used to.","I've lost touch with a lot of that boutique-type music just because of my age, and raising my son and the multiple jobs I have at this point.","I'm just out of touch with new music in general, and I only know about it if I'm hanging out with someone that knows about it, or I catch it on YouTube.","I love scoring. Putting music to picture is a rewarding challenge and one that relies on interpretation of emotion - as in, what is the pivotal feeling in a scene and which character's point of view is driving it at any given moment?","When you love what you do, you're happy just doing it!","People hang their hopes on you fitting into their CD collection in way that they have made a space for, but I'm playing a longer game than that.","I don't like being approached by people who look at me too intensely, who needed something from me that I didn't have. I don't represent anything.","I am just like you and everyone else. I am trying to live my life as best I can.","Am I coasting on some early success? Yeah. It was a good lucky break for me. But I would rather earn my way back again than simply conform to what people are expecting."],"Liz Smith":["You can't build a reputation on what you intend to do.","One of the best parts of growing older? You can flirt all you like since you've become harmless.","The marriage didn't work out but the separation is great.","All weddings, except those with shotguns in evidence, are wonderful.","The greatest of all mistakes is to do nothing because you can only do a little. Do what you can.","Gossip is just news running ahead of itself in a red satin dress.","Begin somewhere; you cannot build a reputation on what you intend to do.","What you become is what counts.","No matter who you are or what you plan to do in life, learn to type!","To deny we need and want power is to deny that we hope to be effective.","Charlton Heston announced again today that he is suffering from Alzheimer's.","Do not join encounter groups. If you enjoy being made to feel inadequate, call your mother.","Gossip is news running ahead of itself in a red satin dress."],"Liz Torres":["I'm always striving to lose weight. And it's not a matter of wanting to be a size 3 again - I brought out my leotards, and a friend thought they were doll clothes. Being heavy isn't good for you. How long can your heart take the strain? So, I never give up, but it's hard.","I'm Hispanic - don't mess around with my coffee. Leave my beans alone.","If I really want to be heard, I have that command, but a lot of heavy women don't. When I see someone heavy working on television, I say, 'Oh, God, go girl. You do it.' You know, it shouldn't stop your life.","I have a stationary bike that I do twice a week, but I'm not really serious about it. I just do it until I get tired. And then I have a step thing that I really hate. It's hard on your knees. I have a treadmill that keeps getting stuck. It's nice to have equipment around, though, because you can sit on it anytime.","I never thought I had a career. I think Meryl Streep has a career. I have jobs that I am lucky to get... I'm one of those actresses who never turns down a part, no matter how small. I don't have the luxury of picking and choosing. I take everything."],"Liz Trotta":["The military is not a social services operation or a testing ground for gender wars. It is a fighting machine. Women are not as strong as men. Their instincts and reactions in crises are markedly different.","I'm intolerant often, especially of incompetence, particularly my own.","I'm very apolitical. I mean, after having covered politicians so much all my life, I basically have no belief in politics. But it's more of an attitude and a discipline in the way you approach life, I think, than it is just what lever you pull in a voting booth.","I'm one of these people who doesn't say that objectivity is not within our reach. I think if you're a pro, and you're a reporter, you do it. Whether you agree with the guy or not is just quite incidental. It doesn't count at all, really.","Unless you're really interested in sleaze, you should not buy 'Newsweek.'"],"Liz Tuccillo":["'The Look of Silence' was an unforgettable, chilling documentary.","Everyone wants to talk about terrible breakups. Breakups are horrible, they're relatable, and people do them badly. Everyone has a story of a terrible breakup.","Books are really fun because your 'voice' is pretty undiluted. There is a very direct connection between yourself and your audience. You will have an editor, but their job is to help you clarify or improve your voice, not change it.","A lot of people who wrote for 'Sex and the City' have gone to write about marriage and motherhood.","I find meeting someone that you fall in love with and are going to be with for the rest of your life a miracle.","In the world of book writing, an author really gets to have control over what he or she writes, which is why it is very satisfying. With the help of a great compatible editor, you really have something in the end you can call your own.","I guess that there are many ways to look at being single, and none of them should include shame or feeling less valued.","Film is the toughest one for me, as there are many fingers in the pot, so it can be disappointing. However, to have your work seen on such a large scale, that's a very exciting prospect.","Television is fantastic because you get to follow a group of characters over time, and their stories can enrich and surprise you. And you get to work with a group of people over time as well, which can be very satisfying with the right group.","Don't watch a lot of television, don't listen to a lot of music. God. What have I been doing with all my time? I'm a bore.","I love feeling like I'm 'on the pulse' of things. Nothing more satisfying, more valued, more exciting as a writer. Because shaping pop culture really means that you're saying something that a lot of people want to hear.","Sweet lordie, there is nothing more fun than getting people in a room to talk about their relationships - in a setting that everyone knows is light and fun but also real.","I have always been interested in how strange it is, when you date someone and break up, and then you both move on and continue your lives. What do you owe them, if anything, for that time intimate time spent together? What does that time mean, if anything?","I love Nicole Holofcener and Lynn Shelton, both for the same reasons: their films are funny without being forced, intimate and real while also being hugely entertaining.","I don't think I have advice for female directors as opposed to male directors. I think all first-time directors should try and be as prepared as they possibly can, because it's hard!","I think once somebody is loved, they are somewhere in your heart still loved.","You date somebody, and you have this obviously intense experience where you share a life together in whatever way that is for how many years.","Women still come up to me and say, 'If it wasn't for you, I would never have met my husband.'","The most effort you should expend should be cooking. If you could cook while lying on a couch, that would be perfect.","I started out wanting to be an actress. My sister was in this theater company in Brooklyn. I saw her in some plays, and I was immediately obsessed. I started auditioning for plays when I was about 10.","I went to NYU to study liberal arts.","My first job in acting was in a Scott Baio movie called 'I Love N.Y.' My role was Italian Girl. I sent my 8x10 to a casting agent in the booklet, 'The Ross Report,' which is where all the agents were listed before that little thing called the Internet. I read for this tiny part. I couldn't have been more excited to get it.","I was about 29 or 30, and I started writing monologues for myself. I felt I got more immediate encouragement from that than I ever had in acting.","Writers are always sort of threatening to direct, and sometimes they do, and sometimes they don't."],"Liz Vassey":["Notice the small things. The rewards are inversely proportional.","There is no such thing as low maintenance or high maintenance, just a bunch of women hoping for a capable mechanic.","I have this old worn-out, skintight T-shirt that I love. That's sexy.","I don't mind a gut. In fact, I would prefer a guy to have a gut than be too built.","I have a thing for men's boxer briefs and a tank top. If I'm wearing them, I'm a happy gal.","My biggest turn-on has to be brains, intelligence.","I've been acting professionally since I was 15 years old, and after a while, you get really tired of people telling you one thing and then doing another.","Go for the girl who can eat a proper meal. If she's passionate about food, you'll most likely be fortunate in other venues.","Don't paint a nasty picture of your exes. We'll justifiably wonder what made you stay in those heinous situations in the first place."],"Liz Williams":["I've written a detective series myself, set in an imaginary, and slightly futuristic, Chinese city. The novels have an extremely tenuous relationship with the real world, since the hero is the city's Hell and ends up with a sidekick who is a demon.","You can, I think, have a quiet and steady protagonist and not run the risk of terminal dullness as long as exciting things happen to them and around them, and crime is the ideal genre for making this come about.","Only in the English countryside could violent death remain something that is 'cosy.'","Because contemporary paganism is essentially so new, its underlying ethical structure is not particularly sophisticated.","There are a few people who are, let's say, personality-challenged, who would like to set up a cult, but in large part they fail due to the innate stroppiness and independence of their fellow pagans.","Authors as diverse as Rudyard Kipling, E. Nesbit, and J. R. R. Tolkien have shaped modern paganism as greatly as any theological underpinnings.","Much of what Karl Popper contributed to the philosophy of science has now passed into mainstream thought, into the currency of that nebulous, tricky ontology known as 'common sense.'","Just so that we are clear on this, I am in favour of teaching children about different beliefs. I am not in favour of indoctrinating them in any particular belief, including my own: these issues should be presented as beliefs, not as fact.","I think that the power of the Silent Minute lies in its inherent lack of external direction: what participants actually do during that minute - prayer, contemplation, focus - is up to them.","I have issues with anyone who tries to claim that science is unworkable - creationists who deny evidence for past history, yet are happy to benefit from the products of the methodology that they otherwise deny.","For me, spiritual practice is a lot closer to art than science.","Some religious practitioners make absolutist claims for their beliefs: I've no interest in doing this, nor do I have any interest in converting people, which is doubtless a relief to anyone who has feared finding me on their doorstep asking if they'd like to know more about Odin.","Contemporary paganism gives me a subjective lens through which the world in which I live can be interpreted on an aesthetic and an ethical basis. I'm interested in narrative, myth, and story, in folklore and the way we connect to the turning of the seasons and the natural world."],"Liza Donnelly":["All cartoonists are linked together in the world - it's our language, one we can communicate in.","One of the perks of being a 'New Yorker' cartoonist is that you get to hang around with interesting people. My fellow cartoonists are all interesting, and all highly creative.","It was actually an Israeli cartoonist, Nurit Karlin, who made me think that I could draw for 'The New Yorker.' I saw her work published in the magazine in the early 1970s - she was the only woman working as a cartoonist at 'The New Yorker' at the time.","I'm not a politician or a political expert, but I believe that there are many ways to look at peace."],"Liza Lapira":["Winter makes me want to rage. You know how there's road rage? I feel like in New York or upstate New York, you're just like, 'Dammit,' because you're so cold.","I like to talk. That's why I can't karaoke in a private room. Those types of shenanigans are only good in a public space. I got to say, though, with smartphones and instant upload of everything, our generation and definitely the next generation coming up, it's going to be hard to act a fool.","Winter makes me want to rage.","I think the first thing that I really did was 'Traffic Light,' which was more of a half-hour sitcom. And from there, I just got more comedic roles.","I like to talk. That's why I can't karaoke in a private room. Those types of shenanigans are only good in a public space."],"Liza Minnelli":["Smoking is one of the leading causes of all statistics.","I've said it before, but it's absolutely true: My mother gave me my drive, but my father gave me my dreams. Thanks to him, I could see a future.","Well, I'll tell you something, this wedding is something that I will always, always cherish. It was a show of love and support and kindness like I'd never seen from the people, and that's who I entertain. I entertain the people.","The regrets of yesterday and the fear of tomorrow can kill you.","Dream on it. Let your mind take you to places you would like to go, and then think about it and plan it and celebrate the possibilities. And don't listen to anyone who doesn't know how to dream.","Reality is something you rise above.","I feel like I haven't done my best work yet. I feel like there's a world of possibilities out there.","But God really did bless me, you know? He really said, All right. Come on. I'm still waiting for you. Get over here. Get over here.","I think that's the greatest gift one can have: point of view. You know? I've come to believe that if you have a bad memory of something, change it.","Anything is possible in this world. I really believe that.","In Hollywood now when people die they don't say, 'Did he leave a will?' but 'Did he leave a diary?'","You have to work hard for it, but first you have to want it, and then you have to dream on it.","I am deeply saddened by the death of my dear friend, Dudley Moore.","I feel like there's a world of possibilities out there.","What I'm saying is that I tried very hard to give them my reality and my reality is kind of interesting.","The director, of course, was Bob Fosse. But again, I worked with my father to prepare for the role.","I'm not a very good singer. I just know how to present a song, and honey, I think I've been through enough to do it right.","I've decided that I am totally against jewelry. So I have all fake. There's no reason to have real diamonds. People think it's real anyway.","I walk fast. Keep moving. Always be a moving target. Marilyn Monroe taught me that.","I think every time you go to do something, it's a challenge. Somebody said to me, 'You've done it all. If you could do anything right now, what would you do?' I said, 'I'd do everything I did better.'","I believe all drunks go to heaven, because they've been through hell on Earth.","It was no great tragedy being Judy Garland's daughter. I had tremendously interesting childhood years - except they had little to do with being a child.","Whenever we were on a plane, we had a family.","Audiences are the same all over the world, and if you entertain them, they'll respond.","And what I liked the most about any project was that when it was good, you had a bunch of people trying to accomplish something together who were all acting together as one - that's the most exciting time for me.","Growing up in Hollywood it seemed like every kid was the child of some star.","I feel like I haven't done my best work yet.","I mean, I inherited the disease of alcoholism, and I learned early to get help when I needed it.","If we had a hard time, my mother would sit me down and we would talk about it, and she kept talking and kept processing until we started to laugh about it.","Initially, I wanted to be an ice skater, but then when I was 13 I saw Bye Bye Birdie, and that was it - I wanted to be on Broadway.","My mother was an artist and highly strung, whereas my father was much calmer.","So I would dance and she would sing, and it was kind of a family thing. Performing was part of our world.","To the general public, show business may just mean the artistic part, but the dollar and cents element is the reality every performer has to face.","Well, when I was growing up it was Ozzie and Harriet on TV - nobody's parents were like that.","You see, that's another thing that my parents gave me: an enormously great sense of humor.","Well, we have theatrical parties. It's not me singing. People like to get up and jam on the piano.","Well, I've known Elizabeth almost all of her life and almost all of my life. And I love her with all of my heart and she's always been there for me. She's a wonderful, wonderful dame. She's a great lady.","The thing is, is to raise your hand. It's not to hide, and it's not to try and pretend or do anything like that. You raise your hand, that's the best thing about it.","Now, having had this experience, I can't say really what they were looking for. I don't know their minds. But every time I see a reality show, it seems that the most entertaining parts on other reality shows are when they make their guests look foolish.","No, I'm a theatrical, live performer or a movie performer.","No, I mean, I most certainly date and go out.","I'm fine, and my hips are fine. My false knee is fine. My false hips are fine. Everything's cooking.","I worked very hard, but I think it's unfair to make it all sound like it's all David's fault.","I thought maybe, just by never preaching, never doing any of that stuff because it doesn't work. By just maybe the power of example and some laughs, maybe somebody might go take a walk.","I mean, I inherited the disease of alcoholism, and I learned early to get help when I needed it. I always went to people who knew more than I did.","I know that. I'm having a ball. I'm not slap happy. I'm just filled up with joy and with peace and with all kinds of things that have eluded me for quite a few years. And they're back and they're thriving.","I had the drink after I fell out of bed. It hurt.","I had a one day slip, Matt. So what do you do? You get up and you go on, and you try not to do it again.","He's a good tough producer, yes. But I don't think that he's unreasonable unless he feels threatened. And when somebody's in your home, I think everybody in the home gets threatened.","He was doing - Ray was designing the clothes for my mom's show from California. And one of the first appearances I ever made on television was on my mother's show and Ray and Bob did the clothes for that. It has been a long time.","Growing up in Hollywood it seemed like every kid was the child of some star. We had no idea that other people would think we were special, because there was no other lifestyle to compare it to.","But my brother Joey was there, and my sister Tina Nina Minnelli was there.","But I don't think there's any reason to get married again, especially after what I've been through.","Ben Vereen is going to be on the show with me, too.","What good is sitting all alone in your room?","My mother gave me my drive but my father gave me my dreams.","I was sitting on my mom's lap across from my father to see Kay Thompson at Ciro's. And I always remember this energy force, this woman flying around the room and singing these harmonies so everyone went, 'Wow!' So I thought, 'That's what I want to do.'","It's like being an athlete; you get into a certain shape where you really have the right wind, because it's all to do with breath. Because singing and dancing at the same time is not easy!","Never stop moving, or you'll stop moving. I go to dance class every morning, and it's just good to stay strong; I like being healthy.","I had no interest in filming. I sometimes went to the studios with my dad, but it was slow-going; it was boring to watch. I always ended up in the rehearsal hall watching the dancing. That's what I liked to do.","Half the time, I feel like I'm 12. And the rest of the time, I feel like I'm 80. So I guess I'm somewhere in between. No, I feel great. I've got my health, and that's the most important thing.","The male gay community seems to be very into female singers. I think it could be the songs we sing. They're more open with their feelings. And they have good taste!","I thought that making movies was drab. I'd lived through that. And I didn't want to use my parents, ever... They didn't want to push me into this business.","I was given an enormous amount of love by my parents.","Working with Dudley Moore was so hilarious. I don't know how we got anything done because everybody was laughing so hard, but he was such a wonderful man, and he had a kindness and a musicality and a dearness to him that was triumphant.","I don't sing as well as my mother. I'm a good actress. I'm not that good a singer.","Nobody sang better than my mom. That's why I've never even thought of singing for singing sake. I've always thought of a song as an acting piece, as a way to say something.","First I wanted to be an ice skater, and then I saw 'Bye, Bye Birdie,' and everything changed. I'm glad I learned through the process of theater.","I love finding talent. Just to encourage people is a good thing. Every night, the audience encourages me. I'm just passing it on.","I'm so grateful for everything that's happened. I love my work. People have such hurdles - I just wanted to perform, and I wanted my parents to be proud, and they were proud."],"Lizz Winstead":["Whoever's president I'm not going to be short on material.","The political satirist usually votes against their own interests, but the bottom line is that it doesn't really matter.","I do a lot of reading of news so I can be smarter, and I do a lot of watching TV news so I can know why Americans aren't very smart. Then I can point out the hypocrisy of politicians or the media.","Opportunities present themselves to me. That's how my whole life has been pretty much. I've been lucky.","It just seems OK these days to throw women under the bus. Like we're a bargaining chip.","We live in a nation where corporations are people.","We've got a deeply flawed political system with an insane overreaching extremist element, with a Supreme Court that is completely loony."],"Lizzie Andrew Borden":["I knew there was an old axe down cellar; that is all I knew.","I don't know what I have said. I have answered so many questions and I am so confused I don't know one thing from another. I am telling you just as nearly as I know.","I was on the stairs coming down when she let him in.","I don't know whether Mrs. Borden is out or in; I wish you would see if she is in her room.","I thought I would go out, and see if the air would make me feel any better.","I think he came to the front door and rang the bell, and Maggie let him in, and he said he had forgotten his key; so I think she must have been down stairs.","When I first came down stairs, for two or three minutes I went down cellar to the water closet.","I was feeling well enough to eat the pears.","Go for Dr. Bowen as soon as you can. I think father is hurt.","I always went to my sister, because she was older and had the care of me after my mother died.","Last winter when I was coming home from church one Thursday evening, I saw somebody run around the house again. I told my father of that.","I have been away a great deal in the daytime, occasionally at night.","My door was open part of the time, and part of the time I tried to get a nap and their voices annoyed me, and I closed it. I kept it open in summer more or less, and closed in winter.","Maggie went out of doors to wash the windows and father came out into the kitchen and said he did not know whether he would go down to the post office or not. And then I sprinkled some handkerchiefs to iron.","I was not up stairs when he came home; no, sir.","I know what she used to do sometimes. She kept her best cape she wore on the street in there, and she used occasionally to go up there to get it and to take it into her room. She kept a great deal in the guest room drawers.","She told me she had a note, somebody was sick.","I did not hear her go or come back, but I supposed she went.","She said she was going out, and would get the dinner. That is the last I saw her, or said anything to her.","I said I thought first I was on the stairs; then I remembered I was in the kitchen when he came in.","I never eat any breakfast.","I can't do anything in a minute.","I did not see his face, because he was all covered with blood.","I had no occasion for an apron on that morning.","Oh, Mrs. Churchill, do come over, someone has killed father."],"Lizzie Armitstead":["I mean, for me, the reason I ride my bike and race is because I love doing it, not because I'm seeking recognition for it.","I remember taking my stabilisers off my bike with my dad in the back garden. It was a small little bike, and it was called Poppy, had balloons on it, and was purple.","The only thing that I can do - and the only thing that I've always done - is to ride my bike fast and get my head down and control the things I can control.","I never quit. The times when I have quit in the past because I couldn't face trying harder have stayed with me, and the guilt is not worth it.","There is no pathway for female GB road cyclists, but at the same time, if you are wanting to be the best in the world, you have to forge your own pathway. It's not that things should be there on a plate for you. You have to work really hard, and that's what I've done, and I didn't let it stop me.","It's something that can get overwhelming and frustrating, the sexism I experience in my career. It's just obviously a big issue in women's sport, like salaries, media coverage, just general things that you have to cope with in your career.","There's a lot of bunch finishes, which are hectic and kind of dangerous; you need a lot of luck to win those.","I have to make sure I get the right amount of protein and iron, and I take supplements for that. I think people would be surprised if they saw my diet, though; it's very normal.","Eating well is really important to me. That means having balanced meals, never missing a meal, never skipping a meal, having a balanced diet, and never doing anything extreme.","I don't look at my emails on the weekend or after 6 o'clock in the day.","I have got lots of silver medals, from Delhi in 2010 and London in 2012, so it would be nice to pick up some golds, and the Commonwealth Games is a great place to start.","I am sorry for causing anyone to lose faith in sport.","I find weddings too procedural sometimes. I just want a big, fun party.","I'm quite un-traditional.","I feel really lucky. There wasn't a doubt in my mind when Phil asked me to marry him.","There are a lot of people I look up to and respect, but there's nobody really specific I would call a hero.","The UCI have to make the decision to put in rules into women's cycling that they have in men's cycling: you know, like a minimum budget to run a women's team and that sort of thing so that it becomes more professional.","I'm old-fashioned.","I remember if the telephone rang after 9 o'clock in the house, my mother would say, 'Who's ringing at this time?' We just wouldn't answer the phone.","I love being world champion.","Any woman in any career has to think about when they have children, if they want to have children, and how it's going to affect their career.","When I have children, it will be my choice, and I won't feel under any pressure.","When I have a family, I will be retired.","I won't try and combine training and a family.","I don't particularly buy into all the nutrition fads and that sort of thing.","As long as my weight is healthy, then I eat what I want.","It's very special that the Olympics is in London. As a first Olympic experience, it's going to be pretty incredible.","I'm a very goal-oriented person, so I look at the specific demands of a certain race and tailor my training towards that.","I used to think that in order to be lean, I had to under-eat.","I eat a lot more now than I ever used to. I have taken a real interest in nutrition and believe in the difference that makes when fueling your body correctly. That means never skipping a meal and making sure that my diet supports my training needs.","I have a strong, inspiring, and professional group of women around me with Boels-Dolmans. We race and train incredibly hard as a team.","Most women's races don't pay much at all.","I had to find my own path, and in some ways, it's been a good thing.","My focus has to be on my career.","I'm quite a strong person, and I've become even stronger.","When you are on a climb, you always pick out people's words of encouragement, and it can push us on, without doubt.","You can't expect a woman who's holding down a part-time job to train for the biggest race in the world. She has to have a minimum wage, and I think it's something that is pretty crazy that we don't have that.","At the end of the day, cycling is a business, so we have to be able to offer something to a sponsor, and without exposure, that's going to be difficult, but that's where the UCI perhaps has to be a little bit stronger.","It's not always about gold medals, I think. It has to be about development, and we are missing that in U.K. at the moment.","As I get older, it's getting more frustrating because I'm starting to think about what I'm going to do after cycling, and I may be pushed to study alongside riding in order to prepare for retirement - all those things the professional blokes don't really have to think about.","Outside the Olympics, there are massive discrepancies within all sports. But the positive side for me is that the Olympics are the biggest platform there is, and there's total equality across all sports.","I never expected to compete at home in a UCI women's race - let alone as world champion.","I can't feel sorry for myself.","I never gave up, and for that, I can be proud of myself.","I can't pick up the phone to everybody that doubts me and explain myself.","Crossing the line and being world champion, I've always dreamt about it, and now I've done it. It's quite a surreal feeling, but obviously very special.","You've got all that 130 km. of being totally focused, and as soon as you cross the line, it takes a few seconds to realise what's happened.","There's been a lot of champions before me, and I'm sure there will be ahead of me.","As far as I'm concerned, as soon as you reach your goal, then that's the box ticked for me. I don't feel the need to repeat titles or repeat victories; as soon as I get the one, then I'm happy.","There are lots of things that could be done. We could get more help from the UCI, like forcing Pro-Tour teams to have a women's equivalent.","The problem, as a female athlete, is that you don't want to come across as negative and moaning.","It's difficult to change things in a positive way.","The harder the race, the better.","It's no big deal if I disappoint strangers.","My family will be disappointed only if I'm disappointed, and hopefully that won't be the case. I'm trying to view the Olympics like any other race and I think the London course will suit my style.","I've been successful because I've never been someone to shy away from taking responsibility.","It's fantastic news that the Aviva Women's Tour will continue in 2016.","As a British rider, it's a privilege to be able to compete on home roads. The British public have really taken to cycling, and you can see that when the race goes through different towns: the community really gets behind it.","I'm excited to see the growth in women's cycling, and I think the Women's Tour has had a really positive impact on that change.","I'm not a victim, and I don't need to behave like one.","I have never cheated anybody out of a victory, I have worked hard for every single race that I have won.","For the rest of my life, I realise people are going to ask questions of me, but at the end of the day, I am a clean athlete, and I have worked hard.","It hurts me to consider anybody questioning my performances.","Integrity is something I strive for in every part of my life.","I will hold my head high in Rio and do my best for Great Britain.","I need to learn to be happy and enjoy the achievement rather than already thinking about what I could have done better.","I am proud, but I'm annoyed with myself for not believing in myself enough.","I'm suited to harsh conditions, I don't like racing in the heat.","Cyclists need to obey the Highway Code, not run red lights, and not ride with iPods on, and motorists need to be more respectful and look out for cyclists.","I pay my taxes.","I like being part of the Great Britain setup. I like feeling I'm at a race that is important and the pressure that goes with it.","I'm 100 per cent motivated. I haven't done enough yet in cycling to be satisfied.","I've never thought about it in training, 'If I do this, then maybe I can be on the SPOTY shortlist.'","It's really important for cycling and for women to be on a sporting stage which is in the mainstream and across the board, not just my own sport.","As a female athlete, I think it's really important to stand up on a podium and represent females and what we're capable of, and I always try to make political statements with what I do rather than with headlines.","A family is something that I definitely want, but I'm 26, so I have plenty of time, and I try not to kind of confuse the two because, if I'm lucky enough, I want to make having a baby a personal decision rather than a career-defined one.","I'm not at the point of accepting it yet - but I will have to come to the point of accepting that people will doubt me forever.","I will never cheat in any walk of life.","I feel extremely guilty that I've had to put team-mates through extra media questions.","I think about Rio every day. Every day in training, it's something that drives me forward. I want to be Olympic champion.","I am one of the best in the world, and it's a position I should get used to being in.","I've got a lot of silvers. Second seems to be something I end up being. I don't want to be the bridesmaid forever.","A world championship medal on the road is something that I'm missing from my CV.","I could have been banned. That's what I was most scared about. All the hard work being for nothing. It was basically my livelihood and my sport being taken away from me. It was everything.","I'm one of the most tested athletes in the world.","I can only tell you that I am a clean athlete and an honest person.","In terms of being a famous person, it hasn't changed anything. It's not important for me.","I have to be a leader now. I need to shoulder responsibility more than I used to. It's changed me, but I'm OK with that.","I trust myself, the way I prepare. I feel like I know what I'm doing.","Cycling is a business.","Most of my friends are non-cyclists. They are interested and proud of my achievements, but, equally, if I stopped tomorrow, they wouldn't say much about it!","It has been difficult to get back on the saddle, particularly after getting whiplash and concussion, but it's just about understanding that sometimes it's OK to say, 'I don't want to get back on my bike for week.'","I need to be fit and strong, and I don't want to carry any excess fat.","I need to go out on a ride feeling full and feeling ready.","The Rio experience for me is going to be completely different to London.","It's fantastic to have the opportunity to race at home, so I wouldn't miss it.","I am not a robot; I am a member of a family - my commitment to them comes over and above my commitment to cycling."],"Lizzie Brochere":["In my day-to-day, I do a bit of yoga, I go biking, I read, I watch shows, I go to music concerts.","Each time that I have two or three days off, I'm off somewhere in California.","I'm happy to work in the States because there are so many different and interesting projects. I'll go wherever people want me to work.","Of course I believe in aliens. I think it's very egocentric to think that there's nothing else with intelligence in the whole universe.","It'd be interesting to see a film from an alien perspective. Maybe we're the weird ones.","I just got my work visa to shoot 'American Horror Story,' and my official status is 'alien with extraordinary abilities.'","In France, we don't yet have the craft that American TV does or big studios like Paramount. It was so cool going through those famous gates when you have your own little pass and picture on it. Woo hoo, I'm going to work!"],"Lizzo":["I love kimonos because you can just throw them on over anything. Ever since I got my first kimono from Lane Bryant in high school and thought, 'This is amazing; I can wear it with everything!'","I work on myself daily to be a better person. When I react in a negative way to somebody, I sit back and think about why I did it, so I'm always working on myself, and my music is the same.","My mother and father taught me about black excellence and dynasty. They experienced racism personally, and when something like that happens to you and not around you, you develop a different perception than someone who has never experienced racism a day in their lives.","Every time I rap about being a big girl in a small world, it's doing a couple things: it's empowering my self-awareness, my body image, and it's also making the statement that we are all bigger than this; we're a part of something bigger than this, and we should live in each moment knowing that.","I don't really shop a lot. I order things online. When I travel, I'll get some pieces along the way.","Dress for your body type. Some people are blessed enough to be able to throw on something that Beyonce wears and it looks amazing. If I try to go against the grain and wear something that my body doesn't like, it's going to show.","I like that I'm not typical. I like that I'm called 'no-genre hip-hop.'","Everyone looks to an artist for something more than just the music, and that message of being comfortable in my own skin is number one for me.","I feel like I've started to create my own culture of being a voice for something, and that's what people want to know about. I love that because I am a woman and because I a rap, and I look the way I look, I can connect with the demographic of people who feel like they have a voice in me.","I'm glad I'm a woman; I'm glad I'm a rapper because I get to speak to these people who did not get spoken for in this genre.","My formative years were in Houston. I was in middle school, and everyone was dropping the last half of their names and adding an 'o' to the end. My little crew that I had, we were an all-female rap group, and everyone had an 'o' at the end of their name. I was Lisso. Then this dude started getting lazy with it, saying Lizzo.","There's a lot of influences that I have from Detroit that are subliminal. I mean, I spent the first 10 years of my life there. My mom and dad were born and raised there, so a lot of that rubbed off on me. When I get angry, sometimes a Detroit accent comes out.","Minneapolis just embraced me. There are a lot of weirdos here. It's awesome, because I'm a weirdo. Thankfully, the city embraced me with open arms. A lot about Minneapolis helped carve my musicality and open my eyes. The whole town is so open-minded compared to like, you know, Texas.","I was raised on gospel. I remember hip-hop and rock music were secular, so basically, for my first ten years living in Detroit, I was on gospel. But when I moved to Houston, that's when I got to open up my musical horizons.","When I was born, my father named me Melissa, and I am still Melissa, but I got the nickname Lizzo around the time I was in the Cornrow Clique.","When I first saw Destiny's Child, I was in the fifth grade, and it made me want to sing and make music, and there would be these freestyles on the radio for what seemed like hours; it was just so cool to me.","When I was 19, I joined a rock band, and that's when I began to say, 'Okay, this is something that I could take seriously.' When I came to Minneapolis, it just refined everything.","First Avenue is one of my favorite places to play. All along, they've treated me with respect.","When we're on stage doing a song about positive body image or another about female empowerment, everyone out there is super into it and right there with us. It's been awesome. I feel like we fit right in.","From a young age, I saw and placed importance on spirituality within religion.","Seeing people catch a feeling in their spirit and sprint the aisles of the church while my cousins played driving, uplifting gospel stuck with me. I let that same feeling wash over me when I experience and perform music.","The fight still isn't people of colour versus white. It's the people versus the system built to keep us down. That's the first line of the Constitution. And the system is manmade but is made of no man. Everyone, regardless of class, creed, culture and ethnicity can fight the system and help to break it down.","If you are confident in yourself and however you want yourself to be presented, and you're doing well and doing it because you want to do it and not because someone is pressuring you, then more power to you.","I enjoy female rappers, not because they're female but because I can connect to them more.","I'm not a girl who started getting into music and using my femininity to get attention. When I was getting into it, it was all pure skill.","No one said, 'This is the best female rapper.' It's more like, 'Lizzo can really rap.' I think its because I'm not that sexy girl. I'm that beast girl.","I spent a lot of time star-gazing, writing, and learning languages when the other kids were doing cooler things in Detroit.","I knew a lot of girls who just wanted to be famous, and if that's your goal, that's awesome; that just wasn't enough for me.","I was so moved by music that I wanted to create it as well, but once you decide that's what you want to do with your life, to be successful, you have to be business-minded, too.","I don't look to celebrities for style anymore because I've learned the chain of command. They are being dressed by a stylist who's getting inspiration from a 16-year-old kid running the streets of Melbourne, Australia. Once I learned that chain of command, I just started taking it to the streets."],"Lizzy Caplan":["Had 'Bridesmaids' not ended up being so amazing and successful, we would never have been able to make 'Bachelorette.' So we are in awe of 'Bridesmaids' and totally owe them so much.","I try to bring elements of my own personality to every character I've played, but I think I'm pretty similar to the character I'm playing now. The biggest departure would have to have been Freaks and Geeks Sara, who was this sort of subordinate and shy girl.","I think, as an actress, people get on your case if you do the same thing over and over again. But if you get too far away from that, people don't like that, either.","When I was younger, I actually wanted to be a CIA agent. Really. I even did the online questionnaire.","Don't peak in high school.","I think being mean to people in high school is healthy. It's sort of like you're in this situation with all these other kids and sometimes you need to get your aggression out. And if you'd had people be mean to you before, it really does build character.","You'd be surprised. Girls like sensitive, namby-pamby guys.","There's only so many times you can read how ugly you are and how much people hate you.","It's weird, It's really weird to be called a breakout star. And some people are referring to my show as the new 'Friends', which I can't really even wrap my head around.","I had a bat mitzvah, was confirmed, went to Jewish summer camp, I go to temple for the High Holy Days. I think, like most people in their early 20s, I kind of strayed away from it. I think once I have a family I'll be back into it.","Everybody hangs out with everybody, which is very strange for a cast this large and this young. We're all cool and down to earth and not caught up in this maniacal business at all... . Everybody really, really likes everybody else.","I think it's necessary to identify with anything - with any character you play, there's got to be something in common, so you can link up to that person, even if it's like one tiny thing. But it's equally fun to play somebody completely different, and trying to find what that thing is to make it.","'Save the Date' feels like a quiet story about two sisters and the men in their lives, kind of reminiscent of the quieter rom-coms of the 1990s; it's very character-driven and not as wedding-focused.","I really unfortunately don't have tons of hilarious Sundance stories, because really I am not the biggest fan of hanging out, but the reason why is because I never go see other people's movies and I think that's the way to do it.","For the past few years, I've been more selective than I have any right to be, but I think that's finally starting to work in my favor. I think I get way too much credit for making what people consider to be smart choices, but it's only because I made a decision to stop worrying about making money.","There's definitely a luxury to the fluidity of not being a mega-star. I've done a ton of really, really odd, off-the-wall movies. There's this movie I did called 'Queens of Country' a couple of summers ago that is so bananas, and if I was at a certain level, I probably would not have done that movie.","When you're shooting a network television show it inevitably starts airing a few episodes in, and depending on the ratings and the response from the public, you find yourself tweaking your performance or the scripts go in a different direction.","'Party Down' is the most fun I've ever had working in my life. We shoot 10-episode seasons and we shoot it in 10 weeks, so it's very brief: 4-day episode shoots. You never get sick of anybody, and it never feels like a drag. It's way, way, way too short.","I'm really awkward when people recognize me. I'm not good at it, and for the most part it hadn't happened to me until 'True Blood,' and then, all of a sudden, it started happening all the time.","I never get recognized for 'Mean Girls.' I can be walking around with Daniel Franzese, who's in the movie and a friend of mine, and people will come up to him and start freaking out and have no idea who I am.","I don't think you should be allowed to eat in a restaurant if you haven't waited tables at least once. It's so irritating when I see people being rude to waiters, like, it makes me want to slit their throats! Like, really? You're really this inconsiderate?","I'm still waiting to hit it big. But there was the moment when I didn't have to work at the restaurant anymore, which is the milestone for every actor. When your job is just to be an actor and not to have to do anything else.","I think there's something very lovely and hilarious about exploring the particular neuroses of the female mind. It's just not the same thing with men. I mean, there are exceptions, but for the most part, women beat themselves up in their heads more. They overanalyze stuff far more than men do.","I really fancied myself a comedic actress.","Comedy is not something that a person can fake or learn how to do.","I do think, oddly, that a comedic actor has a better chance of pulling off a dramatic role than a great dramatic actor has of being able to pull off a highly comedic role.","It's scary to sign a six-year contract for something that you don't necessarily know about. And yet I did that most every year. I've done a lot of failed pilots.","I really like doing television shows, and I anticipated doing a comedy, because that's the place I feel the most comfortable - those are the risks I want to take.","On 'Masters of Sex,' especially in the pilot, everybody was showing up word-perfect, and you're expected to show up word-perfect.","As an actress - and as an actor, too, but it's worse for actresses - you constantly get picked apart for how you look.","I'm choosy to a fault. You want to hold out for a project that means something. You're the one who's there working fifteen hours a day, and if you don't believe in it, it can feel a whole lot longer.","I've loved being the sarcastic chick, but I didn't want to be her forever.","The family you were raised in, the time period you were born in, and the part of the country you're in absolutely shape your view on sex, which shapes a huge part of anybody's personality.","There are some of us who are just born with a more adventurous spirit than others.","My first acting role as a kid was on 'Freaks and Geeks.'","I was a Russian dancer in my elementary school production of 'Fiddler on the Roof' when I was in third grade or fourth grade. I was one of the younger kids accepted into the play, and the plays were pretty impressive, let me say.","Everyone who made 'Save the Date,' like the writers and the director, they're all happily married and not anti-marriage at all, so that was kind of interesting to me.","I find that break-ups are so much easier when you can hate the person.","I find that working with friends is always the goal, even if it's just one person. Because the comedy community is kind of insular, it's easy to run into people you've worked with, even if you worked with someone on something for a day, or whatever.","I try to find some similarities between myself and the characters, even if it's the tiniest thing.","I have no drawing talent whatsoever. I cannot do it.","I think I get way too much credit for making what people consider to be smart choices, but it's only because I made a decision to stop worrying about making money. I had done network sitcoms. I had a nest egg.","I had to do a lot of dancing in 'Queens of Country.'","In the early days, I just got lucky. I would audition for everything and just happen to land in something pretty respectable, like 'Freaks and Geeks,' my first job, which was a complete fluke.","I have a special ability to spot TV shows that don't go past two seasons; that's my gift.","I did the whole non-dairy thing for a year.","None of my friends are in the entertainment industry.","I saw 'Clueless' five times in the theatre when I was growing up.","Whenever you're starting a new show, you have these awkward first lunches and meetings that are sort of mandatory, and everybody shows up, but nobody knows each other.","I find reality television to be so delectable.","I have a habit of getting very obsessive about one thing, but it usually lasts no more than three days."],"Lleyton Hewitt":["I'm more in that Rafa Nadal high-energy high-octane mold out there. I wear that emotion on the court. That's how I play my best tennis. People either like that or not. And I can't change that: that's who I am on a tennis court.","Matches are won and lost so many times in the locker room.","I liked Pat Cash, and I loved Mats Wilander. I went to the Australian Open with my parents, and I used to watch Wilander being cheered on by the Swedish fans, and with his game style being like mine, I drew comparisons with him.","I'm not a guy who needs to read motivation books.","Tennis players go into a press conference, and almost every one of them is the same. We do very little differently on a day-to-day basis.","I don't have too much spare time, but I try to play games as much as possible. I played a little growing up, but I never played any tennis games before.","You always love playing in finals at any tournament. The grand slams and stuff like that are obviously the priorities but any titles go on your record.","I am two different people. What you see on the court is just natural for me. I wear my heart on my sleeve. I have always said 'C'mon' purely to fire myself up. Off the court, I am a lot shyer. I stick to my team and my family and people I trust.","I have sometimes played my best Davis Cup matches away from home when you stay in the moment a bit more. But it is tough when half the crowd are spitting on you.","Even when I was No. 1 in the world, I was taking it one match at a time. I never was a player to look too far ahead, the way draws can pan out.","When I was a kid in Adelaide, I dreamed of becoming No. 1 in the world, winning a grand slam and the Davis Cup for Australia.","I was lucky enough to win the Davis Cup in my first year in 1999. I won my first slam at the U.S. Open in 2001 and became world No. 1 later that year. By the age of 20, I'd done it all.","When I go out to play, I still believe I'm as good as anyone out there. I don't have to prove anyone wrong. I know what I've done and how well I can play.","I'm not to eager to play tennis in my spare time. I'm more interested in doing gym work and stuff like that. We have a lot of schools and courts around where I live, so if I really want to play, I don't need to go too far.","My video game character is a bit better looking than me, actually. I don't think he has to worry about his hair getting messed up.","Oh, I get pretty fired up on the court. I try to play with a lot of emotion, especially when I'm playing in front of a large crowd. I want to go out and do my best, and to do that, I have to play with the most energy possible.","I've probably put up with more criticism than a lot of people out there. At the end of the day, you block out everything, especially with your personal life.","I'm fortunate: I can play as long as I want to play. There's no coach or trainer who is going to say to me that I'm dropped or sacked, it's time to move on. I can play as long as I want to play.","There are people who love you and people who hate you, but for me, more so, people only think they know me by how I act or perform on a tennis court.","I'm one injury away from hanging up the racket at any time.","I'd much rather win in three or four sets than go the distance all the time; I seem to put everyone through the wringer quite a bit."],"Lloyd Alexander":["I had always been interested in mythology. I suppose my brief stay in Wales during World War II influenced my writing, too. It was an amazing country. It has marvelous castles and scenery.","We learn more by looking for the answer to a question and not finding it than we do from learning the answer itself.","Fantasy is hardly an escape from reality. It's a way of understanding it.","My concern is how we learn to be genuine human beings.","All that writers can do is keep trying to say what is deepest in their hearts.","I guess there's only two possible places ideas can come from. One is the outside: everything that happens to you and everything that you do in life. And the other is the inside part: your own personality and imagination, and no two people are alike, like fingerprints.","King Arthur was one of my heroes - I played with a trash can lid for a knightly shield and my uncle's cane for the sword Excalibur.","My parents were horrified when I told them I wanted to be an author.","My family pleaded with me to forget literature and do something sensible, such as find some sort of useful work.","Shakespeare, Dickens, Mark Twain, and so many others were my dearest friends and greatest teachers.","I loved all the world's mythologies.","After I saved some money, I quit work and went to a local college.","I decided that adventure was the best way to learn about writing.","It was 1943. The U.S. had already entered World War II, so I decided to join the army.","Eventually, I was sent to Wales and Germany, and after the war, to Paris.","When I was discharged, I attended the University of Paris and met a beautiful Parisian girl, Janine. We soon married and eventually returned to the States.","After seven years of writing - and working many jobs to support my family - I finally got published.","Most of my books have been written in the form of fantasy.","Using the device of an imaginary world allows me in some strange way to go to the central issues - it's one of many ways to express feelings about real people, about real human relationships.","If writers learn more from their books than do readers, perhaps I may have begun to learn.","There's this huge number of desperate people.","Writing has got to be some of the hardest work I know.","Our favorite book is always the book that speaks most directly to us at a particular stage in our lives. And our lives change. We have other favorites that give us what we most need at that particular time. But we never lose the old favorites. They're always with us. We just sort of accumulate them.","I didn't know if I'd be good with children. Actually talking with them, I mean. But I am good with them.","I'm impossible when a book is taking shape. Well, actually, I'm despicable.","Oh, my parents never cracked a book, just newspapers.","Heroes are people who think more of others than themselves. This is not to say that they don't think of themselves. They do. They certainly do. But they think of others more.","There's a kind of funny gap between 14 and 20 when young people don't read very much. Nobody really knows what to do about it, although we've tried to reach these dropout readers with the 'young adult' book.","Children's literature is as valid an art form as any other.","Talented people are finding that writing for young people is as demanding of high quality as writing for adults.","From as far back as I can remember, I always loved the King Arthur stories, fairy tales, mythology - things like that. So it was very natural for me when I came to write the 'Prydain' books to sort of follow that direction.","Classical heroes are usually much larger than life. They're not quite human beings. They're somehow larger than human scale.","King Arthur was one of my heroes because he was such a marvelous, heroic, courageous, and magnificent person that I had to admire him even though I knew perfectly well that I could never be in any way like that.","My imagination can do whatever it wants to do. This gives me a great sense of freedom.","In whatever guise - our own daily nightmares of war, intolerance, inhumanity or the struggles of an Assistant Pig-Keeper against the Lord of Death - the problems are agonizingly familiar. And an openness to compassion, love, and mercy is as essential to us here and now as it is to any inhabitant of an imaginary kingdom.","I was afraid that not even Merlin the Enchanter could transform me into a writer.","After high school, I worked as a messenger boy at a local bank. I was miserable. I felt like Robin Hood chained in the Sheriff of Nottingham's dungeon. As a would-be writer, I thought it was a catastrophe. As a bank employee, I could barely add or subtract and had to count on my fingers.","I first wrote for adults, but when I started writing for young people, it was the most creative and liberating experience of my life. I was able to express my own deepest feelings far more than I ever could when writing for adults.","I never have found out all I want to know about writing and realize I never will.","I used the imaginary kingdom not as a sentimentalized fairyland but as an opening wedge to express what I hoped would be some very hard truths.","I never saw fairy tales as an escape or a cop-out... On the contrary, speaking for myself, it is the way to understand reality.","Perhaps one reason we are fascinated by cats is because such a small animal can contain so much independence, dignity, and freedom of spirit. Unlike the dog, the cat's personality is never bet on a human's. He demands acceptance on his own terms."],"Lloyd Banks":["I take things like honor and loyalty seriously. It's more important to me than any materialistic thing or any fame I could have.","I see myself as a flashlight in the dark. I'm not trying to be overlooked anymore.","When you get money you're always a target because there's always somebody who needs money out there.","I feel like I made it already, because I got already what everybody on the corners of the neighborhood I grew up in is striving to get.","Ultimately a genuine leader is not a searcher for consensus but a molder of consensus.","We got extremely lucky. It's a tough business to work with.","You know, I feel that God isn't going to put something in front of me that I can't deal with.","I have family in Ponce. It's a shame that my grandfather passed and I wasn't able to be there with him.","A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth.","If you stay in one place, you can only rap about one thing because that's all you know.","I've seen and learned enough to keep my music fresh and spread out."],"Lloyd Bentsen":["I have never forgotten my days as an Eagle Scout. I didn't know it at the time, but what really came out of my Scouting was learning how to lead and serve the community. It has come in handy in my career in government.","Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy, I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy."],"Lloyd Blankfein":["My favourite day is like when it's raining, and I can just lie on the couch.","Ambition is your inner voice that tells you you can and should strive to go beyond your circumstances or station in life.","I remember, my first job when I got my working papers at 13 was as a vendor at Yankee Stadium - the old Yankee Stadium, with very steep stairs in the upper decks. It was all commission-based. And I think a soft drink was 25 cents, and I think you got a 10 percent or 11 percent commission.","You have to, in your own life, get people to want to work with you and want to help you. The organizational chart, in my opinion, means very little. I need my bosses' goodwill, but I need the goodwill of my subordinates even more.","Businesses will ultimately go where the markets and opportunities are.","You don't know how you'll react to things until you live through them.","I started out as a lawyer and came in laterally to Goldman Sachs. So I learned myself that life is unpredictable. That you really should, in terms of your career, try to be excellent at what you're doing. I think if you focus on your job, and you focus on being broad in the context of your job, the next jobs follow from that.","Every time I get accustomed to low volatility, like we were towards the end of the Greenspan era, and we think we have all the levers under the control... something erupts to remind us that the idea that anybody is in control of everything is hubris.","Let me tell you, there's very few places where I don't have an agenda.","I'm the chocolate chip cookie king of the world.","If you do something really well, the entire world beats a path to your door. The number three, number five, number 400 player gets nothing. It's almost a winner take all.","In my own experience, I plotted and planned my life when I was getting out of law school to know by what year I'd make it to the Supreme Court. That didn't work out the way I planned.","We certainly had an upheaval at the start of the Great Depression, and that resulted in a lot of financial reform, but it wasn't done in one stroke, and it wasn't done immediately. The Depression was in 1929 and resulted in the Securities and Exchange Act of '33, '34, '35, '37, '39, and '41.","In 2007, in the early 2007, everybody saw the housing market was falling, and at any given moment a lot of people thought it was going to fall more, and a lot of people thought it was going to rebound. You just didn't know.","Maybe bitcoin is a kind of a bubble. I don't like it. I'm not comfortable with it. I'm kind of an old dog to be absorbing that kind of a new trick.","Change is often the agent of progress in ways we can't always readily see in the early days.","There is a line in which populism can cross over into demagoguery. Demagoguery is the crossover where populism becomes a bad thing, and people make things up, and they assign responsibilities that aren't fair and justified, and scapegoat communities. And then it becomes a very bad thing.","I'd say if you wanted to forestall bad events, the best thing to do is anticipate them and try to correct them before they get close.","As CEO of a big company, I have to be a kind of a champion of the interests of our people as insofar as their ability to do their job, to feel comfortable in their work environment, and to be able to fulfill their ambitions.","Mysterious can be cool, if you're in Hollywood and everyone's happy. But it can be really bad if people perceive that the financial interests are adversarial, that there's money versus people. A lot of Goldman Sachs people went into government, so at a time when there's a distrust of institutions, some of that reflects on us.","I am one with the popular culture.","I would have liked to be a nerd. I didn't even make it to that.","You can look at history of these things, and Social Security wasn't devised to be a system that supported you for a 30-year retirement after a 25-year career... So there will be things that, you know, the retirement age has to be changed, maybe some of the benefits have to be affected, maybe some of the inflation adjustments have to be revised.","Companies that grow create wealth. This, in turn, allows people to have jobs that create more growth and more wealth. It's a virtuous cycle.","At the end of the day, it's not a normal condition to have interest rates at zero.","I don't look forward to a time when every politician, every legislator goes to Washington absolutely committed to an extreme point of view. Elected representatives are sent to Washington to compromise, not to never compromise.","The ability for employment benefits to be shared among spouses, the ability to move people who are dependent on visas for trailing spouses, all hinges on being able to deal with families of gay people in the same way that you deal with families of straight people. Otherwise, they can't move around.","With interest rates rising, gold doesn't pay an interest rate, but every other currency - it becomes not only less important to hold gold as an alternative, but more expensive to hold it as an insurance policy and so that will be a burden on the price of gold.","I got into Goldman really by acquisition because I had gone - I grew up in east New York in the Linden Projects - I did go to fancy schools, but my resume wasn't up to a Wall Street set of resumes. I went to college. I went to law school and practiced for a while.","We've had this program for a number of years now, called 10,000 Small Businesses, where Goldman Sachs has convened a group of partners to basically give business education to small business owners.","I am specifically concerned about the idea that the legislative process is one that gets characterized the way it is as the 'fiscal cliff.' At the end of the day, the United States is the biggest economy in the world, and the dollar is the reserve currency in the world. I think it behooves us to act in a much more responsible way.","My - I grew up in - I grew up in public housing. My dad, for most of my life, worked for the post office, which was a terrific job to get because you couldn't lose your job.","There's not a sport or activity in life where you have a really hard grip, you actually do better. Whether it's baseball or golf or kicking a ball, the looser you are, the further the thing goes... If you're tight, you're not necessarily better.","You can see that all these people who did really great things failed six times or didn't get going until they were much older. I think that's much more instructive and educational.","When yields on corporate bonds are lower than dividends on stocks, that unnerves me.","I read a lot of history, and I know that once upon a time, a coin was worth $5 if it had $5 worth of gold in it. Now we have paper that is just backed by fiat... Maybe in the new world, something gets backed by consensus.","I've learned over the years that there's a lot of things that work out pretty well that I don't love.","In markets, there are times when you are looking for what makes sense. At other times, you are looking for what you can do that is sensible versus constraints and uncertainties.","Growth requires risk-taking. If you want to dampen risk and make sure you never have a problem, you do so, but that also will have an effect on growth. This is a decision that doesn't necessarily belong to financial institutions. It belongs to regulators and legislators who represent the body politic.","There is a tradition in America of people in business not only commenting on the way the government is being run but doing something about it if they don't like it. In fact, they don't just rail about it: they go into government, like some of my ex-colleagues.","The U.S. is not pure capitalism. In fact, there's no place for pure capitalism, unregulated capitalism. We have a regulated system.","I always thought that a prep school was what some people went to after high school to prepare themselves for college.","To the extent I bloomed, I'm a late bloomer.","The best traders are not right more than they are wrong. They are quick adjusters. They are better at getting right when they are wrong.","I always had a lot of confidence in my ability to gauge a situation and people and try to understand them and what they were saying and what their context was.","If you can't legislate, you can't deal with problems.","Too much of the GDP over the last generation has gone to too few of the people.","It's very hard to go out and make big investments to take advantage of the shale energy if we don't know if it's always going to be there, what price it's going to be there, whether the country's going to allow it to be exported, or whether it's going to go and affect subsidized U.S. manufacturing.","If you had asked me, did I have everything nailed down and wired about what I wanted to do, and was I following some real plan? No. In fact, by the time I was in my mid-20s or even late-20s, and I was still in the law firm, I really was starting to get a little nervous that I didn't know what I was going to do.","All you can do is the best you can do.","I never thought I would tweet - I thought it was too dangerous.","The list of things that are conventional today that I use every day that I thought would never make it is a very long list.","No one at Goldman Sachs gets paid out of his or her own P&L. It matters how your business is doing, but it matters more how the firm as a whole is doing."],"Lloyd Bridges":["There's a lot to be said about what's happening to our ocean, big companies polluting it with their oil and all the raw garbage that's being spilled in there.","As time went on, I got envious and wanted to do a lot of stunts myself.","Bear Valley is the hidden treasure of the Sierra.","Carrying those double tanks around all the time got to be a little rough on me. I had to put that damn wetsuit on and take it off, sometimes three or four times a day.","For four years doing that same character all the time kind of bothered me. Butit opened up a lot of doors.","I needed to feed my family. I read a couple of the episodes. How can you keep on doing the same thing?","I'm foremost an actor. I feel embarrassed being compared to the guys who really work at it. I fake it, I make believe I know all about it, which is what you're supposed to do as an actor.","Sea Hunt was the first time anyone tackled a show that took place underwater. The stories were sort of exciting for kids, like cops and robbers underwater.","We wanted to set a good example for the growing number of divers watching.","We worked under a lot of pressure... three days to do an episode, sometimes two in a week, 39 episodes a year."],"Lloyd Cutler":["Later in that administration, I was asked to take a job which I had to turn down as Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs because we were just then putting together the merger of two small law firms that became this law firm. I couldn't leave them at that point.","Certainly the existence of these huge nuclear force was important for the ultimate confrontation, let's say, over western Europe. You just can't use them to deal with a situation like Afghanistan.","The whole thing was done for internal political reasons to galvanize and unify the country against the Americans, and if they hadn't had that immediate opportunity they would have found another one.","In the end, the Foreign Ministry had no power at all to do anything.","And we made decisions on each of those matters which were ultimately upheld by the courts.","I learned running the government for the Presidency, which I always thought was difficult, is even more difficult than I thought.","I think the President himself is a remarkably intelligent, decent, ethical man. I think he did very well, but I think the job builds up over expectations which all candidates contribute to including this President that simply cannot be fulfilled."],"Lloyd Doggett":["Sometimes when you get in a fight with a skunk, you can't tell who started it.","Save the stonewall to build the levees.","Well, dissent is the tradition in America, and I've been on the side of dissent a good bit of my career, particularly in the last many years of the Republican Congress."],"Lloyd Dorfman":["India offers exciting business opportunities owing to the growth in corporate travel and a significant middle-class population waiting to explore the world. To begin with, Travelex is setting up eight city centre branches in metros and other major cities including tourist destinations.","I don't play golf, and I'm not into horse racing.","Money is a very fundamental ingredient in anyone starting up a new business.","People travel because it's a treat. For me, staying at home is a treat.","I do have a fundamental concern about us losing control of our own destiny, and this is not just about the euro. You can expand and extend it into the whole constitutional issue. The British people have been suckered with regard to how the whole currency and constitutional issues have been sold to them.","By all means, let's have free trade and no trade barriers and a common market. But where did it all suddenly become about our own economic and political destiny being surrendered to Brussels with agendas that arguably have very little to do with the interests of the British people and British voters?","If you are going to think the same as everyone else and do the same as everyone else, you will end up being the same as everyone else. In today's competitive environment you have to think a bit differently.","I have no interest in owning a football club; I don't play golf; I don't like horseracing and I'd rather become a professional bungee jumper than enter politics.","Am I a frustrated performer? My wife would say I am! I guess there has to be something of the performer in you if you build a global business.","The key thing for me is to secure medium-term funding for the Roundhouse studios. It costs around £2m a year to run, but we want to grow it, and of course that will cost more.","I'm a really boring bloke, actually. My business is my hobby.","We are quite a way off before people travel around the world without cash in their pockets. The growth of plastic and electronic transactions have tended to impact traveller's cheques rather than cash.","With Indian migrants all over the world, money transfer is a big business in India.","Travelex has grown into a global business in just 25 years. The acquisition of Thomas Cook's Global & Financial Services has created a business that would have had a combined turnover of U.S. $28.4 billion in 2000.","For centuries, the arts and philanthropists have worked well together: look at the Tate family and the Courtaulds. If you've been fortunate enough to have some success in business, I think it's important to put something back.","In the old days we were the challenger brand competing against the big banks, but today I go round the world and I sit with governors of central banks and finance ministers and, in some cases, prime ministers. They all know Travelex. We are regarded as the establishment - the world's largest retailer of foreign currency.","I think as a business it would be amazing if the euro was to collapse, but financially and economically I think that would be a bit of a tsunami for everybody to cope with.","I believe the combination of Travelex and Apax will represent a powerful force.","In 2003, Travelex acquired Thomas Cook Financial Services. We only had use of the Thomas Cook name for five years, so I had to increase public awareness of Travelex to migrate all Cook operations over to it. It was a success.","Individual and corporate support is vital to building on London's leadership in the arts, and I hope others will join me in wanting to build on the National's role at the heart of modern theatre and sustaining it long into the future.","My mind tends to operate a bit like a radar. I don't find it hard to switch off.","I've always loved and enjoyed the theatre, but I have to say that none of our sponsorships have been done because I'm one of those chairmen and chief executives who goes gooey-eyed about something. They are done for a very specific marketing and commercial agenda.","If you've been fortunate enough to have some success in business, I think it's important to put something back.","The idea of going into the property business and collecting rent four times a year and waiting for five-year rent reviews has limited appeal.","When I started the business, only banks operated at airports, only banks issued travellers' cheques, only banks issued international payments, only banks serviced their own branch networks.","At school, I would read the City pages before I read the sports pages."],"Lloyd Kaufman":["I believe that independent film making is the last frontier of creative expression available. So I'm always willing to lend a helping hand to a young film maker who's just getting into the business.","Movies are art and the spirit of the movie depends on the creators.","In our racist, sexist society, Christmas is the 8 hours when we stop killing each other and gratutious over eating is encouraged so that the starving and other people in the world can die!","I like fat people more then I like thin people, things are always a lot more funnier when they happen to fat people.","It is up to us to produce better-quality movies.","There is no way I could have ever dared to make a documentary, much less have the money to make a documentary, if it was on 16mm. But, with the magic of digital.","If someone offered me a hundred million dollars to make a movie? I would first remind him that there are 850 million people in the world who don't have enough to eat.","I'm from the '60s, but no one has ever accused me of being a hippie. I never had much interest in the Woodstock crowd, which partied to change the world, while real people were starving to death in Africa.","I don't make crappy movies. I spend two or three years making a film. I don't take myself seriously, but I take my movies very seriously.","The thing I find about the movie industry is that 99 percent of the people are absolute scum. They're horrible people, they really are. Very nasty killer rabbits who hate movies. But the other 1 percent are really the greatest, most wonderful people in the world.","In our racist, sexist society, Christmas is the eight hours when we stop killing each other and gratuitous overeating is encouraged so that the starving and other people in the world can die!","'Fast Food Nation' was boring and aimed at yuppies, and yuppies don't eat fast food.","That DMC Act is a disgrace. And the problem with independent art in this country is that independent artists have been economically blacklisted.","The dean of the American Film Institute has written that I'm one of the very few auteurs in America. I've had freedom for 40 years to create art that is totally personal and is what I believe in.","I majored in Chinese Studies. I'm probably the only director of chicken Indian zombie movies who can speak pretty good Mandarin.","Comedy is not commercial; it is risky, because what is funny in one place isn't always funny somewhere else.","My roommate at Yale University introduced me to the auteur theory of filmmaking. I soon became a big fan of the works of John Ford, Kenji Mizoguchi, Ernst Lubitsch, and Stan Brakhage. I then decided to make my own films!","My favorite film is always the one that I most recently worked on.","I hope that all new filmmakers see that the Internet and social media are helpful tools in establishing a fan base as well as being able to interact with your fans."],"Lloyd Shapley":["Now, I'm ahead of my father. He got other prizes... But he did not get a Nobel Prize.","I'm a mathematician and always have been, as far as I can remember. I don't remember when I first got involved with mathematics, but I think of myself always as a mathematician first.","I never, never in my life took a course in economics."],"Lloyd Waner":["Our sister Alma was the best hitter in the family. We used to soak corn cobs in water so they wouldn't fly so far when we hit 'em. Alma was the first to hit one far enough to break a window in the barn.","I just loved to play. I liked to study the other ballplayers. I could talk about it for ages, because I played professional ball for 20 years, and I was still learning when I quit.","When I played, a pitcher could throw at you any time he wanted to. In fact, he could tell you he was going to throw at you, and there was nothing said. You had to take it. If he hit ya, he hit ya."],"Lobsang Tenzin":["Communication will bring understanding and understanding will cause harmonious mutual relationships which can establish peace and stability.","Lack of understanding of interrelatedness has caused numerous divisions and conflicts that are the cause of many major challenges in the world such as war, violence, terrorism, economic disparity, and exploitation.","To learn means by practice, by inquiring, by analyzing to find out what is, not what was.","If you are able to see the interrelatedness of mind and body, sensitivity towards your body becomes much sharper. Therefore, maintaining of good health also becomes easier.","Everyone needs an open mind and an accepting heart. With a combination of these two aspects, you will be able to communicate sensibly.","You need not search for the compassionate mind from outside. To know yourself, to know your nature, your mind will automatically be the compassionate one.","Training and education is one and the same: that is, to train the mind through a discipline in order to awake the inner intelligence of the individuals.","Do not lose your independent mind, unconditioned mind. You have by nature a very powerful mind. You can find everything for yourself; you can know everything for yourself.","I do not think any religion encourages intolerance. Intolerance is the biggest mental defilement, and every religion tries to remove this defilement. So we must understand that whenever there is intolerance, this comes from an irreligious mind. It is not created by religion, and it is not in the mind of the religious person.","We shall have to practise to lead our life on the basis of our needs, not under the influence of our greed.","No one can avoid death; it is inevitable. Therefore, I should create in my mind a kind of willingness and accepting for that event without any fear.","In the Buddhist learning process, we say three stages. The first is hearing, the second is contemplation, and the third is meditation.","Every religion or every philosophy is an outcome of the human search for liberation.","For a person who is very much involved with the institution of religion but has lost the religious spirit, the 'religion' label is the real threat to liberty.","A religion must be instrumental in spiritualising the individual into a boundless and holistic nature.","Faith and reason overpower each other throughout one's life, which results in contradiction, but the conflict never ceases in any sphere.","The line of demarcation between history and legend is too thin to observe while writing; the two overlap each other unconsciously and unknowingly.","Today, education does not give you the wisdom and the understanding; it only indoctrinates you to believe something. So the mind knows very less but accepts so many things; it may be science, it may be technology, it may be anything.","Non-violence is the essence of the entire Buddha's teaching, and the practice of non-violence is the entire essence of the practice of Buddha dharma, Buddhist spirituality, in one's life.","People forget who they are; they always remain with an identity which is not the real self. It is just a projected self which does not exist, but they identify with this projected self appearance.","Interreligious dialogue is extremely important for religious people as well as secular people or non-believers. They should participate, and they should be encouraged to have interreligious dialogue, because dialogue is a channel or an instrument to promote intimacy between individual.","We can never protect the rights by only thinking about our rights. By performing the universal responsibility with a compassionate mind, you can protect your own right and that of others.","For the exploitation of human greed, they have devised comparison and competition. Right from childhood on, we are indoctrinated to compare and compete, and there is a word, a phrase: 'free and fair competition.'","In ancient times, we were users; we used the commodities in accordance to our needs. Using is not sufficient for the modern market; it needs consumers. Consuming means consuming things much more than the natural need of humanity or of any living being.","Dying peacefully means to avoid any immediate cause for anger, fear, or strong desire.","Bodily discomfort and emotional fear and attachment make the dying uncomfortable and fearful. So, to help those dying people, I think modern medical science has a lot of facilities to reduce pain, or perhaps not to reduce pain, but not to experience pain.","A compassionate mind is very difficult to cultivate because compassion demands a sense of equality between all living beings.","To seek advice is easy, easy-approach job. To find the truth by yourself, that is a little difficult, and you have to work hard continuously, and you will find it.","Because all the thought processes are limited, they are conditioned, and the thought does not touch directly with the reality, the truth; thoughts only grasps at the image of the truth."],"Logan Browning":["I don't want people to know how I am feeling because it makes you more vulnerable.","Every morning, when I'm really, really tired... when I'm dead tired is when I feel most alive."],"Logan Green":["I think we've built a bit of a culture and a market around people who are open and seek out that social interaction.","I start every day reviewing priorities, prepping for meetings, and getting updated on key projects.","I really admire Airbnb as a pioneer of the sharing economy and for building community. They've found an elegant way to help hosts make more money and for guests to have authentic experiences. It brings those people together in a unique way.","When people want transportation, they want it now.","The company culture is about being human, being good to other people. We recently did a survey with our drivers. 48 out of 50 said that they preferred driving with Lyft because they said that passengers were friendlier.","Mobile forced us to rethink the user experience and do something people would be able to carry out on in a couple of seconds on the mobile phone. By stripping out all the work the user used to do and putting that on the company, we were able to create a much better user experience.","Our goal was never to create a better taxi.","Our goal was to completely change transportation. Change traffic. And make it possible to get anywhere you want to go without owning a car.","From the way that we build cars or going after space travel, I get excited about the transportation space because it's the second-highest household expense after housing.","I've always been fascinated with how transportation systems work and how cities are designed.","A lot of the other companies in the space have really left a bad taste in regulators' mouths. It's actually been a huge advantage when we come in and we take the time to sit down and get to know them, explain the business, explain what we do.","We're building the ultimate experience for fun, flexibility, and empowerment where you can rent a car, fill it with discounted gas, meet new people, stop for a Starbucks coffee, and have your earnings deposited into your bank account all in the same day.","I grew up in L.A., and it's one of those cities designed around cars instead of the people that live there. I spent hours every day stuck in traffic, having the experience of looking around and seeing one person in every car.","When I went to the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2002, I decided I wanted to leave my car at home and create an experiment with my own life. I'd only be able to find creative solutions to transportation if I felt the pain of trying to get to downtown at 10 o'clock at night.","In March 2005, I was appointed to the board of the Santa Barbara metro transit district. I was incredibly optimistic about how public transportation can be the solution to help people live in the city and not need a car.","I typically work out 20-30 minutes every morning to get the day started.","To get to the office every day, I either take a Lyft or have my wife drop me off. It's about a 15-minute drive from my house to the office.","I try to block a couple of hours of unscheduled time every day so that I can work on the day's most important projects.","Lyft came out of a hackathon project where we were trying to figure out what does Zimride look like on mobile.","With Lyft Line, we are matching two or more passengers who are heading the same way. That's how we're going deeper and are able to provide transportation for different kinds of trips.","Most of the population cannot afford a private driver. What we're doing is relentlessly innovating to bring the price point down.","Almost every ride we're profitable on. We make money on every ride.","When you're starting a company, almost anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and it will probably look like and feel like you made the absolute wrong decision to start the company. If you're not absolutely determined to solve a problem or see something through, it might not make sense to keep going.","We want Lyft to meet your needs, whether going out to a nice date or event and want a nicer car, or if you're just trying to get to work every day and need something affordable.","We're learning a lot from large international competitors... As we go international, we're looking to add something unique to the market. And so when we do go international, it won't just be as a taxi service.","I think Uber is a good car service, but Lyft is going after a much bigger problem in trying to make life without a car possible and reinvent the way people get around cities.","Uber is a good car service, and that's exactly what they were when we launched.","If we want every car on the road to be a Lyft, we need to make it incredibly convenient for drivers.","In L.A., it's the sort of city where you have to have a car to get around.","Particularly when it comes to the regulatory environment, being a jerk doesn't actually get you very far.","When you are talking about transportation, people aren't making their plans while in front of a computer.","There's a misconception that Lyft is just a better version of the taxi. You know, I think that's just scratching the surface of what we're doing.","Every mom in a minivan, every person commuting - anytime they are on the road, they should be able to go into driver mode and give a ride to a neighbor. That's how we achieve scale.","Our vision for the world is making car ownership unnecessary.","People crave community, more efficient living, and easier access to the places they want to go.","The Millennial Generation - the biggest American generation in history - is reversing the migration into rural areas and moving back to city centers.","We created Lyft because we want to establish a radically different concept of personal transportation. We want people to think of transportation as a service enabled by technology instead of as an expensive and large piece of hardware to own.","On-demand ridesharing can make cities less congested and polluted and free up resources. Shared rides can become so affordable that they cost the same as a bus ride today.","Every transportation department at schools thought that there should be a bike buddy program. They thought that bicycle commuters wanted to find another buddy to bike with to campus, which is a nice idea. But the consumer demand for that was about zero.","Lyft Line is our biggest step in bringing down prices... We've been thinking about this ever since we launched Lyft. We always intended to do it.","We refer to Lyft as a 'mullet app.' Simple up front, a lot going on in the back."],"Logan Henderson":["I love a girl with a sense of humor. Someone who can make me laugh and that I can get along with and talk with and who is just sweet overall, inside and out.","Flying is like the ultimate superpower; it's just, like, the coolest thing.","I was always a class clown, so I never had trouble fitting in; I just had trouble finding out where I really wanted to be.","I don't really get nervous, ever. I just have a good time.","The stage for our whole show is actually really interesting and a lot of fun. There's always something going on so we figure even the people who come up and don't know Big Time Rush love the show because there's always something going on, so that's what we love about it.","My whole family is really tight-knit. We're a really good team.","I like Katy Perry. I mean, what is there not to like?! She's crazy, she's fun and she has some crazy pipes on her. She can sing.","I think a little bit of competition is always good.","Just date people you like, then you're guaranteed to have fun."],"Logan Lerman":["Growing up, I had a very normal relationship with my brother and sister. But, over time, they became my best friends, and now I hang out with them all the time. I'm very close with them.","I want to be a good actor more than anything - someone you can respect.","I'm just trying to find a good project. Work with a good director, someone I really admire. Find a good role.","I'd say people that really inspired me at first were like, Dustin Hoffman, Jim Carrey... serious Jim Carrey though.","For me, being able to be vulnerable is difficult, but it's just something that I feel comfortable doing. I need to fully understand why, the thought-process behind the character and I have to believe it. That comes from a lot of preparation.","I appreciate film actors who respect the film making process.","I just love being in the U.K.","Berlin is my favourite city.","I got into acting to get my foot in the door for film-making.","There really isn't a dream role, but there's a dream situation where I could work with a director that I idolize. So, the idea of working with David Fincher or Paul Thomas Anderson or Wes Anderson or Scorsese or Spielberg or any of the guys I really idolize is a dream for me.","I'm doing 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower'... It was a book I read when I was younger, and it just changed my life, and I just wanted to be a part of it.","I did a commercial when I was, like, 5 or 6 years old for... what was it called?... Cabbage Patch Kids! That was the first thing I ever did. Little bit embarrassing.","When I was five I thought auditions were a great way to get out of school!","I grew up going to school and high school and then shooting a movie for a few months. It's an odd way to grow up and is kind of forced maturity.","The idea of working with David Fincher or Paul Thomas Anderson or Wes Anderson or Scorsese or Spielberg or any of the guys I really idolize is a dream for me.","I've definitely had the experience where I was pursuing someone for a long time that I just obviously did not connect with, so I was always, kind of altering myself for her, But then you realize it's just not worth it. What's the point?","When I'm back at home it's just reality. I kind of separate myself from Hollywood.","'The Goonies' is classic. That's, like, the movie I bring with me if I go out of town for a long time, because it just makes me think of the best times I've seen it with my friends growing up. Dude, everybody knows that movie, everybody watches that film. Best family film ever made.","I just want to make sure I'm contributing good films to movie history rather than being famous just to be famous.","I'm always in the theater seeing everything, good or bad.","I love movie sets. It's another home for me. Movie theaters and movie sets - they're just the best places to be. I love them.","I don't get the jitters and I don't get nervous, because I build that comfort on set for myself. Sometimes if I'm gonna do something really crazy, it helps me to yell or look like an idiot on set, so that when I'm about to do a scene, I've already embarrassed myself. I find ways to work around getting the jitters.","I don't really look around and say, 'I've made it.' I just look around and think how fortunate I am to work with the people I'm working with.","My whole family is in orthotics and prosthetics, so I grew up having to check for scoliosis every week. 'Come over. Let me feel your spine.'","I really started acting when I was 12 when I was doing this television show called 'Jack & Bobby.'"],"Logan Mankins":["You might not feel good, and you might not want to practice, but you still go out there and practice as hard as you can.","I always felt like we were here to do a job, so you should be out there practicing and playing.","I hurt my left knee playing left tackle. I had surgery on my right knee.","If you could still run and play, there's no reason to go see a doctor, right?","If I can run, I'm not going to sit out any game. I'm here to play football, not to watch and collect a check.","The best thing I've ever heard another player say is, 'I hate playing against you.'","I'm not going to say something I shouldn't. In that way, I was probably the perfect guy to play in New England.","I have a good house for hosting, so we had the barbecues, and some of the guys over for Thanksgiving, even Christmas.","Growing up, I was taught a man's word is his bond.","Once you've been around this business long enough, anything is a possibility. It's a business first and foremost. Guys play it because they love it, but it is a business, and if you don't understand that it's a business, you're lying to yourself.","It's a place I'll always remember, and I have nothing bad to say about New England. I love that place.","I might be in a little decline. I don't know. How many guys that have played 150 games are still on the upswing? I've played a lot of games, a lot of snaps.","When someone invests in you, I don't want to disappoint them. I want to be the player they think they're getting.","It's always great when you just pound the rock, impose your will, and that is going to break the spirit of the defense if you can keep running it and they can't stop you.","You don't have time to dwell on what is going on in the games.","I just want to play until I think I don't feel good - and if I can still do it. If I can't do it, I don't think I'll keep going once I don't feel I'm playing the way I want to.","I understand what training camp is for. It's needed. It's necessary, so it's just one of those things that you have to put yourself through and it makes you better. It gets you in good shape, so it's necessary.","In football, you're hitting, so you might as well hit in practice.","I like to keep most of my private life private.","I always was flattered when people would say I would do whatever it took for the team. I always thought of myself as that kind of guy.","You always feel pretty good after a bye, after a couple of days off. Not having a game, you freshen up a little."],"Logan Marshall-Green":["I just always wanted to be a baseball announcer. I'm a huge Mets fan, and I wanted to be the next Bob Murphy. As far as careers go, that was the first career that I really thought about. Well, before that, I wanted to be a Mello Yello truck driver.","When your father directed your mother in 'Orpheus Descending,' the kid's going to be a theater nerd.","I just think the more we're observed by other people, the less we can observe them in order to play them and find their true condition.","My mom introduced me to science-fiction.","When I was told that I was being offered a role in 'Miss Julie,' I already knew I wanted to do it.","My intention of making acting a career was about being onstage.","I don't need to be liked, but I need to be vital - on set or on stage - and I think that probably would be my advice: Stay vital. It's about saying 'no' and asking the tough questions and believing in yourself when no one else will, but you have to know the rules to break them.","Being vital means knowing the rules and being brave enough to break them.","My first real acting gig was probably playing Mamillius in my mother's 'Winter's Tale.' My mom and dad are both in theater, so I grew up acting and being a little theater brat as well.","If I was discovered by anyone, it would be Stephen O'Neil, who saw me in a play at Williamstown and introduced me to my team who I'm still with today. He was the first person to introduce me to the film and TV world. Other than that, I just assumed I would be a theater actor my whole life.","I'm not responsible enough to have puppies.","It takes awhile for writers to get to know actors rhythms, not just as actors, but what they bring to the characters. I think it takes a few episodes for the writing room to catch up to the actors and vice versa.","I'd be honored to be in the same sentence as Tom Hardy. I've been a twin since the day I was born - fraternal, but we look a lot alike - so I've already been mixed up with another man my entire life."],"Logan Pearsall Smith":["If you want to be thought a liar, always tell the truth.","Happiness is a wine of the rarest vintage, and seems insipid to a vulgar taste.","How it infuriates a bigot, when he is forced to drag out his dark convictions!","What is more mortifying than to feel that you have missed the plum for want of courage to shake the tree?","Hearts that are delicate and kind and tongues that are neither - these make the finest company in the world.","It is through the cracks in our brains that ecstasy creeps in.","Don't laugh at a youth for his affectations; he is only trying on one face after another to find a face of his own.","It is the wretchedness of being rich that you have to live with rich people.","It takes a great man to give sound advice tactfully, but a greater to accept it graciously.","How can they say my life is not a success? Have I not for more than sixty years got enough to eat and escaped being eaten?","People say that life is the thing, but I prefer reading.","There is more felicity on the far side of baldness than young men can possibly imagine.","If you are losing your leisure, look out; you may be losing your soul.","What I like in a good author is not what he says but what he whispers.","The old know what they want; the young are sad and bewildered.","Our names are labels, plainly printed on the bottled essence of our past behavior.","The mere process of growing old together will make our slightest acquaintances seem like bosom friends.","What's more enchanting than the voices of young people, when you can't hear what they say?","We need two kinds of acquaintances, one to complain to, while to the others we boast.","Only a generation of readers will span a generation of writers.","The test of a vocation is the love of the drudgery it involves.","There are few sorrows, however poignant, in which a good income is of no avail.","All my life, as down an abyss without a bottom. I have been pouring van loads of information into that vacancy of oblivion I call my mind.","The vitality of a new movement in Art must be gauged by the fury it arouses.","Most people sell their souls, and live with a good conscience on the proceeds.","A slight touch of friendly malice and amusement towards those we love keeps our affections for them from turning flat.","Only among people who think no evil can Evil monstrously flourish.","There are two things to aim at in life: first, to get what you want, and after that to enjoy it. Only the wisest of mankind achieve the second.","The denunciation of the young is a necessary part of the hygiene of older people, and greatly assists the circulation of the blood.","To suppose as we all suppose, that we could be rich and not behave as the rich behave, is like supposing that we could drink all day and stay sober.","Those who set out to serve both God and Mammon soon discover that there is no God.","The newest books are those that never grow old.","Charming people live up to the very edge of their charm, and behave as outrageously as the world lets them.","People before the public live an imagined life in the thought of others, and flourish or feel faint as their self outside themselves grows bright or dwindles in that mirror.","Solvency is entirely a matter of temperament and not of income.","Every author, however modest, keeps a most outrageous vanity chained like a madman in the padded cell of his breast.","Thank Heaven, the sun has gone in, and I don't have to go out and enjoy it.","When they come downstairs from their Ivory Towers, idealists are very apt to walk straight into the gutter.","A best-seller is the gilded tomb of a mediocre talent.","What joy can the years bring half so sweet as the unhappiness they've taken away?","There are people who, like houses, are beautiful in dilapidation.","I can't forgive my friends for dying; I don't find these vanishing acts of theirs at all amusing.","Don't let young people tell you their aspirations; when they drop them they will drop you.","Those who set out to serve both God and Mammon soon discover that there isn't a God.","There is one thing that matters, to set a chime of words tinkling in the minds of a few fastidious people.","Many of our daydreams would darken into nightmares, were there a danger of their coming true!","We grow with years more fragile in body, but morally stouter, and can throw off the chill of a bad conscience almost at once.","He who goes against the fashion is himself its slave.","The notion of making money by popular work, and then retiring to do good work, is the most familiar of all the devil's traps for artists."],"Lois Capps":["The refusal to acknowledge the scientific value of embryonic stem cell research is one more tragic misstep.","Drilling in the refuge will not solve America's energy problem.

We know that they serve as our first lines of communication when something goes wrong or when we are concerned about health.","And as a nurse, I know very well the importance, for example, of electronic medical records.","Unfortunately, we are still in an age where individuals may be discriminated against because of health conditions.","In reality drilling is the slowest, dirtiest, and most expensive way to solve our energy crisis.","It is time for a New Direction for our nation's energy policies.","I will continue to work in Washington to oppose any efforts to expand drilling off our Coasts and to challenge my colleagues to adopt responsible energy policies.","Each year thousands of embryos, no bigger than the head of a pin, are created in the process of in vitro fertilization, with the support of Congress, by the way.","National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month is celebrated each May, and becomes a chance for our Nation to become more familiar with the effects of this disease, and about the preventable steps that we can take to deal with it.","Research clearly shows us that the earlier women think about maintaining their bone mass and take the steps to do so, the better their health will be in the long run.","We have a moral responsibility to save wild places like the arctic refuge for future generations, and that is why our country has remained committed to its protection for nearly 50 years.","With 3 percent of the world's resources and 25 percent of the world's demand, it is pretty obvious this country cannot drill its way to energy security.","Let there be no mistake, Hamas is a ruthless terrorist organization.","I simply cannot see how denying chemotherapy treatment for Palestinian children increases Israel's security or advances U.S. national interests.","In addition, for almost a year now I have been urging the President, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate suspicious gas price spikes.","Studies have indicated there is a strong correlation between the shortages of nurses and morbidity and mortality rates in our hospitals.","I want to thank the efforts of the American Public Health Association and its 200-plus partners who have organized events around the Nation that serve to raise everyone's awareness of the need to improve public health.","In America today, the percentage of children and adolescents who are defined as overweight is more than double what it was in the early 1970s.","My experience as a school nurse taught me that we need to make a concerted effort, all of us, to increase physical fitness activity among our children and to encourage all Americans to adopt a healthier diet that includes fruits and vegetables, but there is more."],"Lois Chiles":["I grew up in Alice, Texas, a small oil town with one theater that only showed Roy Rogers movies.

You cannot put Florida in the same category as California or New York.","A strong, unwavering relationship between the U.S. and its allies Japan and South Korea is necessary for the national and economic security of all three countries.","A North Korea that has the capability to use a nuclear weapon that can reach an American city or those of an ally poses a grave challenge as the U.S. seeks to preserve peace and stability in the region.","I really do believe in succession building and giving people experience for future leadership.","I've taken legislation that people have been trying to pass for 10 or 15 years, and I got it passed.","Veterans have stood up for us.","Veterans are one area where Republicans and Democrats have made progress together.","Why give Russia or Syria any reason to doubt that Obama would use force?","I can say this very clearly: I have come into this Congress with an antiwar bias.","I do not want to send anybody else's child to war.","All polling places should be safe, without discrimination against any religion.","I think the Port of Palm Beach has an opportunity to thrive, if they can figure out how to do it with community support.","A lone voice isn't as important as a collective voice.","There should be no room in our society for any type of religious bigotry.","Once you've been a mayor, you look to try to get things done.","Mayors, I think, tend to be more no-nonsense, and you look for economic opportunities for your communities.","Yachts are job creators.","My concept of hitting the ground running and being an effective legislator is to focus on my district and having really good constituent work.","There's always been incivility in politics.","I don't particularly care to know the names of the people in the Freedom Caucus.","I'm the mother of a Marine veteran.","Sometimes less is better with government.","I am not one of those who thinks that Congress needs to be in session 24 hours a day interfering in peoples' lives.","Issues become much more real to me when I have stories back home.","We are a nation of laws, and we should live by the rule of law. And sometimes we should have a little bit of common sense.","I have been in office for many years, and let me tell you, many times I have hated what the press has said about me.","It's very interesting how Washington works. It's not about speeches. It's about relationships.","The reason Jeb Bush is not doing well is because of his name. He is part of a long establishment Republican family, and this is not going well with the Republican Party.","ISIL is dangerous. They're a threat. They're a brutal, horrible force that needs to be dealt with.","We are held up by the radical Muslims as the enemy. So every time we go into one of these countries to do - we think - the right thing, we become propaganda for this radical movement.","I am fairly certain that our budget deficit was not caused by children with autism or 90-year-old grannies in nursing homes, so why take it out on them by cutting services?","We have required under law for years that men and women get paid equal money for equal work. But we've faced challenges enforcing that law. There is still a large wage gap, and there are numerous instances of women holding jobs where they are not compensated fairly.","We must engage with China to try and put as much pressure on North Korea as possible.","I always tell people that being the mayor of an urban city for eight years was like getting run over by a truck every day. There's inner satisfaction, but 24 hours a day, every day, I'm on duty.","I served 14 years in the state legislature and served in both the minority and majority.","I have learned how to take votes where I had to hold my nose because I had to compromise - something that you learn to do, especially when you have been in the minority.","My son was born right here in Florida; he went to public schools and went to the University of Florida and surprised me - I'll tell you that - when he went into the service.","When I was a young kid, girls were taught that their role in life was to get married and have children. It was the 1950s. Those were the rules.","I think I have a gene in me to always fight for the underdog, which I've done since I was a kid.","I never liked the status quo. Once I went to college, I got very involved in student activism.","I ran for Congress in 1992, but I lost the election, and I really dropped the idea of ever serving in Congress. Eventually, I went home and became the mayor of my city, West Palm Beach. I was mayor for eight years."],"Lois Greenfield":["My interest in photography is not to capture an image I see or even have in my mind, but to explore the potential of moments I can only begin to imagine.","My inspiration has always been photography's ability to stop time and reveal what the naked eye cannot see.","The ostensible subject of my photographs may be motion, but the subtext is time. A dancer's movements illustrate the passage of time, giving it a substance, materiality, and space. In my photographs, time is stopped, a split second becomes an eternity, and an ephemeral moment is solid as sculpture.","I don't digitally manipulate my images, because I am interested in the spontaneous act of creating images without forethought. I know many artists start with an idea in mind, and then they put it on paper. I don't work that way.","Being called a dance photographer makes me bristle. You might say that dance is my landscape. The root of my interest is movement or, rather, how movement can be interpreted photographically, and dance provides a perfect opportunity for this.","What intrigues me is making images that confound and confuse the viewer but that the viewer knows, or suspects, really happened.","I shoot just one moment at a time... These moments are beneath the threshold of perception.","If I knew what the photograph was going to look like, I wouldn't bother taking it. It's the voyage of discovery that fascinates me.","Working improvisationally in my studio with dancers, it's completely different. We don't have any starting point; we don't have an end point. We don't have anything we are trying to show or do. The picture evolves from nowhere.","I realized that one of the differences between news photography and dance photography was that the former has to tell a specific story, whereas all a dance photograph had to be was visually interesting."],"Lois Lerner":["I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations and I have not provided false information to this or any other committee."],"Lois Lowry":["I've always been fascinated by memory and dreams because they are both completely our own. No one else has the same memories. No one has the same dreams.","When I wrote 'The Giver,' it contained no so-called 'bad words.' It was set, after all, in a mythical, futuristic, and Utopian society. Not only was there no poverty, divorce, racism, sexism, pollution, or violence in the world of 'The Giver'; there was also careful attention paid to language: to its fluency, precision, and power.","Submitting to censorship is to enter the seductive world of 'The Giver': the world where there are no bad words and no bad deeds. But it is also the world where choice has been taken away and reality distorted. And that is the most dangerous world of all.","I think teens are drawn to these speculative books that portray what might happen and what could happen.","In 1952, when I was 15 and living on Governors Island, which was then First Army Headquarters, I encountered the newly-published 'The Catcher in the Rye.' Of course, that book became the iconic anti-establishment novel for my generation.","When you lose a child in an accident as I did, it's final - you're not caught in this longing for him, to search for him, knowing he's out there some place.","Kids deserve the right to think that they can change the world.","I often compare myself as a kid to my own grandchildren, who are around 11 and 14 now. That's the age kids usually read my book. And I remember myself; we'd gone through a world war. My father was an army officer so I was aware of what was going on. But I wasn't bombarded with images of catastrophe like many kids are today.","People do things that turn out badly, often for the most benevolent of reasons.","So many of my books, I don't want to say they have messages, but they have important things to say.","Early on I came to realize something, and it came from the mail I received from kids. That is, kids at that pivotal age, 12, 13 or 14, they're still deeply affected by what they read, some are changed by what they read, books can change the way they feel about the world in general. I don't think that's true of adults as much.","I've always been interested in medicine and was pleased when my brother became a doctor. But after thinking seriously about that field, I realized that what intrigued me was not the science, not the chemistry or biology of medicine, but the narrative - the story of each patient, each illness.","I believe without a single shadow of a doubt that it is necessary for young people to learn to make choices. Learning to make right choices is the only way they will survive in an increasingly frightening world.","People can lie in letters, but they tend not to. They certainly lie in memoirs.","I turn to books for a feeling of companionship: for somebody knowing what I have known.","It's interesting that so many books now are published as the first in a series. It never occurred to me. Although 'The Giver' does have an ambiguous ending. I've heard about that from readers over the years.","In my writing, I focus lenses. I'm almost always seeing when I am writing.","Pretending that there are no choices to be made - reading only books, for example, which are cheery and safe and nice - is a prescription for disaster for the young.","I was a sidelines child: never class president, never team captain, never the one with the most valentines in my box.","Often in the past, there have been authors that were deeply disappointed in their adaptation, but that's because they haven't accepted the fact that a movie is a different thing, and it can't possibly be the same as the book.","The fact that I lost my son permeates my being.","I think 'The Giver' is such a moral book, so filled with important truths, that I couldn't believe anyone would want to suppress it, to keep it from kids.","I don't for one second think about the possibility of censorship when I am writing a new book. I know I am a person who cares about kids and who cares about truth and I am guided by my own instincts, and trust them.","If somebody takes the time, a: to read a book that I have written, and then to b: care about it enough to write me and ask questions, surely I owe them a response.","We live in times that are in many ways ambiguous. Maybe that's why kids want precision in what they read - they don't like that moral ambiguity.","I don't read young adult or children's books, now that my grandchildren are beyond the age of my reading to them. I read reviews, and so I'm aware of what's out there. But I tend not to read the books.","'Gathering Blue' was a separate book. I wanted to explore what a society might become after a catastrophic world event. Only at the end did I realize I could make it connect to 'The Giver.'","When I create characters, I create a world to inhabit and they begin to feel very real for me. I don't belong in a psych ward, I don't think, but they become very real, like my own family, and then I have to say goodbye, close the door, and work on other things.","I was fortunate to live for 3 years in another country, and although we lived in an American compound, still as a young adolescent I did venture into the world of the Japanese with great interest and enjoyment. But many Americans never left that safe and familiar life among their own people.","I think of every book as a single entity, and some have later gone on to become a series, often at the request of readers.","Kids have no sense of appropriateness. They can ask me whatever they want. You do develop a sense of intimacy with readers, and they tell you things about themselves. During a school year, I'll get e-mails asking about the books. I'll give them information, but I won't do their homework for them.","If we as writers could predict what readers grab on to, we would write it.","I majored in English in college, so I read the classic dystopian novels like '1984' and 'Brave New World.'","Oddly, the military world is one of great sameness. There is an orderly quality to life on an army base, and even the children of the military are brought up with that sense of order and sameness.","I'm not terribly conversant with children's literature in general. I tend to read books for adults, being an adult.","I think I've written 40 books, and none of them have been heavy on action. I'm an introspective person.","I would say that most of my books are contemporary realistic fiction... a couple, maybe three, fall into the 'historic fiction' category. Science fiction is not a favorite genre of mine, though I have greatly enjoyed some of the work of Ursula LeGuin. I haven't read much science fiction so I don't know other sci-fi authors.","People are starting to refer to 'The Giver' as a classic, but I don't know how that is defined. But if it means that 10, 20, 50 years from now kids will still be reading it, that is kind of awe-inspiring.","The grand surprise has really been the fact that being an author, which to me had always implied being a private person, actually requires you to be a public person as well, and those are two separate entities to me.","I have been fortunate. I have done so many things and enjoyed so many things and had such a great life, not to imply that it is ending, but that there aren't many things that I feel I have left undone.","There will always be a place for bunnies to talk in rhyme, but that's not what I do.","I don't set out to transmit a message. I don't write with a political point of view. There are no religious overtones. Looking back at my books, I can say, 'Oh, yes, it is there.' But it's not in my mind when I write.","What comes to me always is a character, a scene, a moment. That's going to be the beginning. Then, as I write, I begin to perceive an ending. I begin to see a destination, although sometimes that changes. And then, of course, there's the whole middle section looming.","I tend not to think about audience when I'm writing. Many people who read 'The Giver' now have their own kids who are reading it. Even from the beginning, the book attracted an audience beyond a child audience.","Many of the books I loved as a kid, that even my mother read as a child, are very slow going. Today's children are not as patient. The best example of this is 'The Secret Garden,' which I adored as a child.","I think when you've had success, publishers and reviewers and readers are willing to let you try something new if you've already proven yourself. They're excited about what you're doing, you have people interested in it, and actually waiting for it. It's empowering.","Writing is self employment, so you can make your own schedule.","I never, as a reader, have been particularly interested in dystopian literature or science fiction or, in fact, fantasy.","I prefer to surprise myself as I'm writing. I'm not interested in it if I already know where it's going. So I have only the most general sense of what I'm doing when I start a story. I sometimes have a destination in mind, but how the story is going to go from Point A to Point Z is something I make up as I go along.","You rehear your life by reading about what happens to other people.","When I was a kid in the '50s, during the Eisenhower years, everything seemed to be working fine. I don't recall as a teenager ever worrying about the state of the future world.","Nowadays it seems as though people sit down to write what they know is going to be a trilogy.","One hopes that with a book or movie, the reader or the audience will emerge from it thinking. That's the most you can hope for: that you've raised questions that will be there for the audience to think about later.","As female hormones decrease, they're replaced with an overwhelming urge to grow delphinium.","People in the know say 'The Giver' was the first young adult dystopian novel.","My mind is always on whatever next project I'm working on.","There are those, I think, who are attracted to the glitz of celebrity life. I am not one of them.","I'm a writer; I like to retain subtlety and nuance.","Most people remember being 4 objectively, as if they're seeing a movie of a 4-year-old. But me, if you ask me to think about when I'm 4, I can feel myself being 4, and I am there, looking out through my 4-year-old eyes.","This may sound strange, but at a very early age, at around 3, I was aware that I was smarter than the other kids.","Because I have two houses, I invariably get immersed in a book and then discover it's at the other house.","When I moved from Cambridge, I donated all my fiction. I carefully cut out pages the authors had autographed for me. I didn't want those autographed books showing up on eBay.","I always set out to tell a good story, to create a character that young people can relate to, place them in a situation that will be interesting, intriguing, eventually suspenseful. But what I find is that after I do that, then there are themes that emerge, which teachers can then use to provoke discussion and debate."],"Lois McMaster Bujold":["The dead cannot cry out for justice. It is a duty of the living to do so for them.","Seems like half my anxiety dreams are about airports.","I'm very interested in the impact of biotechnology on the way people live.","I spent my 20s working in patient care at a large university hospital, an experience that has informed all my work and has given me a lot of human observation to draw on.","What you are is a question only you can answer.","When you can't do something truly useful, you tend to vent the pent up energy in something useless but available, like snappy dressing.","War is not its own end, except in some catastrophic slide into absolute damnation.","Some prices are just too high, no matter how much you may want the prize. The one thing you can't trade for your heart's desire is your heart.","Escapist literature gets a bad rap. But I think escape is important for a lot of people in a lot of places.","I think 99 percent of women's lib comes from technology making different kinds of lives possible, and then the social adjustment follows the technology - it doesn't precede it.","For me, writing is more a process of discovering the book than planning it.","I began my writing career in a very isolated place and time.","Wikipedia is so dangerous."],"Lois Tilton":["I have an interest in understanding evil. Who is the bad guy - the vampire who kills people and sucks their blood, or the survivalists who kill people to save their own lives? Is evil merely a creation of people? Or is there an evil nature? Or is it in the eye of the beholder? I really like these questions.","I want my readers to be disturbed. I want them to ask, 'Could this really happen?' It is my job to think up new possibilities, to stimulate thought.","About the time you might start to think that science fiction - the real stuff, not the species of fantasy that goes under the name - is really dead, along comes a story by Cory Doctorow."],"Lois Wyse":["Grandchildren are the dots that connect the lines from generation to generation.","A mother becomes a true grandmother the day she stops noticing the terrible things her children do because she is so enchanted with the wonderful things her grandchildren do.","Age becomes reality when you hear someone refer to that attractive young woman standing next to the woman in the green dress, and you find that you're the one in the green dress."],"Lola Kirke":["The classical music scene was completely unfamiliar to me. It was something that I didn't have the most fun associations around. A lot of people don't - they think of older generations and stuffiness. But it's not. You listen to the Overture of 1812, and you can hear a rock n' roll catharsis.","I think the merging of high and low culture is so fascinating.","We have this idea of artists being on the fringe and being debauched and strange. I don't think that people who commit themselves to classical arts should be exempt from that.","The oboe is the most maddening thing of all time. I'm struggling to play something that my oboe teacher was doing when she was much younger than I am.","I will never be good at the oboe. No matter what happens, I will never be good at it because I just don't have that much time on my hands. I don't have the gift of going back to being a child and having my brain develop around this instrument.","As somebody who has wanted to be an actor who is very young, I can relate to somebody who has been practicing oboe five days a week since they were very young. The physicality of anything a character does is a tremendous gift.","I'm practicing the oboe. But I don't play. Just single notes, not an entire piece of music.","I'm the only one in my family with an American accent.","I spend a lot of time doing watercolors and playing music in my apartment.","I definitely wanted to be famous as a kid, but as I've gotten older, I feel less comfortable with it."],"Loleatta Holloway":["I never thought of myself as a good singer.","When I was 5 years old I started singing in church and I hated my voice because I sounded like a grown woman, not a child. I was ashamed of it."],"Lolo Jones":["Maybe there's a little girl who thinks she can be an Olympic athlete, and she sees all the things I struggled through to get here. Yeah, I didn't walk away with a medal or run away with a medal, but I think there's lessons to be learned when you win and lessons to be learned when you lose.","I definitely would say, by sixth grade, I was a professional shoplifter - and not because I wanted to. I'm not going out to shoplift earrings or clothes or shoes like the average teenager. I was shoplifting frozen dinners at a grocery store.","Sometimes bad things are going to happen in your life, and those things can make you stronger if you just learn how to get over them.","I am training at such a high level that I actually could eat anything and get by. But as my coach always says, your body is like a car, and food is like your fuel. I am a race car, so I can't just put unleaded fuel in my car. I need that good premium fuel.","The Olympics are only once every four years, so you have to take advantage of all your opportunities, both to be an inspiration to people and help support your sponsors who help you.","Running was like the friend that never left. It was just always there.","I listen to a lot of Christian music, and reading my Bible calms me down immensely.","When I'm standing in a stadium packed with 80,000 screaming fans, I can't just whip out my Bible before I run. That's when I start praying! It's so loud that I can't even hear what I'm saying, but it always helps.","I didn't have a big-time contract out of college like most athletes. In fact I had no contract at all.","There's definitely a whole double standard. I don't understand it. A guy can be sexy and good-looking, and it totally just enhances his credibility as an athlete.","If a female is good-looking, it totally decreases her credibility. Now she's not a good athlete - she's only good in these track meets because she's good-looking."],"Longchenpa":["Self-appearing subjects and objects are the power of the baseless ultimate truth.","Realization that is beyond characteristic or designation is marvelous!"],"Loni Anderson":["Look at any black-and-white movie; everybody is smoking.","You're always better off if you quit smoking; it's never too late.","Smoking is related to practically every terrible thing that can happen to you.","Your lungs are changed forever from your first cigarette.","My dad had emphysema and both of my parents had chronic bronchitis and ended up with cancers - all smoking related.","Impotence is one of the major hazards of cigarette smoking.","Three cigarettes in, your body already craves it. It is that addictive.","It's amazing to me that young people will still pick up a cigarette.","There's nothing glamorous about being dead.","My grandmother was a teacher, my sister was a teacher, my daughter was a teacher and is now a superintendent in northern California, and my son-in-law is a high school principal. I am surrounded.","If somebody invented cigarettes today, the government would not legalize them.","We have so much lung capacity that we don't even notice a problem until we are in our 40s.","When women smoke, it is hard for them to quit because they are so worried about their weight; it's a vanity issue and a mindset.","Young people think that nothing bad will ever happen to them.","Almost every person over 45, and definitely those who have ever smoked, should have a spirometry test.","I've always been very involved in anything that had to do with lung disease or cancer.","You're rejected 10 to 20 times for every part you are going to get.","They almost ran me off the road several times. There are so many chances that they take to get the right photo.","There is no cure for emphysema, but you can start treating it and have a better quality of life.","The theater is where I belonged; I simply wanted to be an actress my whole life.","My sister and I are both diagnosed with second-hand smoke syndromes. We have never smoked, but we grew up with second-hand smoke our entire lives.","My mom started smoking when she was 11. She went to the hill next door to try her first cigarette. She set the entire hill on fire, but it didn't deter her.","My memory of my mom is a wine glass in one hand and a cigarette in the other. She was a runway fashion model, and she was quite a glamorous woman.","My daughter teases me once in a while saying, Remember when you used to be my mother and you had black hair?","Look up the definition of rejection in the dictionary, get really comfortable with it, and then maybe you can go into acting.","In the movies, Bette Davis lights two cigarettes and hands the second one to James Cagney. It was just so glamorous and romantic.","I talk about acting to students making the transition from high school to UCLA. Kids going into this profession really need to know the reality of it.","I started acting when I was 10, doing musical theater. I was a brunette at that time. I was always cast in all the exotic parts.","I have an education degree from the University of Minnesota, and I was a teacher for about a minute.","I do know the Spelling family. I worked for Aaron Spelling when I was a brunette. I've known them since Tori was a little girl.","I am the odd man out in the family.","I've been working with the National Lung Health Education Program to raise awareness about Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.","I'd had my daughter when I was a teenager - I took my daughter to college with me.","As a brunette, I had previously been this serious actress. Then I became a blonde and got to play a completely different, comic role."],"Loni Love":["There is nothing like a live performance. You can look at things on television, and you can look at things on YouTube, but when you get in a room full of people and you say one joke, and everyone's laughing at the same thing, it's a really great experience.","I will never say never, but I can tell you right now - I am perfectly happy with being who I am. I just - I really - I'm an entertainer, and the thing that I'd decided to work on was my career, and I decided the energy that I was putting in certain relationships - I was really kind of wasting my time, and I knew it.","I've been studying myself because I always want to improve.","I have a fear of being broke. That's what I have a fear of. I'm not kidding.","Being in the Girl Scouts took me out of the projects environment and showed me different things.","Whatever you're destined to do, you will be.","Life is funny, and that's why I celebrate it in my shows.","I keep doing stand-up because the world needs laughter - there's always something happening in the country and in the world. That's why I wanted to become an entertainer: to help people forget about their problems for a little while.","The thing is being honest with yourself. There's no rule that says you have to be married and have kids.","I like having peace and quiet in my life, and I am perfectly happy in my relationships.","I love being a regular on 'Chelsea Lately!'","One of my dreams was to change the way women of color were seen on television.","If you are a woman with your own money, you have confidence. You have the pick of the litter.","I appreciate the audience for checking us as comics.","'SNL' ain't been relevant since Jim Belushi. It's on every week; it's not funny. They need to find some black women to put on there to make it funny.","I do think the audiences have a right to judge what they feel is offensive and not.","Mom was a nurse's aide. She worked in various hospitals. She took care of us that way, and we ate government cheese. I survived.","I'm hearing from fans about how they got out of an abusive relationship. That's why I tell people you've got to watch 'The Real.' We are about comedy and inspiration, but personal moments come up, and people are moved by it.","At my job, my manager had a massive heart attack; we had layoffs. It made me realize that nothing is certain, nothing is for sure, and if I'm going to make a move, I gotta make a move now.","I did all this standup comedy in college, and from that point on, I tried to develop myself and get my name back out there.","I worked harder at my craft, and it took some time, but here I am today doing what I want to do, which is entertain people.","In 'Mother's Day,' which is directed by legendary director Garry Marshall, I play a mother figure to the character played by Jason Sudeikis from 'Saturday Night Live.' He's a widower, and I'm a mother who's helping him to get over the loss of his wife.","We have to remember that people are free to love who they want to love. That also means that black women are free to love who they want to love.","I don't have a lot of time for television because I am making it, so it's really hard for me to sit down. But when I do get a chance, I try to catch up on 'Scandal,' 'Empire' and 'black-ish.'","I think that, for so long, there was only one type of actor, and now you see these different colors, different people, different shapes and different sizes. It just makes it more interesting.","I am a seasoned performer.","We provide comedy for everybody, no matter what your race or gender. We just want people to come out and have a really good time.","The late, great Joan Rivers actually gave me so much advice, and she was so nice to me before she passed.","It's always good to laugh.","The thing is, it's that Detroiters are hard workers. We've always been hard workers, even when times are down. I've been able to take that with me, that work ethic, to help me build my career.","Now that I live in Los Angeles, if I meet somebody from Detroit, it's like there's this brother- or sisterhood, where we're real folks.","Anyone driving a 1992 Cutlass, take it back, because I built it.","I do like to laugh at and talk about relationships.","I do talk about celebrity relationships like Kim Kardashian's. I like to find the humor in love.","That's a nice thing about being a topical standup: you can add in things to keep it fresh.","I couldn't be where I am today if I had children. My focus would be on my children and home. And you can do it later in life.","I made the conscious decision to not have kids, and I didn't want to be married.","I have relationships. I date. But it takes a lot to say I'm going to be married and have children.","Men don't know how to act like men sometimes. Take the trash out. Open up the door. Rub my feet. I mean, it's a two-way street!","You men make up these rules, and now you get mad because I'm telling you what a real woman wants.

So to make Lord more feminine, I just put an 'e' on the end! Some people think it's religious, but it's not.","Obviously I've had this fascination with aristocracy my whole life. Like, the kings and queens of 500 years ago... they're like rock stars. If there was a 'TMZ' 500 years ago, it would be about, like, Henry VIII and Marie Antoinette and all those people.","I'm, like, the most terrible person to go to a party with in the world, because I just can't enjoy it. I'm just thinking all the time about what it means and what the implications are.","I went to my prom. I wore this olive green, floor-length backless dress. It was rad.","I actually love Twitter and Instagram. I do think it's so strange to think that 20 years ago, people would never have known personal stuff about musicians and actors, but I like it. As long as I don't obsessively overshare, it's OK. And when I do overshare, it's just, like, me saying, 'I've got $7 in my bank account!'","It must have been when I was 14 or 15 that I started tentatively writing songs and was able to convey an emotion and a lyric with what I wanted to say.","I come from a short fiction background, and my mom is a poet, so I've always read poetry; I've always had a lot of different influences both linguistically and musically.","With pop music and pop musicians, you know everything about everyone all the time, particularly their physical appearance. With female musicians, that's made a big thing of, and I think people, certainly with me, have appreciated a bit of mystery.","I've always been fascinated with aristocracy. I'm really interested in the Ivy Leagues, the final clubs, all the really old-money families, the concept of old money.","Grace Jones was an influence, because I was like, 'These shoulders! These pants! Girls can wear pants and be awesome.' That's something I definitely embody.","I'm usually really drawn to a song, and I know it would be good to cover if it sounds like something that I could write, or I wished I could write. Sometimes a writer just sounds like they're in your head, and that is really cool for me.","I find a lot of feminist reading quite confusing and that often there's a set of rules, and people will be like, 'Oh, this person isn't a true feminist because they don't embody this one thing,' and I don't know, often it can be a gray area, and it can be a hard thing to navigate.","I'm a pop princess at heart. Pop is about distilling what you want to say and making it easy. And the way I write isn't about making things easy. It's a weird juxtaposition.","Musicians like James Blake were a big influence on me. How he uses his vocals is amazing. And then Yeasayer and Animal Collective, who aren't pop bands exactly, but they do something that is so catchy and undeniable and so much fun.","If I'm going to dress up, I like things that are quite long and classic. I like feeling dressed up and like a lady.","In a perfect world, I would never do any interviews, and probably there would be one photo out there of me, and that would be it.","My dad is a civil engineer, and my mom is a stay-at-home mom. The fact that my parents weren't really involved in music was kind of good, because it meant that I had something that was private and personal.","People respond to something which intrigues them instead of something that gives them all the information - particularly in pop, which is, like, the genre for knowing way too much about everyone and everything.","I don't think people look at how pop stars live and feel anything aspirational at all.","Nobody asks me about what male musicians I think about; I only ever get asked about females.","I'm very conscious of people having pretty short attention spans: I know, I'm guilty of it. I'm 17 now: what happens by the time I'm 21, am I a burn-out or something? Will they still listen to my record?","I've been in some situations where people have treated me like a fascinating toy. You know, it's just like an interesting kind of fun thing to have a play with. It's very weird for me. I feel like a tiny baby.","I come from a big, loud family, and I'm the quieter one. Performing is something I have to switch on. I've heard I get real sassy onstage, which I'm not in real life! It's fun to be that person for an hour a night.","I started writing music when I was around twelve. My current record company saw a video of me performing at my school's talent show.","I've always hung out with people older than me, with my parents' friends, because I appreciated the conversation.","I love Top 40 pop, don't get me wrong; I just don't think that there's anyone in Top 40 pop that's 'real.'","I've always listened to a lot of rap. It's all, 'Look at this car that cost me so much money, look at this Champagne.' It's super fun.","Coming from New Zealand, all the music I listen to is not made by New Zealanders. People never come to New Zealand to play a show because it's in the middle of nowhere.","I try to stay away from talking about boys all the time. You can go to Taylor Swift to hear that."],"Lorelei Linklater":["I really like bowling.","I think a lot of people who are child actors - it's a weird thing.","I do like pop music. It's that certain thing that it gives you: the adrenaline rush, that instant gratification.","I liked to dye my hair as a teenager. I dyed it a lot of different colours: blue, red, pink.","I was very interested in acting as a kid. I loved to perform.","I was pretty obnoxious as a kid.","I had a nice life. It had its challenges like anybody's life, I guess.","I have two younger sisters who are 11 years younger than me. So I was an only child for a while.","I love Harry Potter. I've read all the books several times."],"Loren Eiseley":["One could not pluck a flower without troubling a star.","If there is magic on this planet, it is contained in water.","Every time we walk along a beach some ancient urge disturbs us so that we find ourselves shedding shoes and garments or scavenging among seaweed and whitened timbers like the homesick refugees of a long war.","God knows how many things a man misses by becoming smug and assuming that matters will take their own course.","Tomorrow lurks in us, the latency to be all that was not achieved before.","Man is always marveling at what he has blown apart, never at what the universe has put together, and this is his limitation.","It is frequently the tragedy of the great artist, as it is of the great scientist, that he frightens the ordinary man.","One does not meet oneself until one catches the reflection from an eye other than human.","Like the herd animals we are, we sniff warily at the strange one among us.","When the human mind exists in the light of reason and no more than reason, we may say with absolute certainty that Man and all that made him will be in that instant gone."],"Lorene Scafaria":["No texting. What happens then? Good old-fashioned letters.","I escaped to New York, and then L.A., but when I dream of home, I still dream of my old house in Holmdel.","Routine is part of coping.","In the '90s there were these great end of the world movies like 'Armageddon' and 'Deep Impact'... I always liked the idea of what people on the ground are doing, not so much the people who are trying to stop the world from ending.","For me, modern technology has ruined romance and movies - nobody can run to the airplane gate anymore.","I've been obsessed with doomsday for a long time - the idea that different cultures respond to it differently, and religions will change people's outlook on it.","I liked to think I had written 'scripts' when I was in high school, but looking back at them, they were about thirty pages of wannabe-Mamet dialogue with a staple through them.","Work harder than everybody. Read scripts, watch movies. Help other writers, it makes you better. And probably move to L.A.","The best thing you can give me is your time. The easiest way to get me angry is to waste my time.","I think, as a woman, you do sort of have to work twice as hard, but I don't feel as if I wasn't given opportunities.","It's really hard as a screenwriter, you feel like you have a vision and then you turn it over to a director and you have to let it go.","No I don't really write thinking about specific actors because it can get in the way a little bit.","I think when you take forever off the table, it does something really interesting to what you think is important. There's something a little freeing about it.","What do they call it, Y.O.L.A., you only live once? I think people are sort of gravitating towards that.","Most of my nightmares that jolt me awake either involve the cosmos or something completely out of human control. In reality, I worry more about nuclear war, or war in general.","I'm a person that thinks time is very precious and our only commodity... It's so upsetting when I feel like something has wasted my time.","I'm from Jersey, so I have a love of T.G.I. Friday's and chain restaurants in general. When you go to a Friday's, it seems like everyone's on ecstasy and way too happy anyway."],"Lorenz Hart":["How we love sequestering, where no pests are pestering.","Painters of paintings, writers of books, never could tell the half.","Unrequited love's a bore.","Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true.","Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I."],"Lorenza Izzo":["I go to shady places all the time.","Boom, I move to L.A. after doing 'Aftershock,' and I've been actually working here. So it's all been 'boom'; it's all been 'boom' everything. It's so exciting. It's been amazing. I'm a very lucky girl.","Whenever I'm terrified of anything, I jump to it.","I love kids. I always have. I was an only child until I was 12, and then my sister arrived."],"Lorenzo Lamas":["My mission in life was to make sure that there were no women walking around who didn't know me personally.","There are so many cameras. There is so much instant media attention, not just for celebrities, but for normal people that get thrust in the reality world.","I'm not too secure about my looks. They can always change. I was heavy and overweight as a teenager, so it's hard to be cocky or egotistical.","Nothing is inevitable with relationships."],"Lorenzo Snow":["I am here wrongfully convicted and wrongfully sentenced.","As man now is, God once was; as God is now man may be.","There is no Latter day Saint who dies after having lived a faithful life who will lose anything because of having failed to do certain things when opportunities were not furnished him or her.","They will sustain the constitution and laws and institutions of the United States, and be the champions of liberty and of that constitution when its integrity shall be threatened.","We thank thee for this opportunity to show our love for these heroes who have accomplished such wonders for the beloved United States, which was founded by noble and inspired men."],"Lorenzo di Bonaventura":["What I can't figure out is why we're not making more R-rated movies, actually.","The amount of piracy is extraordinary. People don't realize how big it is.","If the studio wants to spend money on making your movie better, let them.","I mean, I'm not a contrarian.","I think when you're doing something cutting edge like 'The Matrix,' it might mean when everybody's saying 'no' that you're really on the right track.","One of the things that's driving films in a particular direction is that the after market value of them is dropping really fast and in many segments of it, not just DVDs. Pay television is dropping.","My experience is that you can't possibly win against whatever the tidal wave is that's coming at you.","The action pictures I've been typically involved with, when somebody gets punched, you really feel the punching, and when somebody gets shot, you really feel the shot.","What I keep searching for in movies, more and more, is the right gravity.","I don't like the term 'ensemble.' It's bland to me.","As a producer, I try to bring as many nice people as I can to insure that there's no screaming, there's no shouting, there's no bullying. The more of those kind of people that you can bring together, the better the experience everyone has on set.","It's so hard to find a director who, when you look at their body of work, you like everything.","People laugh at me because I don't even know what I'm doing tomorrow."],"Loretta Devine":["There are etiquette things that actors, new actors, need to know about. Because it only takes one mess-up on a set to get fired. Not being where you're supposed to be or saying something to the wrong person that you're not supposed to say, and those are like basic things that the actors need to know.","The message has become clearer to the nation about AIDS. People used to think they could catch it all kinds of ways, but we now know that it is absolutely passed through bodily fluids.","The fact that a person loves one particular person is what is important; the life lesson, whether you are homosexual or heterosexual, is that you not be promiscuous, and true to one person.","I'm in the process of trying to find something that I could do on my own.","I still have to audition for most things.","I get a lot of independent films from people who are starting out.","People see a lot of huge stuff on Broadway, but there's always Off-Broadway energy and also shows that you can work in.","For movies, I usually do an entire book that has all kinds of things about what is happening at the time the movie is going on and try to get into what my character's going to be like, to try to get some consistency, because they shoot movies out of order."],"Loretta Lynch":["Voting is how we participate in a civic society - be it for president, be it for a municipal election. It's the way we teach our children - in school elections - how to be citizens, and the importance of their voice.","No matter who we are or where we live, we all share a basic concern for the safety and well-being of our young people. Their welfare is the most telling measure of our nation's success - and their potential is the most promising element of its future. It is up to us - all of us - to safeguard that future.","We all have a responsibility to protect endangered species, both for their sake and for the sake of our own future generations.","Everyone wants to be seen. Everyone wants to be heard. Everyone wants to be recognized as the person that they are and not a stereotype or an image.","Let us not act out of fear and misunderstanding, but out of the values of inclusion, diversity, and regard for all that make our country great.","The American people must be able to trust that their courts and law enforcement will uphold, protect, and defend their constitutional rights.","What is the price of justice? What is the price of justice? When bail is set unreasonably high, people are behind bars only because they are poor. Not because they're a danger or a flight risk - only because they are poor. They don't have money to get out of jail and they certainly don't have money to flee anywhere.","Instead of turning away from our neighbors, our friends, our colleagues, let us instead learn from our history and avoid repeating the mistakes of our past.","This country was founded on a promise of equal rights for all, and we have always managed to move closer to that promise, little by little, one day at a time. It may not be easy - but we'll get there together.","The power to arrest - to deprive a citizen of liberty - must be used fairly, responsibly, and without bias.","The motto of the Netherlands is translated into English as 'I will uphold.' But I want you to know that, as we go forward, our message together is not just 'I will uphold,' but 'we will uphold.'","Often, we do not know where our choices will take us. This is why the best choices are often made based not on what they can bring to us, but what they will allow us to bring to others.","Almost one in three Americans has had some contact with the criminal justice system. When you reach that saturation point, people begin to understand, in a very visceral way, the difficulties of reentry.","I believe that the death penalty is an effective penalty.","Building trust between law enforcement officers and the communities we serve is one of my highest priorities as attorney general.","Those who store, package, and sell the food we serve our families have a responsibility to maintain basic standards of cleanliness in their facilities.","We have determined as a society, as a country, as a people, that the incarceration and the supervision and the specific fines for a particular crime are that person's debt to society.","Violent ideologies can proliferate and spread; threats are no longer contained by borders and oceans; and adversaries are as likely to be found in cyberspace as on the battlefield.","We must continue working to build trust between communities and law enforcement. We must continue working to guarantee every person in this country equal justice under the law. And we must take a hard look at the ease with which wrongdoers can get their hands on deadly weapons and the frequency with which they use them.","We must reject the easy impulses of bitterness and rancor and embrace the difficult work, but the important work, the vital work of finding a path forward together.","Members of organized crime continue to exploit their victims the old-fashioned way - through violence, threats and intimidation. As law enforcement has so successfully done before, we will employ our own time-tested techniques to bring them to justice to account for their crimes.","In 2007, Michael Grimm, former Marine, former FBI agent, accountant and attorney, was poised for success as a small business owner. Instead, as alleged, Grimm made the choice to go from upholding the law to breaking it. In so doing, he turned his back on every oath he had ever taken.","Criminal conduct by police officers, federal agents, and their confederates cannot be tolerated and will be met with the full force of the law.","It's the choices that you make and the things that you're willing to accept and not accept that define who you are.","Whether it is tribalism, racism, xenophobia, or anti-Muslim backlash we're talking about, we spend so much time and energy fighting ways to divide ourselves from others.","Certainly, by providing individuals coming out of institutions with ways to become productive citizens, we reduce recidivism. What that means is we reduce crime. There are fewer victims when individuals have options - when they have job skills, when they have life skills, we break the cycle of children following their parents into institutions.","It's always interesting when people don't know who you are.","I find that people want aggressive policing if they as a community feel they are part of it. They don't want aggressive policing if they feel it's being imposed upon them and they are a target.","The good in this world far outweighs the evil. Our common humanity transcends our differences, and our most effective response to terror is compassion, it's unity, and it's love.","What matters is that there is somewhere for those who are troubled, threatened or afraid to turn to in their darkest hour. What matters is that there are those who are willing and able to use the law as an instrument of inclusion, of protection, and of freedom.","Those who perpetrate fraud against our financial institutions will be met with the full force of law enforcement.","The answer is never violence. Rather, the answer, our answer, all our answer must be action. Calm, peaceful, collaborative and determined action.","Let me say that if the political arena is your choice as you work to keep our democracy strong and our essential freedoms accessible for all, then that is what you should do, and I salute you. We need champions in all walks of our civic discourse.","A license to practice law is not a license to violate it.","To the extent residency preferences prevent families and senior citizens from purchasing homes because of race, ethnicity or color, the preferences violate federal law and cannot be tolerated.","Housing programs designed to help young families and senior citizens purchase homes should be available to people of all races, including African Americans.","He could have made a difference. He could have brought real jobs and development to hard working communities that need and deserve those resources. Instead, William Boyland, Jr. worked to glorify one person, and that was himself.","Jimmy Meng sought to be a power broker in the halls of justice. But the influence he sought to peddle was corrupt, and his power was illusory.","Rather than let their product compete fully and fairly in the marketplace, FalconStor resorted to bribery and graft to win important contracts in a scheme that reached the highest levels of the company.","The 'Ndrangheta is an exceptionally dangerous, sophisticated and insidious criminal organization, with tentacles stretching from Italy to countries around the world.","The public properly relies upon FDA classification of drugs as nonprescription as a reflection of the agency's judgment regarding the safety and proper use of a drug without a doctor's prescription.","Michael Grimm never met a tax he didn't lie to evade.","The sentence imposed on Abdul Kadir sends a powerful and clear message. We will bring to justice those who plot to attack the United States of America.","Russell Defreitas plotted to commit a terrorist attack that he hoped would rival 9/11.","Those who willfully conceal assets overseas undermine the playing field for all taxpayers.","Christopher Finazzo had a great job that paid him millions of dollars, but this honest living was apparently not enough to satisfy his greed.","You would notice if your own personal debit card limit shot up to $40 million dollars. And you'd probably call somebody.","It's a great thing to live in a digital age. It's convenient; it's fast.","I truly love coming to work every day.","Others will always seek to define you based on what they think you represent or who they think you are. But you have to be the one to control what you do and what you say and how you present yourself.","I think it's important, however, that as we again talk about the importance of free speech we make it clear that actions predicated on violent talk are not America they are not who were they are not what we do and they will be prosecuted, so I want that message to be clear also.","We must reflect on the kind of country that we want to build and the kind of society which we are choosing to pass on to our children.","My view is that we cannot be ruled by fear. When we do that, we are not making ourselves see. We are not thinking things through. We are not looking at what works.","Houses of worship can be the heart of a community. They can be the cradle of a family. They can be places where our children go to learn, not just faith, but to make friends. They build connections. They are essential to a healthy America. And every community deserves the right to have those houses of worship operate in safety and peace.","What I have realized is I cannot guarantee the absence of discrimination or hatred or prejudice, but I can guarantee the presence of justice.","I think that overall, the position - on a whole host of issues - should always be toward inclusion and equality.","If we're going to have the view that we're going to protect everyone in this society equally, we have to mean it.","What we must not do - what we must never do - is turn on our neighbors, our family members, our fellow Americans, for something they cannot control, and deny what makes them human.","Let us reflect on the obvious but often neglected lesson that state-sanctioned discrimination never looks good in hindsight.","Every American expects and deserves the protection of law enforcement that is effective, responsive, respectful and, most importantly, constitutional.","When suspicion and hostility is allowed to fester, it can erupt into unrest.","We don't always choose moments. You know, sometimes they choose us.","We don't talk about the timing of open matters, but I certainly agree with the FBI director that in every investigation, no matter whom it involves, we are thorough, we are fair, we are efficient, and we move through the facts and the evidence and come to the conclusions that are called upon.","They expect a certain amount of leniency or mercy from me because I'm a woman, and if you've ever met my mother, you should know that's not even in the cards. She's much tougher than I am - she's a retired schoolteacher, so she's seen it all.","When I speak to a victim or their family, people who were left bruised and battered by someone, and can give them some small relief, I know I'm winning in some small way, and I'm part of a process that sometimes works.","After all we have been through, blacks and other minorities deserve to be protected, as anyone else.","Particularly over the last few decades, technological innovation has offered opportunities to bring people and nations together - but it has also created significant new challenges to law enforcement.","In a world that is more interconnected and interdependent than ever before, it is critical that we work together to uphold the norms and statutes that keep our citizens safe, our countries secure, and our economies fair.","The world needs champions. Too many people still find the path to opportunity closed to them. Too many still find unnecessary obstacles to education, to housing, to the full and free exercise of the right to vote.","What I have seen in my travels across this country is the dedication, the commitment, and the resolve of our brave men and women in law enforcement to improving policing, to embracing the 21st Century Task Force recommendations, and to continuing to have a dialogue that makes our country safer for all."],"Loretta Lynn":["Once in a while I get inspired and finish my act with the hillbilly hoedown.","The country is making a big mistake not teaching kids to cook and raise a garden and build fires.","I'm not a big fan of Women's Liberation, but maybe it will help women stand up for the respect they're due.","We still lend our old house out to relatives.

Now, as countries, former Communist countries, became so-called democratic, people started to be enslaved by their own countrymen.","Decolonization actually boosted slavery.

Ivory Coast is the largest producer of cocoa.","As consumers and as voters we can say 'no' to rogue economics and demand regulation.","Now, I am not saying that there is one single type of individual who is a better type of terrorist than another. What I am saying is that the circumstances that push certain individuals over the edge, to become terrorists, are generally very, very similar.","I think generally the heads of terrorist groups are very, very smart people. They're also great manipulators. I would presume that cult leaders are identical. These sort of individuals are very strong, they have very strong charisma.","I think that anybody can become a terrorist. That's my point of view. But, not everybody can actually kill. In order to reach that level, you have to be deeply convinced.","I've always been very interested in political violence. When I finished high school, I did a small dissertation about political violence and fascism in Italy."],"Loretta Reynolds":["We've been at war for 10 years with this generation of Marines. We've seen women do a whole lot of things between the war in Iraq and the current war in Afghanistan. The fact that I'm sitting here making sure that we continue to put out the best young Marines is just a matter of it being 2011.","I don't think that there's any Marine out there that says she can't do the job because she's a female.","I wanted to be able to say I was a Marine.","There are things you maybe could get by a male drill instructor that a female instructor absolutely is never going to let you get away with. Women are harder on women.","Anytime you're going to take your Marines into harm's way, they are looking for leadership that is calm, assertive, sure of themselves. And quite honestly, I don't think that some of these young Marines care if it's a male or a female. They just want to be properly led."],"Loretta Sanchez":["I try to support groups that are about educating people about different races, different religions, different cultures and different situations so that we can break down the barriers of prejudice and bigotry.","This is my fourth term and my seventh year. My first year was in 1997, the same year for Vic Snyder. It is still exciting to be there even though Washington is not run by Democrats right now, but we are working very hard.","The Vietnamese and the Republicans are, with an intensity, trying to take this seat from which we have done so much for our community - to take this seat and give it to this Van Tran, who is very anti-immigrant and very anti-Hispanic.","I am most grateful for having bad eyesight, which prevented me from becoming a commercial pilot and instead, led me to having the best job in the world - representing the people of California's 47th Congressional District."],"Loretta Swit":["It's never too late to go out and get that feeling back.","I just can't remember a time when I wasn't involved with animals and wildlife.","If you care enough, you make a difference.","The pursuit of happiness is in our Constitution. We're all entitled to have the best we can.","Remember this about the Korean War: The men were drafted; the women volunteered.","If you're 90 and look good in a mini-skirt, go for it. What is 'age appropriate'? Such nonsense. My mother lived to 106, so what's middle-age? Seventy is the new 50.","Our planet is dying. Whales will be extinct before we ever get to know them. They say these creatures are so intelligent. They may disappear from the face of the Earth before we know them, and that is a great tragedy.","So much of life is luck. One day you make a right turn and get hit by a car. Turn left and you meet the love of your life. I think I made the correct turn.","When I went to school, I was in the same mode. I did the things I enjoyed, what I loved.","Everybody has their thing. I think you can always do what you like.","I just can't wait to get out there on stage. There's no anxiety at all. I love being able to take this journey with the audience, because we all have a ball with it - even if we're crying.","M*A*S*H offered real characters and everybody identified with them because they had such soul. The humor was intelligent and it always assumed that you had an intellect.","Animals are thinking, feeling creatures. They're sensitive.","I don't eat or wear animals, but I never tell people not to - that's just my view.","I don't think we should be deprived of the privilege of free speech.","I felt like I was flying without a net. But once I realized that the audience was my partner, I was flying a jet, because the people would allow me to develop the character on stage.","I have certain strong interests that fill my life as well.","I love being creative in all forms.","It wasn't so much that I was all alone on stage, but it was the realization of how much you need the response-you need the audience to tell you where to go.","Shirley Valentine is a beautiful character and so well written. What Shirley speaks and thinks is so logical.","We should be able to be ourselves. Make a political stand if you want to.","You only know what you know.","Hot Lips changed a lot in eleven years. Initially, Margaret Houlihan behaved as though a man were the only thing that could complete her life, and she didn't see what richness her life contained. She gained a lot of self-esteem through the years, and she came to realize that what she did, what she offered, was valuable.","My parents didn't want me to go into show business. They were afraid of what would happen if I didn't succeed. They wanted me to get married and have babies. I never saw marriage and family in my life.","My first thought in life was wanting to be an actor. I was in ballet slippers and on pointe as soon as I could walk. I always wanted to be an actress, not a mother or housewife.","Alan Alda is a dear friend, nothing like the cynical, bitter Hawkeye.","Acting is not hiding to me; it's revealing. We give you license to feel. 'Hey, she's crying, so it's okay if I cry, too.' That's the most important thing in the world, because when you stop feeling, that's when you're dead.","Watching movies was like going to school for me. It still is. You're always learning. Even if it's bad, you're learning what not to do.","When I left the house to become an actress, my mother literally flung her body across the door and said, 'You're killing me!' It was a very strict household. That can be okay, but there was also no nourishment, either.","I'm an art collector, have been for years, and I paint. Needless to say, the artwork in my houses, apartment is extensive.","I'm a movie buff. My mom would take me to a double feature. We'd come out, go have Chinese food, and then go back into another cinema and see another double feature. I feel I'm a child of the movies.","Television is hard work. It's all hard work. Theatre is hard work. I tell you, I have bruises from changing backstage. Those quick changes are really difficult.","I've played some great ladies. Mame. Agnes Gooch in 'Mame,' when I started out in the '60s... it's a beautiful role.","I haven't met a horse I didn't love. I love caring for them, cleaning them. I love doing my own tack and giving them treats.","I never really thought it out. I just woke up one day, and I was involved in all these projects. They just seemed to involve animals.","Don't buy furs: that's No. 1. You can start with that. Then spay and neuter your pets. We destroy millions of them a year. Go to an animal shelter for a cat or dog. And read a book about how to care properly for your particular pet.","Actors are always identified with certain parts. To some, Marlon Brando will always be the Godfather. That's just how it is, whether the character happens to be your own personal favorite role or not. You can't ever get away from it.","Telling parents in New Jersey you want to act isn't exactly like telling them you want to be a doctor or a dentist. There are no guarantees. It's hard, but all the arts are. Can you imagine the pain of writer's block?"],"Loretta Young":["Wearing the correct dress for any occasion is a matter of good manners.","In my dreams, I could be a Princess, and that's what I was. Like most little girls, I believed nothing less than a Prince could make my dreams come true.","A charming woman... doesn't follow the crowd. She is herself.","I believe that prayer is our powerful contact with the greatest force in the universe.","Love isn't something you find. Love is something that finds you.","I'm grateful to God for His bountiful gifts... He gave me courage and faith in myself.","I believe in living today. Not in yesterday, nor in tomorrow.","I was deaf and dumb and blind to all but me, myself and I.","I think making mistakes is as inevitable as receiving disappointments.","In silence - and in self-defense - I figured things out in my own little way.","Glamour is something you can't bear to be without once you're used to it.","I'd lived by quotations, practically all my life.","Unless some misfortune has made it impossible, everyone can have good posture.","There is no personal achievement in being born beautiful.","It's so important to look relaxed.","Your hands, your eyes, your voice, your thoughts are your servants.","I couldn't bear it if anyone knew I had hardly any self-confidence at all.","If you want a place in the sun, you have to expect a few blisters.","Just because you want to be glamorous, don't be a sheep about your eye makeup.","When I left 20th Century-Fox to freelance, my agent believed that getting big money was the way to establish real importance in our industry.","Giving credit where credit is due is a very rewarding habit to form. Its rewards are inestimable.","Nearly everyone I met, worked with, or read about was my teacher, one way or another.","Everything worthwhile, everything of any value, has its price. Everything anyone has ever wanted has come neatly wrapped up in its penalties.","A face is like the outside of a house, and most faces, like most houses, give us an idea of what we can expect to find inside.","Of course it was Mamma who both stopped my career and crystallized my determination to resume it.","I believe in the Golden Rule. I believe in practicing it.","I do not hold with those who think it is all right to do whatever you want so long as it doesn't hurt anyone. Who's to be the judge of that?","I believe you have to nurture your conscience.","No one is ever too old, too rich, too poor, to pray.","What you don't know intrigues you more than what you do know.","If you have enthusiasm, you have a very dynamic, effective companion to travel with you on the road to Somewhere.","I learned you have to fight for yourself in the picture business.","I've always been scared to death of pain - afraid, even, to think of it.","I've learned that getting what you want gives you a pretty high batting average, and leaves you plenty to struggle for.","Just after I entered my teens I suddenly entertained an insatiable enthusiasm for the delightful habit of criticizing others.","I'd thought of myself as a great big motion picture star from the time I was 6.","There are no ugly ducklings.","A pleasant voice, which has to include clear enunciation, is not only attractive to those who hear it... its appeal is permanent.","A charming woman is a busy woman.","As an actress, I have to be objective about myself. If I don't criticize myself, there are plenty who will do a find job of it for me!","Like charity, I believe glamour should begin at home.","I don't yearn to be a child again.","The split second she ceases to care is the only time a woman ceases to be attractive.","I was as impatient about finding my dream man as I was about everything else I wanted.","A face that is really lovely in repose can fall apart if, when its owner stars to talk, she distorts every feature.","Fashion should not be expected to serve in the stead of courage or character.","Gratitude isn't a burdening emotion.","In common with many others in the varied branches of our profession, my academic education is subnormal.","In 1949 there was a new thing called Television, to which my agency and advisers opposed as a performance medium.","I was a very wanting child.","I'm not sure the public knows what it wants.","Certainly tears are given to us to use. Like all good gifts, they should be used properly.","As an actress, emotions are my business, my stock-in-trade. As such, I've dealt with them nearly all my life.","Success can't be forced.","I want no part of making any contribution whatsoever to the despair which eventually follows downbeat thinking.","I can't imagine dating a boy, meeting him only outside the home. What's a home and family for if it's not the center of one's life?"],"Lori Foster":["I love the water. Everything about it. Smelling the humidity in the air, seeing the mist rise in the morning, feeling the dew-wet grass on my bare feet. I love watching the fish jump and the geese land. We even have an eagle here that circles every so often.","We tend to think of human trafficking as a foreign issue, not something that could happen here in our own back yards. But it's a fast-growing problem in the United States, in every area, with no real defined demographic.","The men I write can be intense, quiet, outspoken and outrageous, deadly or fun... but I would never waste time on a hero who wasn't honorable, who didn't protect those who couldn't protect themselves, who didn't value children and pets, who wasn't independent and unselfish.","Having kids is the deal-breaker on shyness! Once you have a baby, you learn to speak up loud and clear to protect them, defend them, and encourage them. I have three sons, so I've experienced that in triplicate.","The charity work is just a part of what I do. Like... I make time to clean my house, to care for my pets, to visit my extended family, because those things are important to me. Same with helping others.","I couldn't write a female who fell to pieces every time something didn't go right in her life. She would just annoy me too much.","I would never write something that made me uncomfortable. I'm not sure it's even possible.","The 'Love Undercover' series features two cops, a street rat, and a construction worker as the lead heroes.","Now, and in the future, my focus is entirely on pets and children. I'm not a person who can turn a blind eye to injustice against them.","There are plenty of secondary characters that I had always hoped to write, but I don't know if it will ever happen. The way contracts work, if you leave one publishing house for another, the characters tend to stay with the previous publishing house.","After 'A Perfect Storm' came out, I heard from a young reader, who had suffered a similar background as 'Arizona,' that I had helped her to find peace. That was the most amazing thing in the world to me.","I think it's very important to support those who can't help themselves - children, animals - and especially to do so in your own neighborhood.","I read 'Pushing the Limit' and 'Dare You To' by Katie McGarry. Fantastic stuff. I had never read young adult before, but now I'm a believer.","I'm up before 6, but then I'm parked in front of the PC until noon.","I'm truly, 100% guided by the characters and my Muse. If one of the characters suddenly decided to do something very different, I'd just go with it. It's much easier to let the Muse drive than for me to try to steer.","I don't need the water to be inspired. My stories inspire me, not the location of where I'm parked. And good thing, since I've had to finish books in airports, in the RV we used to have, the lake house, while on vacation, at home, in the kitchen when my office PC was on the fritz.","How it works for me is that a scene comes to mind, usually a scene between the hero and heroine, that depicts the emotional conflict. From that scene, the characters come alive for me. I don't do a lot of preplanning in any way when I write.","There are certain things I couldn't write because they're not intrinsic to my beliefs. For instance, I couldn't write a hero or heroine who didn't put children first.","I definitely could not write a character that was cruel or unconcerned with animal welfare. For me, not just as a writer but for the person I am, I love animals.","I remember the first time I spoke to an editor. I thought I'd be sick, I was so nervous. The first time I spoke to a large group at a conference, I had the jitters for days beforehand.","I enjoy talking to groups who are interested in the writing process or the industry. I never teach - because truthfully, I don't know how it all works; it just does. Sort of magic-like. But I love to share my experiences and perspectives.","Thanks to social media like Facebook, Twitter and Goodreads, I can easily reach out to so many people. Being a writer gives me the added bonus of a targeted audience: readers, who enjoy targeted 'prizes' for participation in fundraisers - books and other neat promo items.","I despise stereotypes. A gay man can be a macho athlete, or he can be an interior designer or any career in between."],"Lori Greiner":["I've been making products for so long, I have a gut feel for what is right - what will work and what won't. I can tell instantly if it's a hero or a zero.","I've achieved a certain amount of success and now I'm thinking about the good things I can do.","In business it is most often all about getting your foot in the door and once you do, everything opens up and things start to naturally progress into bigger and more opportunities.","I had a history for starting something and maybe getting halfway done. Then I'd see the same thing I was doing on the bestseller list! My ideas were right, but I hadn't done them fast enough.","I have an innate instinct for knowing what's going to work.","I like helping people.","I prefer to like the people I invest in, but it's not an absolute necessity, as long as they have a good mind and I know they'll do whatever it takes to be successful.","I think people don't like when you're not confident about what you're pitching, and they don't want to invest in you or get behind you.","I think running a business, doing what I've done for the last - since 1996, has taught me so many things because I started from just an idea and then had to figure out how to make it, market it, every single thing from soup to nuts on how to get a product done and out there.","I always recommend, if you can, to patent or protect whatever your idea is. If you can't, you have to make your best judgment. Sometimes people don't get anywhere because they sit on something, so afraid to reveal it. And yet, in the reverse, sometimes if you expose something too widely, you can risk losing it.","I had an idea, I was passionate about it and I had to work hard to turn that into a big success and more products.","When I had challenges, it taught me to be more on top of it for the future. Things go wrong all the time when you're running your own business, but it's how you perceive it and deal with it that matters.","People trust I know what I'm doing. I have lots of credibility. I've had years of learning. I know and understand my business."],"Lori Loughlin":["When you don't work for a while, immediately you get a little black mark next to your name.","You have to make difficult choices in your life, and you just have to be happy with them.","Surfing is not my strong point. And... I don't really have a tan. I go to the tanning place, the one that sprays you with color.","When you are developing a character you have to bring so much of yourself to the role.","Playing a fashion designer could be the bane of my existence because I am married to a fashion designer.","It's funny, my girlfriends think that because I am married to a fashion designer, I get all these great tips and hints about great fashion, but it's not like that at all. He never tells me what to wear."],"Lori Petty":["I worked with Ice-T, Ice Cube, and Tupac! But Tupac was the sweetest man in the world. That whole thug thing was an act - it was silly and dumb. He was a complete gentleman and one of the kindest men I've ever met.","I think many actresses want to be famous and want to be the prettiest, and that wasn't my trek. I was thinking, 'I gotta get out of here... how do I get out of here?' I like acting, but I like directing more.","I never wanted to be a bombshell; I wanted to be an actor. I would much prefer to be a woman than a man, but if I was a dude, maybe I'd have Johnny Depp's island because women in this industry after a certain age definitely don't get to do 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'","The first things I did was I was a writer, painter, and photographer, and we grew up very poor, so even though I could get into any college I wanted, there was no way to pay for it.","What you write on the page has nothing to do with when you're on set. When you're on set, it has nothing to do with when you're in the editing room. And when you're in the editing room, it has nothing to do with the final movie. You just have to let it go.","Directing is genderless. The only thing... I love men. I'm not being mean to them, but they can't hear you. I don't have a husband, and so I'm not really attuned to it, but I didn't know that they could not really hear you. Like, I'm talking, and they just walk away.","I just had this New York thing. When I got there, I felt so at home. I said, 'This is where the crazy people go.' It's OK to be yourself in New York. In L.A., it's difficult."],"Lori Singer":["It is an attention-getter. I mean, it's hard to ignore a woman lugging a cello around.","You must remember I grew up around music. Three of my family were musicians."],"Lori Wilde":["For all its ups and downs and challenges, I love writing. We only grow through adversity, so I welcome the difficulties, knowing bumps in the road are my greatest teachers.","My husband is the romantic one in our relationship. He's always doing sweet things for me. Each year, we recreate our first date - it was a blind date, and we met at the zoo, followed by a trip to the museum. I'd have to say that's my favorite romantic date.","I knew from the time I was a young girl that I was destined to be a writer. I'm incredibly stubborn. The more someone tells me I can't do something, the harder I work to prove them wrong. My father's nickname for me when I was growing up was 'Hardhead.'","To be honest, I chose romance because writing a book seemed so dauntingly long. I looked around for something short, discovered Harlequin romances, and decided to read a few to see if I could do it.","I was a latecomer to romance, although I did read gothics. My father used to work for the 'Fort Worth Star-Telegram,' and their book reviewer, author Leonard Sanders, would pass on the gothics for my dad to give to me since Leonard didn't review gothics. I gobbled up books by Mary Stewart, Madeleine Brent, Victoria Holt and Phyllis Whitney.","I thrive under pressure.","Every year, I looked forward to Oprah Winfrey's Favorite Things episode. I watched with my notebook computer in my lap so I could Google the items and order them for the friends and family on my holiday gift-giving list.","Stetsons are the ultimate in cowboy headwear.","Real cowboys wear Wranglers. End of story. Levi's may be chic and trendy, but if you work cattle for a living, you wear Wranglers.","'A Tuna Christmas' is the second in a series of plays created by Joe Sears and Jaston Williams featuring the fictional town of Greater Tuna, the third-smallest town in Texas. What makes these plays so hysterically funny is the accurate portrayal of small-town life in the Lone Star State.","When an author creates a town in her novels, she spends a great deal of time visualizing the streets and buildings, landmarks and topography. And while the town becomes real in her imagination, it's rare for an author to see the place she's created actually spring to life.","Each year, I pick something new to learn. One year, it was learning how to knit, and I got 'The Sweethearts' Knitting Club' out of the experience. Another year, it was to volunteer at the local domestic abuse shelter, and I ended up volunteering there for three years.","Romance novels have the power to bring love into the lives of readers. Through the characters, we get to fall in love every time we pick up a romance novel. What could be better than that?","I crave deadlines. If I don't have a deadline, I become a total slacker, which is why I always have so much on my plate."],"Lorin Maazel":["In these confused times, the role of classical music is at the very core of the struggle to reassert cultural and ethical values that have always characterized our country and for which we have traditionally been honored and respected outside our shores.","I think I infuse the music with a new passion. Part of this is because I have fallen in love: I am in love with the New York Philharmonic. The chemistry has just been right. Beyond expectation.","The Beethoven Experience provided the opportunity to solidify the relationship between the Orchestra and me, the Orchestra and me and the public, between all of us and the city of New York, because Beethoven after all is a really amazing point of reference."],"Lorna Luft":["To me, being grown-up meant smoking cigarettes, drinking cocktails, and dressing up in high heels and glamourous outfits.","There is a time of reckoning in all our lives.","I choose not to think of my life as surviving, but coping.","Vincente understood all too well what was happening to Liza; he had gone through it 40 years earlier with my mother.","Life will force you to make changes you never wanted to make.","People are always asking me what it's like to be Judy Garland's daughter. It's hard to be a legend's child.","I was born in a blender.","Although I loved Liza as a little girl, it would be true to say I really didn't know her.","Children have a way of forcing you back into the present moment.","Barry Manilow has gone from being the love of my life to being a friend for life.","I have spent much of my adult life flinching with pain as I tried to pull out the threads that bound the shadows of my past to me.","The eyebrow pencil and false eyelashes were essential; my mother didn't feel dressed without them.","If you really want to kill yourself, you get a gun and blow your head off.","A career is all very well, but no one lives by work alone.","I used drugs as a social activity; a way to have fun with friends.","My sister Liza and I have never felt that we were in competition.","My mother's life had been destroyed by the Garland legend.","Liza is in the tabloids almost as much as our mother was. She has struggled with her own ghosts and shadows.","I have a healthy body, free of the chemicals that once controlled it.","There are some family traditions I don't want my children to carry on.","The sicker mother got, the stranger the people surrounding her became. I called them The Garland Freaks.","A gay man has no business leading on a heterosexual woman.","The world fell apart. Sirhan Sirhan shot Bobby Kennedy. Why were people shooting all the Kennedys? Had the country gone mad?","The one thing I never questioned about my mother was whether she loved me.","My mother wasn't rational those last years; if she had been, she would have been horrified by her own behavior.","My mother should have been Jewish. She could have taught a class on how to induce guilt.","My mother was a phoenix who always expected to rise from the ashes of her latest disaster. She loved being Judy Garland.","Living in continual chaos is exhausting, frightening. The catch is that it's also very addictive.","I had grown up accustomed to living a life of high drama.","Sinatra was just one of Mom's friends.","I spent an entire evening seated between Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, being charmed from either side. It was pure Hollywood magic.","Dinah had all the class.","Fabio kept asking me out, but I knew we'd never get his ego through the door.","Between them, my parents had 10 marriages.","One trait of addictive families is that we never recognize our own addictions.","When I got a call from Los Angeles to do the Tonight Show, I considered it more of an inconvenience than an opportunity.","Dodi got a lot of criticism when he began dating Princess Diana. No one seemed to think he was good enough for her.","Studio 54 made Halloween in Hollywood look like a PTA meeting.","The most memorable night of The Judy Garland Show for me was the night my mother pulled me out of the audience and sang to me onstage.","When I look back at The Judy Garland Show, I have such mixed feelings. It broke my mother's heart when they canceled it.","My mother's suicide attempts were a way to release anxiety and get attention. Some of the attempts were drug reactions she didn't even remember later on.","One of the oddities about being Judy Garland's daughter was that everyone treated my mother with such awe that they would never have asked me the normal questions kids get about their moms.","Even at al my mother's concerts, I had never seen people go crazy the way they did with the Beatles.","The high point of my entire junior high school career was going backstage to meet George Harrison. I was simply awestruck.","People come up to me as I leave the stage after a performance and tell me tey saw my mother onstage with me every time I sing. I keep a sense of humor about it.","When your parent is a public idol, you never really have a chance to lay that parent to rest.","When my mother signed at MGM, that was the only kind of contract you could sign. There was no such thing as an independent agent.","When you're Judy Garland and you want something, you just pick up the phone and call somebody. Anybody.","Instead of joyfully looking forward to my birth, my mother began systematically preparing for her own death. She was fatalistic.","A star needs all the rest she can get.","The only difference between the Bel Air of the '90s and the Bel Air of my childhood is that now the nannies are Latina instead of British, and the cars European instead of American.","My mother was electric onstage, and I vividly recall the extraordinary power she had over her audiences.","It was at one of the parties at our house that The Rat Pack got started."],"Lorne Michaels":["People go to the zoo and they like the lion because it's scary. And the bear because it's intense, but the monkey makes people laugh.","One of the nice things about being busy is it makes you focus on what's important to you and how you use your time.","Sometimes the wheel turns slowly, but it turns.","To me there's no creativity without boundaries. If you're gonna write a sonnet, it's 14 lines, so it's solving the problem within the container.","I think that Canadians have an incredible reverence for authority and regard for authority, and I think one of the healthy ways that it's challenged is through questioning it, through the polite hostility of comedy.","Could I get a friggin' Hot Pocket around here?","It's better when they laugh, isn't it?","You can tell a lot from someone's eyes.","Yeah, I love Los Angeles."],"Lorraine Adams":["I write sentence to sentence. That's the kind of writer I am. I don't have a plot when I begin. I have to be convinced and I have to be surprised.","I can't write a novel without first really doing reporting. I don't even call it research; it's reporting. That process is very important to the granularity of my writing. I have to know what the reality is so I can be more convincing in the writing.","I can't imagine not reporting. It's such a habit of mind for me, I do it even in my social life. If I'm nervous at a party, I just start interviewing people."],"Lorraine Bracco":["I was dead inside.","You know, growing up, I lived in a neighborhood in Long Island where there was basically one black family. And I remember hearing all the parents and the kids in the neighborhood say racist things about this family.","I thought I was going to be a lot more freaked out by being naked onstage. I think on film I would have been more freaked out, because film is less forgiving. But onstage it's lit so beautifully. It would make my mother look good.","I was jumping out of my skin. It was horrible. I was all over the place, because I'd never been in front of a live audience. That's a whole other element in the play, the audience.","Sometimes there's one person in the audience laughing hysterically, and it's so much fun. You end up playing the entire play to them.","You know, last season I didn't do anything on the show, so I was frustrated. I mean, don't get me wrong: It's nice to get a paycheck. But if you don't really do anything it's not very satisfying.","Everything was coming my way, but I was going down. I was painfully empty.","I'd be like, 'You're a young, vibrant woman. Where are you?' I realized that I had been living in denial.","I was so busy fighting and so busy trying to keep everything above water that I didn't realize I was spiraling downward with nowhere to go.","I have no problem with women in the military, if that's what they want to do.","I was lucky to live 10 years in France, so I learned how to eat and drink there.","I am funny. No one else thinks I am funny. But I am funny.","I don't think I am narcissistic. I think I have low self-esteem.","I am the boss of me. You can't change anyone else. Women think they can. But you know what? You can't.","My family was blue collar, a middle-class kind of thing. My father was born in Detroit, Italian-American. My mother is English. She acted on the stage with Diana Dors. Her parents were French.","I learned nothing while I was in school.","I never bought a stock in my life. I don't understand it. To me it is like Chinese.","If I am going to get in a cab to go home, and I see a sign for an open house, I will go in. I like real estate because I am the boss.","The truth in acting is that we are all hired help. We are a commodity. There is no difference between being an actor and pork bellies."],"Lorraine Gary":["'Jaws' freed me to discover that a successful movie didn't make a damn bit of difference to my life.","I started turning 40 at 38. I had pains all over my body. I couldn't sleep, I had rampant anxiety, and I couldn't stop eating and drinking."],"Lorraine Hansberry":["I am a writer. I suppose I think that the highest gift that man has is art, and I am audacious enough to think of myself as an artist - that there is both joy and beauty and illumination and communion between people to be achieved through the dissection of personality.","The thing that makes you exceptional, if you are at all, is inevitably that which must also make you lonely.","I wish to live because life has within it that which is good, that which is beautiful, and that which is love. Therefore, since I have known all of these things, I have found them to be reason enough - and I wish to live. Moreover, because this is so, I wish others to live for generations and generations and generations and generations.","A woman who is willing to be herself and pursue her own potential runs not so much the risk of loneliness, as the challenge of exposure to more interesting men - and people in general.","Never be afraid to sit a while and think.","As of today, if I am asked abroad if I am a free citizen of the United States of America, I must only say what is true: No.","Seems like God don't see fit to give the black man nothing but dreams - but He did give us children to make them dreams seem worthwhile.","The problem in the world is the oppression of man by man; it this which threatens existence.","I care. I care about it all. It takes too much energy not to care.","I don't want to have anyone else to do my housework. I've always done it myself. I believe you should do it yourself. I feel very strongly about that.","There is always something left to love. And if you ain't learned that, you ain't learned nothing.","The why of why we are here is an intrigue for adolescents; the how is what must command the living.","Men continue to misinterpret the second-rate status of women as implying a privileged status for themselves; heterosexuals think the same way about homosexuals; gentiles about Jews; whites about blacks; haves about have-nots.","If, by some miracle, women should not ever utter a single protest against their condition, there would still exist among men those who could not endure in peace until her liberation had been achieved.","The whole realm of morality and ethics is something that has escaped the attention of women, by and large. And it needs the attention of intellectual women most desperately.","You don't have to go to the kings and queens of the earth - I think the Greeks and Elizabethans did this because it was a logical concept - but every human being is in enormous conflict about something, even if it's how to get to work in the morning and all of that.","Take away the violence and who will hear the men of peace?","I have long since passed that period when I felt personal discomfort at the sight of an ill-dressed or illiterate Negro. Social awareness has taught me where to lay the blame.","I think it is about time that equipped women began to take on some of the ethical questions which a male-dominated culture has produced and dissect and analyze them quite to pieces in a serious fashion. It is time that 'half the human race' had something to say about the nature of its existence.","Children see things very well sometimes - and idealists even better.","I live in the Village, and the way it's been, people sort of drop in on me and my husband. My husband is Robert Nemiroff, and he, too, is a writer.","Once I'm on the phone, I just can't say no. I sometimes find myself doing things for three or four organizations in one day.","Daddy felt that this country was hopeless in its treatment of Negroes. So he became a refugee from America. He bought a house in Polanco, a suburb of Mexico City, and we were planning to move there when he died. I was fourteen at the time.","Mine is, after all, the generation that had come to maturity drinking in the forebodings of the Silones, Koestlers, and Richard Wrights. It had left us ill-prepared for decisions that had to be made in our own time about Algeria, Birmingham, or the Bay of Pigs.","I feel that women - without wishing to foster any strict separatist notions, homo or hetero - indeed have a need for their own publications and organizations. Our problems, our experiences as women are profoundly unique as compared to the other half of the human race."],"Lorraine Toussaint":["We all have a dark side. Most of us go through life avoiding direct confrontation with that aspect of ourselves, which I call the shadow self. There's a reason why. It carries a great deal of energy.","Pretend and real are all real to a psychopath.","As a modern woman, there are things I take for granted, and that shows up in the way I sit, the way I walk, the way I think, and what I know to be possible.","We actors are superstitious creatures. We do all the homework, and we put all of the components together, but there's always one key aspect that we're not in charge of, really, and that's magic. You are always on the lookout for where and how that magic is going to ignite.","I have a big life, a small child, I work, I do a lot of things, so I'm often playing catch-up with what's current.","Anything you need, you can get on YouTube. It's wacky.","When you're playing a real character, you want to honor that person and receive inspiration from that person. They need to anoint you in some way that allows you to borrow just a small piece of their soul. That is the flame.","My job as an actor is to cover and expose in varying allowance that - so that the audience can peek through the window to the people I create.","When you eliminate vanity from an art form, and I would think that this would be any art form, what is left is an opportunity to be incredibly naked and truthful.","I don't think anyone would disagree with this: You are self-directed in daytime, and that's it. So come with it, and bring it on the first take.","Once I'm on set, the only thing I'm really interested in is being in the room. Being present. And trusting that what I've done is sufficient, and I'm also trusting that I've also left room for magic.","I find I often do my best work when I'm not attached to the outcome of the audition.","'Body of Proof' was interesting because... I didn't feel I needed to prove anything in that audition. I didn't over-prepare it, but I was just very relaxed in it.","People's faith, people's beliefs are such a personal thing, and it defies definition. I'm so rarely interested in discussing what I believe or what you believe. I think it's liquid, anyway.","How well I walk my talk, and not talk my talk, determines the quality of my engagement, of all my experience with what is quite personally my God. I'm my greatest teacher, and within me, I have the power to push myself deeper and higher.","I was born odd. I was a strange child. My grandmother was always praying over me. She was always rubbing me and praying over me.","I meditate. I've been a meditator since, I think I was doing it unofficially before all my life and then began to formalize it somewhere around 14.","I think if I weren't an actress, I might have made a halfway decent attorney! I like the way they think.","I've become very fond of the law. I've always been an advocate for justice, which occasionally the law brings to light.","I grew up a middle class, colonized child of teachers and librarians and people, women especially, who treasured education.","I grew up under the British system, which I think is horrific for children - very, very strict - a system that did not recognize children as being individuals. You were small animals earning the right to be human.","I know what it was like to not have a voice, so my daughter has a voice. I veto that voice when needed because at the end of the day I am the grown-up, but I hear her.","I hope that whenever my daughter has a negative experience, I'm there to talk about it and remind her how we feel when it's done to her so that she doesn't do it to others.","I love to see how a character unfolds off the page in a project. I don't always know how the character is going to turn out, even with the script being there. It's not always clear where that character is going to take me. Or where I will take them.","Sometimes the character will go into a completely different direction than I expected once the cameras start rolling. That's what I love about what I do.","I keep waiting for someone to cast me as the angel or the witch or the immortal of some kind because so much of the reading I do for my own pleasure is fantasy, horror, or sci-fi.","I have read every book in the 'Dune' series and every Anne Rice book.","I am so proud of Amelia Boynton. I can burst with pride."],"Lorrie Fair":["I don't know if there are words to describe my motivation.","It's flattering if people think I'm attractive. If it helps, great, but it's not going to get in the way of me wanting to win. That's what I'm all about.","Even if you have a bad game, you have to swallow your pride and sign. It takes a little time, but it makes the kids happy. And it makes you feel good, too.","Everybody thought I was crazy. They thought I should take the money and run. But there was just something special about being a senior at Chapel Hill. I just couldn't leave.","Everywhere you look these days you see Carolina athletes.","Getting a chance to practice six months against my own teammates, who I consider the best soccer players in the world, there's no way I couldn't improve.","Here at Carolina, our World Cup opponents marked their calendars. Obviously the other nations wanted to win every game, but a big upset over the U.S. was something we knew other teams would cherish.","I do feel we have several great keepers on this team. We just need to get them that experience.","I don't know if you could take a whole 90 minutes and say that was the best game we ever played.","I think there is a special bond between Carolina athletes. A lot of people seem to wear our gear because it is fashionable. They love the colors. It's Michael Jordan's school!","I think UNC and Lorrie Fair is a perfect match.","I'm little, but I love big things.","If my soccer career were over, I would still come here because of the people. And despite the fact I've had to skip some school for National Team purposes, I am looking forward to holding that Carolina degree as soon as I can get my hands on it.","It's all a matter of how agents want to handle their clients.","Michael Jordan always wore his Carolina shorts under his Bulls' uniform.","Some people asked me if it was going to be a downer to come back and play on a college team after playing on a world championship team, and I don't think they understand what it is like to play here.","Sometimes I come home and still can't believe it's all mine.","That doll looks more like a black man than me.","The China game was the best because it took the effort of everyone on the team to survive 120 minutes.","The fact that the games were so close was a tribute to the level of skill in the World Cup.","The national team comes before everything.","They are always telling us that Carolina Blue is not a color, that it is really Columbia blue or sky blue. But there is no bad blood amongst the teammates. All of our kidding is in good fun.","This season is my most special and most cherished. All my focus is on getting that championship back here.","UNC symbolizes something special. When you get chills you know you belong here.","We knew it was going to be the biggest event scheduled in the history of women's sports, but we didn't ever fathom we would be playing before sold-out stadiums all over the country."],"Lorrie Moore":["I've never been to a dinner party where everyone at the dinner table didn't say something funny.","I've been falsely accused of drawing too much from real life. But I am a petty thief - I take little things. And, I mean, I can hardly write 10 words before I start to make things up. I start to invent, because that's what I want to do. I'm running away to an invented place.","I grew up with 'Life' magazine on the coffee table, Life cereal on the breakfast table, and the game of Life on the card table. People were just so happy to be alive, I guess.","An author's life is different, complex, and ongoing, while a character's remains frozen in one little story.","I'm not sure that niceness is what we should promote in writers.","The only really good piece of advice I have for my students is, 'Write something you'd never show your mother or father.' And you know what they say? 'I could never do that!'","Twenty-year-olds have a kind of emotional idealism about relationships and about the world that enables them to say, 'No, you lied to me. Goodbye.' When they see wickedness, they walk away.","A story is a kind of biopsy of human life. A story is both local, specific, small, and deep, in a kind of penetrating, layered, and revealing way.","Everything one reads is nourishment of some sort - good food or junk food - and one assumes it all goes in and has its way with your brain cells.","Humor comes from the surprise release of some buried tension.","I love plays. Even bad ones. I like the fact that actual live, breathing people are standing before you in tense situations that you are not personally responsible for.","I want to create something that doesn't exist exactly in the real world, but exists in a kind of parallel to the real world.","You know, as fiction writers, if our instincts are off, we can't pay our bills.","If you look at most women's writing, women writers will describe women differently from the way male writers describe women. The details that go into a woman writer's description of a female character are, perhaps, a little more judgmental. They're looking for certain things, because they know what women do to look a certain way.","I don't sit down to write a funny story. Every single thing I sit down to write is meant to be sad.","Nabokov's adventures in language and style and naked braininess are really unparalleled.","You know, I'm just a very boring, not very funny person in person. I don't feel pressured to be otherwise.","My father was the child of academics and was probably destined to become an academic himself but vetoed that idea. Bailed, dropped out of graduate school and just went to work for an insurance company. But the house was full of books and music and all of that.","I'm surrounded by music; I always was when I was growing up and continue to be. And I love music. And when I imagine a fictional world, I imagine there's music in it for those people, too.","Sometimes I ask myself if writing novels is even respectable.","Rather than a teaching tool, I think a novel is more of a witnessing entity. A witnessing entity? What is that? I just want the reader to step in and experience it as a story.","I usually grow sick of my short-story characters and think, 'I never want to see you again.'","I'm a little harsh. When people say, 'I have writers block. What do you suggest?' I say, 'If you can't write, don't write. No one needs your writing. Don't torture yourself.'","To me, writing is much freer than dancing. With writing, you could do it whenever you wanted. You didn't have to do little exercises and stay in shape. You could have great moments of inspiration that advanced the story. In dance, unless you're going to choreograph things yourself, you're at the service of someone else.","When I was in graduate school, I had a teacher who said to me, 'Women writers should marry somebody who thinks writing is cute. Because if they really realised what writing was, they would run a mile.'","I think women do write politically all the time. Margaret Atwood does; Doris Lessing does.","I always feel that the book I'm working on is my last book.","It was part of being a girl in the '60s that you were creative.","I'm very interested in what people will do for money. Money: it's timeless.","Some people get their books on the best-seller list and then they count the number of weeks, and I just never want to live that way.","I've had nonstop financial problems my whole adult life. It's always been a constant balance, year to year: 'Where's the time? Where's the money?'","If you record the world honestly, there's no way people can stop being funny. A lot of fiction writing doesn't get that idea, as if to acknowledge it would trivialize the story or trivialize human nature, when in fact human nature is reduced and falsified if the comic aspects are not included.","Writing has to be an obsession - it's only for those who say, 'I'm not going to do anything else.'","Literature, of course, is not a contest."],"Lotte Lehmann":["I had hoped you would protest, but please don't argue.","You have always given me more than I gave to you. You were the wings on which I soared.","The music is the shining path over which the poet travels to bring his song to the world.","But to me the actual sound of the words is all important; I feel always that the words complete the music and must never be swallowed up in it."],"Lou Adler":["I never had a particular sound. There was no Lou Adler sound like there's a Phil Spector sound. I always tried to make the records about the artists and their particular sound.","I made an enormous amount of money in the record business as a result of owning so much of what I was doing... I owned all those albums and continued to own my catalog.","In making films, you're dealing with hundreds of people and a crew, but eventually, it's you and an editor, and that part of it, I liked it a lot. The experience on 'Up in Smoke' was great. I really enjoyed it.","When I did 'Tapestry' with Carole King, the record was spare and simple, like a demo. If someone had told me to go back and put horns on it, it would've been all wrong. If you're enthusiastic enough to sign an artist, let them do what got you enthusiastic.","Surf music at the time that I did it wasn't mainstream, nor were the Cheech and Chong albums. The risk comes from having the ability to do something that hadn't been done before that I thought was either interesting as an art form or just should be done.","Johnny Rivers is underestimated as an artist. We had four top 10 singles."],"Lou Barletta":["Thousands of cities in America are crying out for relief from the burden of illegal immigration. Small towns like mine can no longer wait for Washington.","I've been a voice for many people.","I saw my city gripped by fear. Because of violent acts committed by illegal aliens, my residents were afraid to shop - or even drive - on certain streets.","The federal government has failed us, so we, the elected officials of small-town America, are getting tough with illegal immigration.","I'm Lou Barletta, and I'm a small town defender.","Big government doesn't work! It just doesn't work!","In a city that is barely getting by with its small budget, something like illegal immigration can be the difference from being able to provide the level of public service that people expect.","Mayors do not have that authority to pick and choose what laws they're going to enforce.","I just want to keep America safe. Who could be against that?","People know that I'm going to do what's right.","I love the new legal immigrants; they want their kids to be safe just like I do."],"Lou Boudreau":["Playing shortstop is 75 to 80 percent anticipation, knowing the hitter and the pitch being thrown.","I thank the Lord for having the kind of a career that doesn't happen very often to an individual. A lot of times when I was playing, I pinched myself to see if it was really me and if it was really happening. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't change anything.","There's so much attached to playing shortstop that you lose your concentration on hitting, unless you're a natural hitter. There's so much to think about in the field, you don't have time to think about what you did at the plate last time. 'How did he get me out?'","The shortstop is a perfectly conditioned athlete. You're running out on relays all the time. You're covering second base. On every pitch, you're moving.","The overall thinking of the shortstop covers the overall context of the ballgame. You have to know the count they'll hit-and-run on. You're thinking of the speed, not only of the runner at first base, but the runner at the plate. You have to know how fast the pitcher is on a particular day.","As far as sleeping goes, you're up and ready to go at six in the morning. Spring training was always a combination of relaxing and working, and I missed that quite a bit. I missed being around the ball field. A baseball. A bat. The smell of the uniform, you might say. Talking baseball. Seeing opponents as well as the Cubs.","Yeah, I miss it. You don't just break off a friendship you've had with a sport, and with all those you've met all over the country. We've got some friends, some very close friends, and you just sit back and think how fortunate you were having a career like that. And, actually, there's nothing in the game of baseball that hasn't happened to me."],"Lou Brock":["We have to make some radical move to get the attention of everyone. Cheaters can't win and steroids has put us in the position that it's OK to cheat.","Show me a guy who's afraid to look bad, and I'll show you a guy you can beat every time.","You can't be afraid to make errors! You can't be afraid to be naked before the crowd, because no one can ever master the game of baseball, or conquer it. You can only challenge it.","The stiffer the penalty, the greater the message is sent.","When I was a kid, I used to imagine animals running under my bed. I told my dad, and he solved the problem quickly. He cut the legs off the bed.","Jim Crow was king... and I heard a game in which Jackie Robinson was playing, and I felt pride in being alive.","I don't think about goals and records. Competition is what keeps me playing.","If you're successful in what you do over a period of time, you'll start approaching records, but that's not what you're playing for. You're playing to challenge and be challenged.","The baseball held was my fantasy of what life offered.","Your bat is your life. It's your weapon. You don't want to go into battle with anything that feels less than perfect.","They will look at my career as the guy who gave it all but at the same time did it with integrity. That's what we all aim for - the respect of the game as well as the honesty that's played a part of that game.","I had a job on college campus. I lost that job, but on my way home I heard an inner voice that said go out for the baseball team. I was a walk-on, and I was actually petrified as a walk-on because you're not an athlete.","I was not in the church, but we claim, like so many people, 'Yeah, I grew up in the church.' Well yeah, I grew up in the church and went to church, but I knew nothing about the Lord. I had no idea what it meant about walking in faith.","You can't hide God in you. God was not meant to become part of you, and you hide out in the closet. I don't think He wanted that. I think He wanted people to see the Christ in you that reflects Him.","If I had any interest in coming back to baseball, it would be as a general manager and not as a manager.","Some players tell me that since retiring they've had the urge to go somewhere every three days. To satisfy that urge, they may even jump in the car and drive around the block.","There is a definite loneliness in the game. Most people stay away from you since they think they're intruding upon your time. And after the ball game, when it's 11 o'clock and you want to eat dinner some place, the restaurants are closed.","Stealing bases was put to me almost as a prerequisite for staying in the game. They didn't give me a handbook on how to do it; they said do it. Under those conditions you go out and develop your own handbook."],"Lou Costello":["A husband is what's left of a sweetheart after the nerve has been killed.","That was the best ice cream soda I ever tasted."],"Lou Diamond Phillips":["Approach every film with the same enthusiasm, regardless of its budget.","It's easier to stay in shape than to fluctuate.","Simply surviving in this business is a feat.","Sometimes I only hope to make a good popcorn movie.","Although a lot of pain for a little screen time; Shaving legs, waxing eyebrows, high heels, trying to put on a bra, losing weight because women's clothes are SO revealing - Ladies you have my respect.","Hollywood will put you in a box, so to speak. Some people will have seen you in 'La Bamba' or another dramatic film and think, 'Okay, that's what Lou does.' But they don't really have an idea of the range or diversity that I can bring to a project.","Sidney Poitier, who is class personified, said: 'Lou, you're a leading man because you're a good actor.' Brought tears to my eyes.","I'm an actor first and foremost; it's my first love and passion."],"Lou Dobbs":["I'm saying to you that one of the great characteristics of the great American, the American people, is our historic ability to be straightforward, plainspoken, say what we mean, and mean what we say.","I just can't imagine anyone in the United States military who would not understand the distinction between a jihadist and a radical Islamist and Muslims. I think that is snobbery from elitists. It goes to the issue, it seems to me, of an orthodoxy, a political correctness that has infiltrated the U.S. Army.","The United States appears to be a debtor nation in perpetuity.","When we become immobilized by our own inability to deal directly with what is a commonly perceived truth and reality, we are in trouble as a nation."],"Lou Doillon":["I hate short hair on men - the 'real' man is something I don't know. My dad was always playing with hairbands, making rings, while the women were wearing jeans, white T-shirts and Converse. That was the uniform at home.","If Rihanna stripped it all down morally rather than with her clothes, perhaps we'd get closer to Nina Simone. She's talented, but all we want is to sing the truth. If Britney Spears was to sing closer to her heart, she might have been the new Bobby Gentry or Dolly Parton.","The silhouette is the most important thing in clothes. Every French girl knows that. High-waisted trousers give you long legs and a pretty bum which, after all, is what we all want.","What I realized is that the desire for making 'Places' came from the fact that I've got this strange situation with having been born in the glitter, born on the other side of the mirror that everyone fantasizes about.","I was raised by muses. Women who had men in awe of them and who wrote them movies and wrote them music.","I always have lipstick, and use the same lipstick for my cheeks as blush, so that it looks very natural. It's a good trick I learned from my mother. I like NYX or MAC because they have a lot of pigment and they're matte.","My mother taught me to wash my hair as little as possible, and to rinse it with Coke before a shoot for a sexy, tousled look.","My mother is old-fashioned; she raised us like girls from a 19th-century book. My sisters and I are known for being the most polite girls in France. My mother wanted us to be like royalty: never ever will you be caught being rude, or superficial or being a star or whatever.","The whole point of art school is that you're going to be able to have nudes all day long and a teacher who is there to move you. It's great. I did a tiny bit in the one school in Paris, and it was wonderful because you'd have a nude taking a crazy position, and you'd have 10 seconds to do a drawing. Then you'd do a one-minute drawing.","I always lived with guitarists. When they would leave, I would just pick up their acoustic guitars and start doing finger picking and write.","I have a huge scarf from Hermes that I bought the day I signed my record deal. I had never had an Hermes scarf. And I ran to buy one, thinking, 'Now, this is a symbol, I need one, I need an Hermes scarf,' which actually now I'm quite embarrassed about. Most of the time I twist it so much that no one notices it, and just bundle it around me.","I've always found that fashion is, first of all, mainly for yourself. So my two icons are, on one side, Little Edie from 'Grey Gardens' and, of course, like all my generation, I'm influenced by Kate Moss.","With fashion, my mother was an icon, but she never lived it in the sense that she was never obsessed with fashion. When I was a young girl, my sister wasn't doing fashion, so I started fashion thinking, 'I'm going to do something that they haven't done yet.' That was my silly scheme at the time.","My mother always spoke to me in English, so it's technically my maternal language, and it became a kind of private language - I was happy that I could speak in English to my mum and the majority of people wouldn't understand it.","The whole process of music for me is something absolutely honest and really naked and bare, so I never forced myself to write in French.","I'm a very compulsive person, so I spend most of my time drawing or writing my diary, patching things up and carving bits of wood - I've carved two of my guitars.","I like costumes. I am always dressing up - I'm very English like that.","The English and Japanese are the most inventive dressers in the world, but French girls are the most beautiful. I am still always amazed by the style of French girls, and the only reason is that they dress according to themselves and not according to fashion. They know what suits them.","There is an image of me in France that is a long stretch from who I really am. I read about this girl who lives in grand hotels and has affairs with American actors - I don't recognise this girl at all. Sometimes it makes me depressed. Sometimes it makes me laugh. Sometimes I think, 'Gosh, that sounds nice, I'd love to be that girl.'","I always loved singing, but I thought it was like drawing - just something you do in your own little corner to calm yourself down. But when my friend, the French songwriter Etienne Daho, listened to my songs, he was so moved that told me that I had to do a demo, share them with the world.","Luckily, I was raised by a kind of gypsy family, which is why I always get along better with people who worked in circuses than with kids of other actors. My mom was so carefree with us in a beautiful way. We were used to sleeping anywhere.","I was such a tomboy. I had absolutely no bosom, and I wore my hair really short - shaved, like a boy.","'Blanche' opened a new door for me without really making me more famous. 'Blanche' was a risk, but that is the only thing that excites me in this profession. The knowledge that I am an actress who takes risks lifts my soul.","In a modern world where a majority of women say, 'I don't need you, I've got my money, I've got my stuff,' I say, 'I desperately need men.' My whole album is a tribute to men. It takes a man in me to tell you that I'm on my knees for men.","I'm in my father's car at age 9 or 10 crying to Leonard Cohen's 'Famous Blue Raincoat,' thinking that you could write nearly a love letter to a man who betrayed you by having an affair with your wife. I was thinking how wonderful and pure music can be for explaining situations.","The more you're writing absolutely honestly, and absolutely bare of intention - even if it feels absolutely personal and small because it's at your own scale - other people relate to it much more.","In England, you laugh at yourselves; in France, we laugh at others.","I was kind of ashamed of my bourgeois family as a teenager, I guess - I had dreadlocks, shopped in thrift stores and pretended I had no money. At that time, I would have spat on a girl who was buying Yves Saint Laurent.","I've always had a strange acting life. I'm the daughter of a director, and a very French, typical director who fell in love with every single one of his actresses. And that's also something that's kind of normal in the acting business, because everything is based on desire, one way or the other.","I love acting; I love movie sets and movies, but, at the same time, there's something about the position of women in that world that frightens me a lot. I find it nearly inhuman to be an actress.","I have a strong and strange character, and I've rarely met directors who knew what to do with this character. One of the few who did was my father, and in the theatre, Arthur Nauzyciel.","I listen to a variety of music. The only common point is strong lyrics; I'm more obsessed with lyrics than music. I need to hear a form of truth, and if it's a hard truth, even better.","I picked up the guitar very late, in a very pagan way - I didn't know how to play, but I knew I had to. I drew and I had a diary, but it wasn't enough; I needed to express more. As soon as I learned two notes, I started to tell a story, which is why, I guess, my music resembles blues or folk.","I try to not listen to all the girls I admire musically - like Nina Simone - just so I don't find myself imitating them, even if it's subconsciously.","I'm a bit of a contrarian, so I like the idea of going on stage without makeup, without the hair being done, in the jeans and shirt I've been wearing all day. At first that was an issue, because I didn't want to be disrespectful.","Home has always been wherever I am. I'm not very attached to walls - or people, for that matter - so I've always loved travelling around. A book in my back pocket, a diary, and a pen is all I need to call any place home.","To be an actor is to be ambiguous in every form, which is a very hard way to live. You represent desire: the desire of the director and the desire of the audience, even if it's a subconscious desire. If a director is to work with you for two months, he must be in love with you in some way or another.","My mission is to get on the stage and say, 'Listen, I'm a woman, I'm free, I'm a mother, I'm a lover, I'm a friend; I'm shattered by men most of the time, but I'll keep falling in love with them because it's the most thrilling thing in the world; that's what makes me human.'","There was this really rock n' roll guy who was very obviously dragged to my concert by his girlfriend. He had tattoos all over, and he was wearing a Metallica T-shirt. He came up to me said it was one of his favorite concerts because I had reached for his heart and dragged it out and put it in front of his face.","Singing is the rawest thing. Having been naked in films or naked in photo shoots, it's nothing compared to singing. It's absolute nakedness. You are stripped bare! It's very strange. Acting seems much easier, in fact, because you are putting on a costume - whereas here, you are taking everything off.","The French press can be very harsh, and the one thing they can't bear is multi-tasking. They despise it to the highest degree, so from the age of five I've been taught that if I did two things at the same time, it meant I didn't know how to do one. It's an obsession that they have.","As a little girl, I had huge fantasies about music.","My mum is deeply, deeply a man's woman, a man's muse. Maybe because I'm a kid from the '80s, I'm a bit more dominant. I wanted to be the muse and the director also. I wanted to be the man and the woman.","It took me so long to get to the music, where that was what I wanted to do all my life. It took me so long to realise that it wasn't really movies that I wanted to do, but to be on stage singing.","I think I was pretty much hated in France. The French press ignored me. There was a movement when the children of celebrities faced strong animosity.","As an actress, you're part of what the director is creating, and as a model, you're representing a designer's vision.","I was always the funny-looking girl. I couldn't compete with the Brazilian girls. My nose is off, my ears are too big. But I think it's my personality that these designers were drawn to."],"Lou Duva":["I love what I'm doing. It's my life. When it's time to go, I'll probably be fighting to get out of the casket. I'll be yelling at the priest instead of a referee.","Why would anyone expect Tyson to come out smarter? He went to prison for four years, not Princeton.","It's hard to start from the bottom.","I'm always going back to one thing - my family... It's my family, my religion, my fighters. Put them in any order you want."],"Lou Ferrigno":["The Hulk was a unique character because of his strength and power. He doesn't have a costume like Spiderman or like Superman - The Hulk is more visual. His passion and his strength, that is what separates him from anything else.","The truth is, I've been the Hulk my whole life.","To be a champion you must act like one, act like a champion.","Bodybuilding saved my life because I overcame the nerd stage. I got picked on. I was fascinated with power, and then I decided to take that direction because I knew that would make me feel good about myself.","I have a lot of anger about my childhood - being hard of hearing and my relationship with my father.","The attitude is very important. Because, your behavior radiates how you feel.","Close to birth... I lost, like, 80 percent of my hearing, and I had difficulty speaking.","You are going to have bad days and have good days.","Computers can bully us. A slow and unreliable system will bring even the toughest soul to their knees as they find themselves completely defenseless against the erratic whims of their rogue machine.","There is no excuse for anyone not to train three times a week. People want to look fat. Anyone can change their mind if they want to. It's all about motivation.","I have a tremendous passion for fitness, I love challenges and I am a very driven guy.","I know right a way there's a person that's very insecure; that he's trying to out do me. And, ah, like I was saying before, if you give one-hundred percent of your best, and you may have fault, but there is nothing you can do, because you gave one-hundred percent.","It's funny how sometimes how the public some people think I was born like this. That I maybe I sleep and I do big muscle, but its a lot of work to look like this and to be in this kind of condition.","I never think about losing.","If you are going to try and hide something, sooner or later people are going to find out.","'The Hulk' was the beginning of me, a platform as an actor to grow.","I don't think anybody else can play the Hulk like I could. I was able to show emotions even with all of the makeup. I don't think it can be duplicated.","I like to be home every night with my family.","I think Eric Bana would be a good Superman. He's got that look. I think he'd be a great Superman.","I train a lot of people on the side as a personal trainer, but I still work out myself to keep in great shape.","When I work out, I wear two in-the-ear hearing aids for comfort, and then I wear the behind-the-ears for my day-to-day non-physical activities, when I need maximum hearing and to communicate with people and do interviews!","Anytime I do a movie or a TV show, I make them aware of my hearing loss at the beginning, and that makes it much easier for all of us to communicate and get the job done.","I'm a Republican. I may go into politics myself.","I've been involved with law enforcement for some time. My father was in law enforcement. I went through the training for Homeland Security. I enjoy it very much.","I have always had an ambition to do 'Dancing with the Stars.'","I love doing comedy. I did comedy for seven years on 'The King of Queens.'","I loved doing the 'King of Queens', I have never had so much fun doing a show. People got to see a different side of me.","I did a movie 'I Love You, Man' and it got great reviews; it was very enjoyable.","I have the largest collection of Hulk memorabilia in the world - everything from toilet paper, wallpaper, bicycles - all boxed up at my house in Northern California. I've had it for so long, I think it might be time to sell it.","I've done the voice for the Hulk for the animated cartoon.","Pumping iron is not what it used to be. It doesn't have the personality it used to. When we started out, people who worked out had nothing. Now there is so much money involved; back then it was the love of the sport. We appreciated what we have. Today it's not the same.","Most pro bodybuilders have bad relationships with their fathers. We want to prove something."],"Lou Gehrig":["I love to win; but I love to lose almost as much. I love the thrill of victory, and I also love the challenge of defeat.","When you have a wonderful mother-in-law who takes sides with you in squabbles with her own daughter - that's something.","I might have had a tough break; but I have an awful lot to live for.","There is no room in baseball for discrimination. It is our national pastime and a game for all.","I'm not a headline guy. I know that as long as I was following Ruth to the plate I could have stood on my head and no one would have known the difference.","In the beginning I used to make one terrible play a game. Then I got so I'd make one a week and finally I'd pull a bad one about once a month. Now, I'm trying to keep it down to one a season.","The ballplayer who loses his head, who can't keep his cool, is worse than no ballplayer at all.","When you have a wife who has been a tower of strength and shown more courage than you dreamed existed - that's the finest I know.","When you have a father and a mother who work all their lives so you can have an education and build your body - it's a blessing.","What are you going to do? Admit to yourself that the pitchers have you on the point of surrender? You can't do that. You must make yourself think that the pitchers are just as good as they always have been or just as bad."],"Lou Gramm":["The future is finally something that we can now put into focus.","Five years ago we were working on a new album when my health began failing.","I went in for an operation to remove a brain tumor.","For the next three plus years, I really was not in creative shape. That part of my brain was not functioning.","When we finish this tour we are going to begin writing and go into the studio to hopefully have a brand new Foreigner album out in early spring next year. This will be the first Foreigner album out in about ten years.","You have to work with the ideas and give them a little push.","If you had a record company believing in you enough to cut an album then you had better have the ability to work the album on the road.","After the accident Black Sheep was pretty much at an end.","I had my own musical ideas that Mick helped me with as well.","It was kind of fun being the headliners.","Without getting real personal, we liked our bass player Ed. He was a great guy and he was a good bass player but his playing was suited for a different style of band.","It was really terrific but Foreigner was nothing like Yes and that style did not suit our music.","I am starting to look like and perform like the Lou that I used to be.","Beginning to create again was something that I took for granted but I never will take it for granted again.","Regardless what technology is, I like analog too.","I was a drummer, and I did a little singing too.","It's only in the seventies that I put the sticks down and I moved to the front.","A lot of times Mick will play me different things, or I'll listen to a cassette, and out of twenty ideas or whatever, I'll find two or three that are just blowing me away, and we'll start working on them right away.","I think we are looked upon as a veteran band.","Maybe some people have written us off, but I think the new music today has also invigorated us.","I gave my life to Christ about 1991.","I find singing some of Foreigner's older songs are a little reckless and not exactly who I am now.","As long as I continue to put forth who I am and what I believe, than I think it all balances out.","We put out press releases to tell people what had happened to me and that I had a large weight gain but a lot of people still didn't know. The ones that didn't know were floored. That was a real humbling experience for me.","It was a little at a time but I broke out my Walkman and my lyric pad and started writing.","In those days it was pretty cut and dry. If you had a record company believing in you enough to cut an album then you had better have the ability to work the album on the road.","I opted out of the band.","We still play Foreigner songs. I play the songs that I was involved in writing.","We play some of my stuff and we play some Beatle covers.","I go to the gym five days a week and I have a personal trainer. I am on a strict diet, which is kind of hard to keep up with on the road, but I stick to it as well as I can."],"Lou Harrison":["We get more dangerous as we accumulate knowledge, and that's both a sadness and something to control, try to learn to live with, make terms with.","Three days in a city now and I'm quite flipped. There's too much noise. I just can't do with it.","I don't want to wear my compositional tools on my sleeve."],"Lou Henry Hoover":["I was a Scout years ago, before the movement started, when my father took me fishing, camping and hunting. Then I was sorry that more girls could not have what I had. When I learned of the movement, I thought, here is what I always wanted other girls to have.","The independent girl is a person before whose wrath only the most rash dare stand, and, they, it must be confessed, with much fear and trembling.","The independent girl is truly of quite modern origin, and usually is a most bewitching little piece of humanity.","I majored in geology in college but have majored in Herbert Hoover ever since."],"Lou Holtz":["I follow three rules: Do the right thing, do the best you can, and always show people you care.","Virtually nothing is impossible in this world if you just put your mind to it and maintain a positive attitude.","Ability is what you're capable of doing. Motivation determines what you do. Attitude determines how well you do it.","Winners embrace hard work. They love the discipline of it, the trade-off they're making to win. Losers, on the other hand, see it as punishment. And that's the difference.","Do right. Do your best. Treat others as you want to be treated.","Nothing on this earth is standing still. It's either growing or it's dying. No matter if it's a tree or a human being.","Life is ten percent what happens to you and ninety percent how you respond to it.","Everyone goes through adversity in life, but what matters is how you learn from it.","You aren't going to find anybody that's going to be successful without making a sacrifice and without perseverance.","Show me someone who has done something worthwhile, and I'll show you someone who has overcome adversity.","It's not the load that breaks you down, it's the way you carry it.","Successful people will always tell you you can do something. It's the people who have never accomplished anything who will always discourage you from trying to achieve excellent things.","I never learn anything talking. I only learn things when I ask questions.","Sacrifice, discipline and prayer are essential. We gain strength through God's word. We receive grace from the sacrament. And when we fumble due to sin - and it's gonna happen - confession puts us back on the field.","If what you did yesterday seems big, you haven't done anything today.","I do know this: God does answer your prayers, but it's not always in the way you expect. God knows what's best for us, though, so there's no need to worry when things don't go how we originally wanted them to go.","We were at a beach one summer, and I had a bathing suit on. My wife looked at me and said: 'Boy, you are skinny, aren't you?' I said: 'Honey, I'd like to remind you that it was minor defects like this that kept me from getting a better wife.'","It is a fine thing to have ability, but the ability to discover ability in others is the true test.","Our cellar home had a kitchen and a combination bedroom and half bath, which meant we had a sink next to the bed. We had no refrigerator, no shower or tub, and no privacy. My parents shared the bedroom with my sister and me.","Motivation is simple. You eliminate those who are not motivated.","In the successful organization, no detail is too small to escape close attention.","The problem with having a sense of humor is often that people you use it on aren't in a very good mood.","We have an obligation to help people that cannot help themselves. The mentally retarded, the physically retarded, et cetera.","I think that everybody needs four things in life. Everybody needs something to do regardless of age. Everybody needs someone to love. Everybody needs something to hope for, and, of course, everybody needs someone to believe in.","How you respond to the challenge in the second half will determine what you become after the game, whether you are a winner or a loser.","God answers prayers, but he doesn't always answer it your way.","You don't go to Notre Dame to learn something; you go to Notre Dame to be somebody.","How do you know what it's like to be stupid if you've never been smart?","My first assistant-coaching job in football was at William & Mary in 1961. The pay wasn't much, so to get $300 more per year, I agreed to coach the golf team. I didn't even know how to keep score, and really, my main job was not to wreck the van on the way to tournaments.","As a coach, one thing that used to frustrate me was one player would make a bad decision, and that's all you would read about in the papers all over the country. We have so many athletes do so many wonderful things for other people, and you never read about it.","The key to winning is choosing to do God's will and loving others with all you've got.","Don't tell your problems to people: eighty percent don't care; and the other twenty percent are glad you have them.","No one has ever drowned in sweat.","I was born January 6, 1937, eight years after Wall Street crashed and two years before John Steinbeck published The Grapes of Wrath, his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the plight of a family during the Great Depression.","I can't believe that God put us on this earth to be ordinary.","I think life is a matter of choices and that wherever we are, good or bad, is because of choices we make.","If you burn your neighbors house down, it doesn't make your house look any better.","You're never as good as everyone tells you when you win, and you're never as bad as they say when you lose.","When I work a game as an analyst, all I do is look at the game like a coach.","In the nineties, everybody wants to talk about their rights and privileges. Twenty-five years ago, people talked about their obligations and responsibilities.","No matter what happens on the field, getting an education makes you a winner.","I believe in the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.","On this team, we're all united in a common goal: to keep my job.","At home I have a copy of the April 21, 1986, issue of 'Sports Illustrated.' I'm on the cover with the blurb, 'Can Lou Do It?' I'd just arrived at Notre Dame, and with spring football underway, I was the focal point of that week's coverage.","You'll never get ahead of anyone as long as you try to get even with him.","The man who complains about the way the ball bounces is likely the one who dropped it.","See, winners embrace hard work.","I truly believe the things Notre Dame stands for.","We can all be successful and make money, but when we die, that ends. But when you are significant is when you help other people be successful. That lasts many a lifetime.","When the bank asks me about my assets, I include my friendship with Regis Philbin.","Had I been a great athlete, I'm not sure I would have even gone into coaching. I may have turned out feeling that my life ended when my athletic career ended, as happens so many times with various athletes.","I think that we have opportunities all around us - sometimes we just don't recognize them.","I give opinions, not advice.","I don't think there's been anything in the game of football in my lifetime that has changed college football more than redshirting.","I have to admit, I sometimes wonder how much more successful I would have been as a coach had it not been for my spending summers on the golf course. I could have watched more film, that's for sure. One advantage Joe Paterno had over me was that he didn't play golf.","When people need love and understanding and support the most is when they deserve it the least.","Don't be a spectator, don't let life pass you by.","I won't accept anything less than the best a player's capable of doing... and he has the right to expect the best that I can do for him and the team!","A lifetime contract for a coach means if you're ahead in the third quarter and moving the ball, they can't fire you.","For victory in life, we've got to keep focused on the goal, and the goal is Heaven.","If you're bored with life - you don't get up every morning with a burning desire to do things - you don't have enough goals.","My philosophy in life is, Decide what you want to do. You have to have something to hope for.","If you try to fight the course, it will beat you.","I think everyone should experience defeat at least once during their career. You learn a lot from it.","I believe that having a spiritual life is so important in everybody's life.","I was raised in a religious environment, and my wife is one of the more religious people that I have ever known.","If Tiger Woods had played football, he would have been a quarterback.","I do think coaches need to get away from the game more, though. It's good for them.","If you look at the history of Notre Dame, if you hire a coach who's been successful at another college program, they're going to be ultra successful at Notre Dame because the talent will always be there.","When I left the University of Notre Dame, I honestly felt I would never coach again.","I feel that God wants me to coach; otherwise, he wouldn't have put the desire in me.","The Sisters of Notre Dame at St. Aloysius Grade School influenced my life tremendously. This was due to the fact that they encouraged you always to make sure that God is the focus of your life, and they didn't allow you to do anything except to the very best of your ability.","When I die, and people realize that I will not be resurrected in three days, they will forget me. That is the way it should be.","Coaching is nothing more than eliminating mistakes before you get fired.","If he's got golf clubs in his truck or a camper in his driveway, I don't hire him.","I look at athletes in all sports and try to picture what kind of football player they'd be, what position they'd play and so on.","When all is said and done, more is said than done.","My first assistant-coaching job in football was at William & Mary in 1961.","All an agent is going to do is buy things for a player, damage his eligibility, and make the player dependent on them.","I don't drink water, haven't drank water in 40 years.","I don't exercise.","I just have an enthusiasm for life.","Notre Dame is the one school that has a national recruiting base, from Florida to Texas to California.","To win a national championship, you've got to be a little lucky.","God looks after children, animals and idiots.","I'm proud to be part of the Dr. Pepper Scholarship Giveaway. It's a great program that gives me the chance to brighten the day for some lucky college students with free tuition.","I've followed Notre Dame football since 1946, when I listened on the radio and Johnny Lujack tackled Doc Blanchard in the open field to preserve a 0-0 tie.","I'm no genius.","The University of Notre Dame does not redshirt, and I endorse that policy completely. I am very much in favor of redshirting, but not at Notre Dame. But there's no doubt about it. It puts us at a huge disadvantage.","All my life, I've been trying to make a hole-in-one. The closest I've come is a bogey.","Football coaches don't have real problems.","My wife doesn't even want to spend 2 hours with me.","I'll assure you this: I will have nothing to do with politics.","After winning, most teams become individuals; most teams become complacent.","I'm an old man, and all my life I've said that Notre Dame should remain independent because it's a national school.","I have no desire at all to become the winningest coach at Notre Dame. The record belongs to Knute Rockne or some other coach in the future.","Whenever you give up something, you must replace it with something.","One thing about me is I try to be honest.","I was raised a Catholic on both sides of the family. I went to a Catholic grade school and thought everybody in the country was Catholic, because that's all I ever was associated with.","I used to pray that God would make me a great athlete, and He never did.","If you made me the national commissioner of football, I'd tell you one thing that I would mandate. The second Saturday in September, we're going to have conference day. Everybody from the SEC plays a Big 12 team. Everybody from the Big Ten is going to play the ACC. Everybody from the Big East is going to play the Pac-10.","In golf, the player, coach and official are rolled into one, and they overlap completely. Golf really is the best microcosm of life - or at least the way life should be.","An agent won't help you get drafted higher, won't make you win more games, and won't make you faster or stronger.","My wife told me if there is any rumors about me, it better be about politics and not about my social life."],"Lou Jiwei":["In 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed, we anticipated that Europe was going to have a very different bailout scheme than the U.S. because of their different political systems and different relationships between the central banks and the fiscal authorities.","Everyone knows the U.S. economy shouldn't be so reliant on consumption. More investments should be made.","There are three main pillars of China's economy. One is export, which is limited by sluggish global demand. The second is investment. In many sectors, there is already too much investment and overcapacity. The third is consumption.","There is a lot of risk in the tech sector.","Infrastructure investment can boost economic growth and employment, and, in fact, it is fiscally neutral.","I need to make money. If I don't, I cannot survive.","Indebted countries can only grow out of their debt troubles through strong economic growth; austerity measures alone cannot work. It is imperative to engage in deep structural reform to spur growth.","Austerity policy without currency devaluation can only hamper economic growth.","The euro zone must strike for a better governance structure, and there is no alternative to that. Euro zone countries must either develop an exit mechanism for troubled members, or it should embrace a closer political union: an effective governance structure that is capable of enforcing rules."],"Lou Rawls":["Music is the greatest communication in the world. Even if people don't understand the language that you're singing in, they still know good music when they hear it.","A lyric has to mean something to me, something that has happened to me.","I might have lived long enough to learn all this in the long haul, but I would have been just another soul taking up time and space for a long spell before I learned.","I've gone the full spectrum - from gospel to blues to jazz to soul to pop - and the public has accepted what I've done through it all. I think it means I've been doing something right at the right time."],"Lou Reed":["I can create a vibe without saying anything, just by being in the room.","Music should come crashing out of your speakers and grab you, and the lyrics should challenge whatever preconceived notions that listener has.","There's only X amount of time. You can do whatever you want with that time. It's your time.","The most important part of my religion is to play guitar.","I wouldn't want to hear Beethoven without beautiful bass, the cellos, the tuba. It's very important. Hip-hop has thunderous bass. And so does Beethoven. If you don't have the bass, it's like being amputated. It's like you have no legs.","Life is like Sanskrit read to a pony.","One chord is fine. Two chords are pushing it. Three chords and you're into jazz.","I've become completely well adjusted to being a cult figure.","I don't like nostalgia unless it's mine.","These are really terribly rough times, and we really should try to be as nice to each other as possible.","How can anybody learn anything from an artwork when the piece of art only reflects the vanity of the artist and not reality?","I don't know anyone actually who does care what a critic says.","Perfect Night has that magic and it has the raw energy that grabs you by the throat.","When I record an album I'm trying to get as close as possible to that perfect moment.","I think life is far too short to concentrate on your past. I rather look into the future.","You can't beat 2 guitars, bass, and drums.","The music is all. People should die for it. People are dying for everything else, so why not the music?","I was a product of Andy Warhol's Factory. All I did was sit there and observe these incredibly talented and creative people who were continually making art, and it was impossible not to be affected by that.","I don't think I'm in any position to call myself a martial artist. I'm a student of the martial arts.","Take a walk on the wild side.","I always believed that I have something important to say and I said it.","In the late '70s I started to search for the perfect sound - whatever that might be, before that I was mainly interested in drugs, insanity and the rock'n'roll lifestyle.","Some even claim that I'm a terror, a dictator and they're right.","I don't mind a repetitive chorus; I mind repetitive verse. I mean, it's the same amount of space. Why would you have only three diamonds if you can have six?","I'll tell ya, I'm a genuinely nice guy. I really am. A real nice guy. But I think I'm temperamental.","I'm writing about real things. Real people. Real characters. You have to believe what I write about is true or you wouldn't pay any attention at all. Sometimes it's me, or a composite of me and other people. Sometimes it's not me at all.","Sound is more than just noise. Ordered sound is music. My life is music.","I always thought martial arts was the most modern choreography we could have right now, and I always wanted to put it to music.","I am very emotionally affected by sound. Sounds are the inexplicable... There is a sound you hear in your head, it's your nerves, or your blood running.","There's a bit of magic in everything, and some loss to even things out.","But I'm also talented and I know when I created something great and Perfect Night is something great, no doubt, no but.","I can concentrate on my art.","I cleaned up my act because otherwise I would have kicked the bucket.","I don't believe in dressing up reality. I don't believe in using makeup to make things look smoother.","I don't like overdubs, never liked them.","I don't really think about what the subject of my next album will be. I just know that I'm going to make another album.","I love Ornette Coleman. I love Don Cherry. I love the way those guys play.","I think it's pretentious to create art just for the sake of stroking the artists ego.","I think that everything happens for a reason, everything happens when it's going to happen.","I'm an artist and that means I can be as egotistical as I want to be.","I'm in this business for too long to be halfhearted about anything.","I'm not joking around when I've said occasionally, trying to learn how to play a D chord properly has been a very big thing for me.","I'm too old to do things by half.","Me, I've concentrated on music pretty much to the exclusion of other things.","Music was what bothered me, what interested me.","My God is rock'n'roll.","One of my rules is: Never listen to your old stuff.","Perfect Night is minimalistic and that's what makes it so forceful.","That's why I survived because I still believe I've got something to say.","The music business doesn't interest me anymore.","You can't ask me to explain the lyrics because I won't do it.","If it has more than three chords, it's jazz.","I tried to give up drugs by drinking.","People think that I work out but it's all t'ai chi.","I'm a humanist.","Raymond Chandler managed to write about L.A. his whole career. Should I keep going writing about New York? Is that what I should be doing? Songwriting doesn't work that way.","The first generation of CDs sounded terrible. Any chance to remaster would make the music sound better than what was already out there.","I don't know what goes on in the crowd. I've had them show up and throw beer cans at me. I caused riots in most of the major cities.","I don't think anybody is anybody else's moral compass. Maybe listening to my music is not the best idea if you live a very constricted life. Or maybe it is.","I don't like the word rock opera, but I'm trying to write on that level that's reserved for plays still, or novels.","It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print.","You're a musician: You play. That's what you do.","I can't do anything I want to. I mean, I can't have my own TV show. I can't have my own movie. But within my little world, nobody tells me what to put on the albums.","You can't beat two guitars, bass, and drums.","Meditation doesn't have to be complicated. What I do is about as simple as you can get. You could just count the beads, one, two, three, with your eyes closed or open, whatever makes you happy.","When I was in college, I had a jazz radio show. I called it 'Excursion on a Wobbly Rail,' after a Cecil Taylor song. I used to run around the Village following Ornette Coleman wherever he played.","For a while, I felt a little self-impelled to write Lou Reed Kind of songs. I should have understood that a Lou Reed song was anything I wanted to write about.","I have no control over the audience. I have no idea what they think. My heart's pure. I can't do anything. I really can't do anything. I don't know what goes on in the crowd.","I wanted to be an actor. That was my real goal. But I wasn't any good at it, so I wrote my own material and acted through that. That's my idea of fun. I get to be all these things in the songs.","I've never been super confident about anything. The work is never as good as it could be."],"Lou Thesz":["Friday was Atlanta. That was fifteen bucks. Once a month, we made a six hundred mile trip from Indianapolis down to Atlanta, and at fifteen dollars, by the time you feed yourself and buy gasoline, you're minus about ten bucks.","I remember things that happened sixty years ago, but if you ask me where I left my car keys five minutes ago, that's sometimes a problem."],"Loudon Wainwright III":["If I had five minutes to live, I don't think I'd be bothered singing a song. I'd be dead, so it won't really matter. I'd have a glass of wine and a cigarette.","When you have a song on the radio your career and your life changes maybe for the better and maybe for the not so good... depending on how it's going that day.","When you start performing, you realize that you have to separate yourself from the pack. So I would never wear bell-bottoms, which everybody else was wearing. I had short hair - and to see a 21-year-old guy walk onstage without longish hair was, in itself, weird. Every entertainer needs a shtick.","Los Angeles, the sun shines a lot, and it's blue, and there's palm trees; it's a bit like Sydney, I guess, but the underbelly is a vicious, mean, cruel, awful place.","I don't claim to be a particularly good father. I'm flawed, let's say. I've certainly been affected by the experience of having kids... trying to be a father, at least. It's an amazing process. It's like songwriting: it's a complete mystery to me. I don't understand it - but I've certainly written about it.","I've been writing about growing old for some time, really from the beginning of my career. It's something I'm apparently hung up about and now that I am old, hopefully I speak about it with some authority.","I love failure. It's stuff that I'm thinking about all the time in my life, so it would make sense to me anyway to write about it.","I think I'm the oldest new Bob Dylan around. I predate Bruce Springsteen, Steve Forbat and John Prine. I was probably the first of the new Bob Dylans.","When you start your career, you have to figure out a way to separate yourself from the pack. So I went for a kind of preppy, psycho-killer look: I had short hair, grey flannel pants, and a button-down shirt. I think it worked, because nobody else was looking that way at that time.","If you're 28 and singing about being over the hill, you're pretending. When you're 67 and singing about it, you know what you're talking about.","I don't think of myself as a folk singer per se, but I really like blues and string-band music. When I started listening to records when I was a teenager, the folk boom was going on.","I always wanted to be an actor, even as a little kid. So I went to drama school in the late '60s at Carnegie Mellon.","I had a hip replacement a couple of years ago. I have a song about that. And why wouldn't you? It strikes me that that was a huge event. It's kind of funny and horrible and interesting, so why wouldn't one write about that?","I have travelled and been pretty much a one man operation for most of my career, and I think it'll continue to be that way.","I know that people don't listen to music much in the way when they'll put on a CD, sit down, have a drink or go on a car journey. People pick and choose and just listen to tracks. But when I make a record, I try to think about it as a 50 minute musical journey, so the mood is very important, as is the sequence of the songs.","I wasn't in a lot of rock and roll bands. I was in jug bands and things when I was in school.","I think I'm great. I mean, I might as well come out and say it. Like most people, I have an ego and I'm in show business, so you have to have kind of a healthy, conflagrated ego to a degree. On the other hand, I'm consumed, like a lot of people, with self-doubt and loathing and guilt.","When my mother died, and when my father died, it's big. Our parents are giants; they're titans of our lives, so of course it's going to be a big deal.","I guess I can be surprised I'm alive. I'm taking a little better care of myself than when I was a young person. My father died when he was 63. My mother made it to 74. My grandparents, God, they were dropping like flies.","When you make a record, you listen to it literally hundreds of times. When it's done and you can't do anything else, I never listen to my records.","The big things in the average person's life are the romances that they have - and then the destruction and loss of them. Parents, siblings, children, the death of parents, family tension... these are monumental things. They struck me as being interesting to write about. I didn't have a very exotic life, but all this stuff happened to me.","I don't write about anything I don't want to write about. I like to think I could write about anything pretty much that I chose to. I have been asked to write songs about specific things, and I've always been able to come up with the goods.","I'm always asked if the songs that I write are therapeutic, and my answer is a quick no. In fact, it could be argued that they exacerbate my neurosis.","When a parent dies, the whole house of cards comes down.","My music comes from country music. Merle Haggard is God, and I do believe that. I'm not too tuned in to country music. I don't know who Brooks and Dunn are. I like Shania Twain, though!","Family life is tough, I'll say that for it. But in my case, I've mined the family. In a sense, I've used it. I've used what happened - the different events, the births of children, birthdays. Connecting, not connecting. Regret, shame, guilt. I mean, they're all in the songs. And love, too, I hasten to add.","It's nice when people say, 'God, I've been listening to you since 1963 or 1985, or whatever.' I appreciate anybody who goes out and buys music these days.","You always want to break away from your parents, and you always think, 'I'm never going to be like that guy.' What I've discovered is you kind of wind up becoming your parents, which is also a cliche in itself. My father, despite the fact that he's been dead for over 25 years, he's been a huge influence on me.","I've never really suffered complete and utter writer's block, really. I equate it with sex: in the beginning of my career, I was writing five songs a week; now, I occasionally write a song. But it's an exciting moment when it happens!","I was a smoker for years. Occasionally I slip and have a cigarette. Remarkably, my voice has held up. I'm grateful, obviously. But I don't gargle with honey and ground-up bird eggs. I have no secrets.","As it turns out, three of my four kids are professional singers. And they're really interesting, good singers.","I hated the idea that I would be like my father. Which is one of the reasons I decided I didn't want to be a writer and wanted to be an actor instead. I wanted to go in a total different direction. But, of course, I ended up being a writer anyway."],"Louie Anderson":["I felt ashamed for what I had done. I don't have any excuses. I did what I did. I take full responsibility for myself and my actions. I wouldn't pawn this off on anybody. I'm sorry it happened. And I hurt people.","Minnesotans really think they run the whole world, I love that.","All great comedians make me laugh, but people make me laugh more.","I had been asking the universe and God to send me a way for me to help me. Show business has been so wonderful to me, and it came in the form of that. It's just so funny how things come into your life, and if you take a chance on them, it might give you a brand new life.","Dr. Phil was very helpful and caring. I believe he helped all of us there and watching how to better relate, understand, and communicate with our families and loved ones. Dr. Phil recommended reading my new book.","I really try to have fun. If I don't have fun, you won't have fun. That's what my gift is: to relieve people from a little of the pain and comfort in their lives by allowing my comedy to distract them. A good laugh is almost as good as any doctor visit.","I was with a famous comedian when a young fan walked up and asked for an autograph. The comedian blew him off. I'll never forget the look on the young boy's face. He was devastated.","A real estate closer. Oh, what's that? I'm a real estate opener. What is a real estate closer? You mean at the end where you've got to sign all those papers?","I have about 1,000 hours of myself on tape in a vault in Los Angeles. But I also have a photographic memory about my jokes, because they're really about me; they're my stories.","We were on welfare when we were kids. Thanks for reminding me of that.","You have to be funny about it and honest about it. You can't leave yourself out of that mix. You have to be honest enough to say, I'm that messed-up one in the family.","We all think we're going to get out of debt.","I've been in Vegas. That's where you get into the money thing. Boy, you get greedy in Vegas, you know. That's the only place that you can bet $25, get it up to $500 and refuse to quit.","I have a very warm spot in my heart for Vegas.","I started a big part of my career in Vegas.","I'm a 7 o'clock act. My people want to go to a show, a dinner and then go home and go to bed.","I can't stay long; I'm in between meals.","If I have food in the house and I'm laying in bed, I go, 'I bet that Captain Crunch is lonely in the cupboard.'","You can't open anything after your 50. You have to wait 'til people stop by the house. 'Oh my God, I'm glad you're here.'","When I say, 'I can't stay long, I'm in-between meals,' that plays differently on the radio than it does in person. So I have to pick material that works because the words are funny, not just because of the images.","Well, isn't every successful person in every family the bankbook?","I was 10th of 11 kids in an alcoholic, abusive, poor family. We all want things that we can't have. And I found comedy.","I would trade everything I have to have had a happier childhood.","Everybody wanted to make it. One guy makes it. In a family when one guy makes it... 'Hey ain't you going to help us out?'","I was kind of a Rickles comic to begin with. I was caustic, and I was abusive and mean to the audience.","One time, I came off stage and a guy named Roman Decare, God rest his soul, he was a comic. 'Louie, if you do that family stuff, and you're a clean comic on stage, you'll become famous.' And, for some reason, a switch clicked, and I started doing the family stuff, and it became a giant part of my life.","I think I have always tried to connect my comedy to my art.","Everyone always comes to one point in their life as an artist where you can either let your heart guide you or your ego.","I'm at 23 feet, diving into 17 feet of water. I'm over 400 pounds. Who doesn't want to see that? I do. I'm always shocked that I can do it."],"Louie Gohmert":["Most people give Kennedy a passing grade, a good grade on the Cuban Missile Crisis handling, but what they don't realize, if he had had strength, if he had showed strength before, there would never have been a Cuban Missile Crisis.","I had a lot of friends in high school who said, 'Louie, I don't care what the government does as long as they leave me alone.' Well, guess what, when you don't care what the government does, it does not leave you alone.","We've got some people who think Shariah law oughta be the law of the land, forget the Constitution. But the guns are there, the Second Amendment is there, to make sure all of the rest of the amendments are followed.","Socialism and communism fall of their own weight because, as Margaret Thatcher said, you run out of other people's money. Because socialized medicine never falls of its own weight because you put people on lists, and they die waiting to get the treatment and care. So you don't go broke.","I don't care what gender someone is, or what race they are. Those things don't matter to me.","Whether you're president or speaker, if you're wrong, we need to stand up and point it out. That's what Martin Luther King had talked about: being judged by the content of our character and not the color of our skin. So some of us pounded away on some of the ridiculous policies of Pelosi - and lo and behold, over time, the public began to see.","It's OK to burn a Bible, that's OK. OK to burn a flag, OK, that's all right. But just, you know, for heaven's sake, don't say anything that might offend someone of the Islamic religion.","I was an exchange student for a summer, and most of that summer was in Ukraine. I used to say 'the Ukraine' until I was there, and one of the Ukrainian college students I got to be good friends with, he said, 'Do you say I'm going back to the Texas,' and I said, 'No.' He said, 'We don't say we're going back to the Ukraine, either.'","Back in East Texas, all three networks have stations in my hometown of Tyler, and for a town that small, 85,000, to have all three networks, they all have their own news programs, six and 10, and they're always looking for news. Back when I was a judge, they were constantly coming to the courthouse and asking for comments.","There's no statute of limitations on doing what's right.","Anyone who thinks you can pay $3,100 to the federal government and thinks you can get that money back completely in services - like I said - he may go to M-I-T but he is an N-U-T.","So the good news is, if you're unemployed and you go to apply for a job and you're not hired for that job, see a lawyer - you may be able to file for a claim because you were discriminated against because you were unemployed.","After Nancy Pelosi became Speaker, we were told, 'She's the first female speaker of the House, so whether we like it or not, we've got to handle this with kid gloves. Don't go after Speaker Pelosi. You can go after other people, but you'll be branded as mean and evil if you go after the first female Speaker of the House.'","There are consequences if you stand up for what you believe. Heck, you might - you might lose your sponsors if you're a talk show host; or if you're running for office, you know, people not give to you or people might not vote for you.","Every time anybody in Washington talks about legal status, amnesty, anything of that nature, it becomes a magnet that lures people in quickly into the United States.","When Obamacare actually kicked in, just as we knew, if you liked your insurance, as I did - I had a health savings account - then I wasn't going to be able to keep it because it doesn't meet the requirements.","The dirty little secret on Wall Street: Eighty percent of the Wall Street executives' and their spouses' donations go to Democrats. It's like they've got some kind of little sweet deal, where we'll call you fat cats and demean you and stuff, but you will get richer than your wildest dreams.","Ms. Clinton, like the Obama administration more broadly, believes that appeasing Islamists... promotes peace and stability.","Benefit your friends; make sure your enemies suffer from being your enemies.","I'd be all for everybody keeping their sidearms if they're in the military and on a military installation. That's something we need to get back to.","I think it's time... that we reform Congress to the point where all public assistance comes in one single committee. One area where all public assistance can be located, and it will be easy to see all the duplications, all the waste, so much easier to see areas where fraud is running rampant.","It was no accident that just minutes after Israel became a nation, the United States... became the first nation in the world to recognize what was prophesized throughout the Old Testament about Israel returning after its absence.","It began to really eat away with me that in the '60s the federal government, desiring to help poor moms who were dealing with deadbeat dads, decided, 'We'll help: we'll give a check for every child you can have out of wedlock.'","I was a chief justice. And before that, I was a district court judge, handled major felonies, including capital murder cases; and I handled major civil litigation.","When people say - 'Well, do you miss being a judge since you're in Congress,' I go - 'Only when I want people to sit down and shut up.'","If nothing else came out of all of this debacle over Obamacare, one thing that should is a class-action lawsuit against the University of Chicago Law School for people that had Obama as their constitutional law professor.","It is true what is said in Washington - 'No matter how cynical you get, it's never enough to catch up.'","It does not help when an administration, in response to American attacks on American soil and American individuals, the administration ends up asking Americans to give up their First Amendment rights for which our service members are fighting.","We see people in the Middle East begin to have dreams of new Ottoman Empire where everyone will be subjected to some of what we've seen happen in those countries where we helped bring about an Arab Spring that's turned into a Winter Nightmare.","I know a few expressions. I know what Hilary Clinton basically says in Russian when you translate her into Russian over and over and over is, 'izvinite pozhaluista.' That's, 'excuse me please, excuse me please.' Let's reset things. That's not the way you deal with folks. You show strength if you made a mistake.","The truth is that anyone... that wants to subvert our Constitution to Shariah Law is an enemy of the United States.","You spend a couple million dollars running for Congress, people get tired of seeing your face.","I like to travel in jeans because I don't want to wallow around in my suit, you know? They cost too much. Jeans are comfortable.","You wonder, how could socialists, true socialists work with Islamists? Because if those Islamists take over, the first thing they're going to do is kill the socialists.","I think TARP was the most defining vote since I've been in Congress. It was wrong. You don't nationalize private - it was wrong. It desensitized people to what $700 billion was, which opened the door for a $900 million stimulus, for Obamacare, for all these things. It was wrong. It broke my heart.","We've got the NSA getting logs of every call you make. The IRS is weaponized like Richard Nixon could only have dreamed of.","No country has ever fallen while it was truly honoring the god of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.","I feel like God puts things in our lives to help prepare us for the future.","Obamacare, without a single Republican vote, cut $700 billion out of Medicare.","Now, the people that helped get Obama elected, who think Israel is a good idea, need to wake up and tell him they're our friends, let's preserve them. And then it would happen. Because that's the only kind of thing he responds to. But he throws our friends under the bus and rewards our enemies.","We give the military money, it ought to be to kick rears, break things, and come home.","There is no clear place to draw the line once you eliminate the traditional marriage, and it's the same once you start putting limits on what guns can be used, then it's just really easy to have laws that make them all illegal."],"Louie Schwartzberg":["Nature's beauty is a gift that cultivates appreciation and gratitude.","Metamorphosis has always been the greatest symbol of change for poets and artists. Imagine that you could be a caterpillar one moment and a butterfly the next.","I think we need to do some deep soul searching about what's important in our lives and renew our spirit and our spiritual thinking, whether it's through faith-based religion or just through loving nature or helping your fellow man.","Beauty and seduction, I believe, is nature's tool for survival, because we will protect what we fall in love with.","What is the intersection between technology, art and science? Curiosity and wonder, because it drives us to explore, because we're surrounded by things we can't see.","I grew up in Brooklyn, and my parents were Holocaust survivors, so they never taught me anything about nature, but they taught me a lot about gratitude.","When a dragonfly flutters by, you may not realize, but it's the greatest flier in nature. It can hover, fly backwards, even upside down.","The sound of a million butterflies flapping their wings is indescribable. It's very heavenly.","What I want to do with my filmmaking is help kids experience the truth and wisdom of nature no matter where they are, whether or not they have the opportunity to go to a national park.","I became passionate about nature filmmaking when I graduated from UCLA, and one of the things I always wanted to do was shoot really high quality film, so I got into time-lapse photography - so that means when you shoot a flower, you're shooting, like, one frame every twenty minutes, so that's basically two seconds of a film per day.","I realized that nature had invented reproduction as a mechanism for life to move forward, as a life force that passes right through us and makes us a link in the evolution of life. Rarely seen by the naked eye, this intersection between the animal world and the plant world is truly a magic moment.","When I heard that the bees were in trouble, the fact that they're disappearing and not coming back to the hive, which is a big issue, since a third of the food we eat comes from plants, I figured you couldn't tell the story of the bees without the story of the flowers and how they basically have evolved together for over 150 years.","A third of our food comes from pollinating plants.","I love all of the ecosystems - mountains, deserts, rainforests. They're beautiful, and nature has so many different flavors to it.","We're giants, and we're unaware of things that are too small for us to see.","I like to do films that celebrate life.","I'm Jewish and respect the traditions of Judaism, but through all the time I've spent photographing nature, I also have a deep appreciation for the power of the universe. No, not the power of the universe, but just celebrating life.","I want viewers to see that everything is connected, even the little guys like pollinators and flowers.","Basically, the intersection between the animal world and the plant world is where life regenerates itself over and over, billions of times each day. It's the foundation of life on our planet.","With high-speed cameras, we can do the opposite of time lapse. We can shoot images that are thousands of times faster than our vision. And we can see how nature's ingenious devices work, and perhaps we can even imitate them."],"Louis A. Johnson":["Eighty percent of the problems that beset unification immediately disappeared when the President signed the bill increasing the authority and the responsibility of the Secretary of Defense.","The advance guard in the campaign for peace that America wages today must be the State Department.","This nation can no longer tolerate the autonomous conduct of any single service. A waste of the resources of America in spendthrift defense is an invitation to disaster for America.","In the light of the actual fighting that is now in progress, we have reached the point where the military considerations clearly outweigh the fiscal considerations."],"Louis Adolphe Thiers":["The king reigns but does not govern.","In politics it is necessary to take nothing tragically and everything seriously."],"Louis Agassiz":["I cannot afford to waste my time making money.","The glacier was God's great plough set at work ages ago to grind, furrow, and knead over, as it were, the surface of the earth.","Every scientific truth goes through three states: first, people say it conflicts with the Bible; next, they say it has been discovered before; lastly, they say they always believed it.","Study nature, not books.","The study of Nature is intercourse with the Highest Mind. You should never trifle with Nature.","Facts are stupid until brought into connection with some general law."],"Louis Althusser":["Ideology... is indispensable in any society if men are to be formed, transformed and equipped to respond to the demands of their conditions of existence.","Ideology has very little to do with 'consciousness' - it is profoundly unconscious."],"Louis Aragon":["Light is meaningful only in relation to darkness, and truth presupposes error. It is these mingled opposites which people our life, which make it pungent, intoxicating. We only exist in terms of this conflict, in the zone where black and white clash.","Love is made by two people, in different kinds of solitude. It can be in a crowd, but in an oblivious crowd.","Fear of error which everything recalls to me at every moment of the flight of my ideas, this mania for control, makes men prefer reason's imagination to the imagination of the senses. And yet it is always the imagination alone which is at work.","We know that the nature of genius is to provide idiots with ideas twenty years later.","I demand that my books be judged with utmost severity, by knowledgeable people who know the rules of grammar and of logic, and who will seek beneath the footsteps of my commas the lice of my thought in the head of my style.","There are strange flowers of reason to match each error of the senses.","Of all possible sexual perversions, religion is the only one to have ever been scientifically systematized.","O reason, reason, abstract phantom of the waking state, I had already expelled you from my dreams, now I have reached a point where those dreams are about to become fused with apparent realities: now there is only room here for myself.","Can the knowledge deriving from reason even begin to compare with knowledge perceptible by sense?"],"Louis Armstrong":["Musicians don't retire; they stop when there's no more music in them.","Music is life itself. What would this world be without good music? No matter what kind it is.","I never want to be anything more than I am; what I don't have, I don't need.","If you have to ask what jazz is, you'll never know.","I had a long time admiration for the Jewish people. Especially with their long time of courage, taking so much abuse for so long. I was only seven years old, but I could easily see the ungodly treatment that the white folks were handing the poor Jewish family whom I worked for.","I do believe that my whole success goes back to that time I was arrested as a wayward boy at the age of thirteen. Because then I had to quit running around and began to learn something. Most of all, I began to learn music.","Very few of the men whose names have become great in the early pioneering of jazz and of swing were trained in music at all. They were born musicians: they felt their music and played by ear and memory. That was the way it was with the great Dixieland Five.","I was determined to play my horn against all odds, and I had to sacrifice a whole lot of pleasure to do so.","All music is folk music. I ain't never heard a horse sing a song.","We never did try to get together and to show the younger Negroes such as myself, to try and even to show that he has ambitions - and with just a little encouragement, I could have really done something worthwhile. But instead, we did nothing but let the young upstarts know that they were young and simple, and that was that.","Well, I tell you... the first chorus, I plays the melody. The second chorus, I plays the melody round the melody, and the third chorus, I routines.","There is two kinds of music, the good, and the bad. I play the good kind.","I like kissable lips. A woman's lips must say, 'Come here and kiss me, Pops.'","We all do 'do, re, mi,' but you have got to find the other notes yourself.","What we play is life.","When this ugly gangster told Joe Glaser that he must take the name of Armstrong down, off of the marquee, and it was an 'order from Al Capone,' Mr. Glaser looked this cat straight in the face and told him these words: 'I think that Louis Armstrong is the world's greatest, and this is my place, and I defy anybody to take his name down from there.'","'Cat?' 'Cat' can be anybody from the guy in the gutter to a lawyer, doctor, the biggest man to the lowest man, but if he's in there with a good heart and enjoy the same music together, he's a cat.","I warm up at home. I hit the stage, I'm ready, whether it's rehearsal or anything.","The memory of things gone is important to a jazz musician.","I gathered that those two Big-shot Boys, Joe + Fletcher, just was afraid to let me sing, thinking maybe I'd sort of ruin their reputations with their musical public. They not knowing that I had been singing all of my life. In churches, etc. I had one of the finest All Boys Quartets that ever walked the streets of New Orleans.","There are some people that if they don't know, you can't tell them.","When I play, maybe 'Back o' Town Blues,' I'm thinking about one of the old, low-down moments - when maybe your woman didn't treat you right. That's a hell of a moment when a woman tell you, 'I got another mule in my stall.'","You blows who you is.","When the other kids started calling me nicknames, I knew everything was all right. I have a pretty big mouth, so they hit on that and began calling me Gatemouth or Satchelmouth, and that Satchelmouth has stuck to me all my life, except that now it's been made into 'Satchmo' - 'Satchmo' Armstrong.","The first time I heard Jack Teagarden on the trombone, I had goose pimples all over."],"Louis Auchincloss":["We were not as rich as the Rockefellers or Mellons, but we were rich enough to know how rich they were.","Perfection irritates as well as it attracts, in fiction as in life.","A neurotic can perfectly well be a literary genius, but his greatest danger is always that he will not recognize when he is dull.","With her high pale brow under her faded brown hair, she was like a rock washed clean by years of her husband's absences at conventions, dinners, committee meetings or simply at the office."],"Louis B. Rosenberg":["The reason that fish form schools, birds form flocks, and bees form swarms is that they are smarter together than they would be apart. They don't take a vote; they don't take a poll: they form a system. They are all interactive and make a decision together in real time.","There is a lot of work out there to take people out of the loop in things like medical diagnosis. But if you are taking humans out of the loop, you are in danger of ending up with a very cold form of AI that really has no sense of human interest, human emotions, or human values.","We've been astonished by how good groups working together can predict the outcomes of events.","How does nature amplify the intelligence of groups? It forms swarms.","Politicians have conflicting values but not conflicting knowledge.","Beyond individual intelligence, nature has also cultivated intelligence through swarms. For example, bees, birds and fish act in a more intelligent way when acting together as a swarm, flock or school.","We developed a technology called artificial swarm intelligence, which is all about tapping the inherent knowledge, wisdom, intuition of groups.","Swarm intelligence is like a brain of brains.","We focus on a unique form of artificial intelligence called artificial swarm intelligence.","Taking a vote or poll is a great simple way to take a decision, but it doesn't help a group find consensus. It actually polarizes people and highlights the differences between them. People end up getting entrenched in their views.","Forcing polarized groups into a swarm allows them to find the answer that most people are satisfied with.","We take the sense of touch for granted. Think about it: Without it, you're missing one of the basic senses that enables you to interact with the world.","You have the sense of touch because you need it.","A poll will give you the most popular answer but not the answer that optimizes the preference of a group.","A swarm finds the solution people best agree upon. It optimizes collective support, whereas a poll tells us how we disagree.","UNU provides a continuous feedback loop of the group's preference for a choice, as well as its conviction. People are adjusting their levels of conviction based on the completeness of their own knowledge on the subject.","When a species wants to tap the collective intelligence of a population, they don't take a poll; they don't take a vote. They form a real-time system.","A poll finds the average opinion of a group. It takes the temperature of a crowd. A swarm focuses a group together, in real time, and has them work together as a system to answer a question instead.","Nature creates natural swarms. UNU uses networking technology and algorithms to take advantage of the knowledge, wisdom, and insights of a large group of people by allowing them to think as one.","In computers, we do all kinds of manual manipulations. We grab and drag icons. We click on and open windows. We pull down a screen. We stretch a screen. We scroll up and down.","If you sit at your desk and reach and grab a cup of coffee, you don't look directly at the cup, focus on it, and get your fingers lined up before grabbing the coffee. In real life, you reach for a cup that you see out of the corner of your eye, and when you feel it, you know you can grab it.","Feel provides an important channel of information.","We can't stop the development of smarter and smarter artificial intelligences. So our alternative is to make ourselves smarter so that we always stay one step ahead.","Swarms are one very simple way of keeping ourselves ahead of the machines.","The long-term value of amplifying the intelligence of people is a lot more important than betting on sports.","Immersion was founded in 1993 with the mission of bringing the sense of touch to computing. Our technology, TouchSense, is embedded in computer peripheral devices and allows users to reach in and physically interact with content on their computer screens."],"Louis Bacon":["My favorite memories growing up in North Carolina were hunting and fishing with my father and brothers. There, I developed a deep appreciation for protecting land and waterways. There, I learned outdoorsmanship.","Much like the conservationists who previously have received the Audubon Medal, including Stewart Udall, Rachel Carson and Ted Turner, I realize that this recognition cannot be a cause to rest, but a spur to continue our work.","When a profit-seeking company proposes to take citizens' private land away for its own gain, people should stand up for their rights.","I am a conservationist. It is in my DNA.","The ability to manage large assets well - it's like being Michael Jordan or winning the gold in the Olympics; it's what you aspire to.","I am proud to place Tercio Red River into a conservation easement forever protecting this spectacular landscape with Colorado Open Lands.","It is a wonderful honor to receive the Audubon Medal from the National Audubon Society, which for more than a century has fought tirelessly to protect and preserve our natural resources and environment for future generations.","As a nation, we owe a great deal to the National Audubon Society, one of our most distinguished and important environmental organizations, and all those who work to protect America's open land and waterways.","My mother brought me numerous times to visit Orton as a child, and I have visited the gardens with my children many times. Orton is a gem on the Cape Fear River and I am excited about our restoration efforts to bring it back to its original landscape.","We are too quickly losing important landscapes in this country to development - and I worry that if we do not act to protect them now, future generations will grow up in a profoundly different world."],"Louis Begley":["In legal practice, in the representation of clients, I have always felt deeply engaged, serene, and not all inclined to stand aside. I have always done whatever needed to be done, and have usually gotten my way.","I have no interest in writing confessions, in deliberately baring myself to my readers. I prefer to remain behind a screen.","If a comparative-literature major had existed at Harvard College for undergraduates I would have surely gone in that direction.","I think I am less self-assured when I write English than I would be if I were writing in my first language. I have to test each sentence over and over to be sure that it's right, that I haven't introduced some element that isn't English.","My views about the safety of Jews in the world have not been changed by the work on the Dreyfus affair or, for that matter, by the work I did on Franz Kafka for the book on him I published a year before the Dreyfus book appeared.","I think that Jews - because they are a distinct, gifted and successful group that differentiates itself from societies in which it lives - are vulnerable wherever the rule of law is not paramount.","I may well do some more polemical writing, if a subject that fires me up comes along. Apart from that possibility, I would like to continue to tell stories so long as I have stories to tell.","As you know, I am a novelist, and I really want to write novels. But I knew enough about the Dreyfus case to understand immediately why what happened to Dreyfus was not merely a cause celebre from the end of the 19th century, but an event that could be shown to teach us lessons of the greatest importance for our own time."],"Louis Bonaparte":["If I wanted to do wrong, I could not.","Nothing need be apprehended from this miserable adventurer.","I should see an enemy of my country in any one who would change by force that which has been established by law."],"Louis C. K.":["I've learned from experience that if you work harder at it, and apply more energy and time to it, and more consistency, you get a better result. It comes from the work.","Perception is created and twisted so quickly.","I'm bored' is a useless thing to say. You live in a great, big, vast world that you've seen none percent of.","I don't stop eating when I'm full. The meal isn't over when I'm full. It's over when I hate myself.","If you're a cartoon character or most TV characters, sure, you'll fight, because the punches are juicy-sounding and they don't leave marks. But in real life, if somebody punches you in the eye, it doesn't make any noise and your eye is swollen for, like, six months. It's a nightmare to get punched in the eye.","When I was first divorced, I started dating younger women, and it was really exciting. But after a while I was like, 'This is just dumb.'","Talking is always positive. That's why I talk too much.","I wish I could know everything ever, like that would be my wish - that's what I hope heaven is, that they tell you who shot JFK and all that stuff.","There's no such thing as a cheap laugh.","There's been a lot of simple vilification of right-wing people. It's really easy to say, 'Well, you're Christian, you're anti-this and that, and I hate you.' But to me, it's more interesting to say, 'What is this person like and how do they really think?'","There's two kinds of press that you get when you put out a TV show: The reviews, and the people that just decide what the reviews say.","There are people that really live by doing the right thing, but I don't know what that is, I'm really curious about that. I'm really curious about what people think they're doing when they're doing something evil, casually. I think it's really interesting, that we benefit from suffering so much, and we excuse ourselves from it.","There's no real preparing at home for stand-up. You just go and you just do it.","Gay men have to go through something to own their - who they are. They get beat up. They get ostracized. Whatever they go through, if they survive it, they come out very confident people.","I like pressure. Pressure doesn't make me crack. It's enabling. I eat pressure, and there might be times when I get a bad feeling in my gut that this might be too much, but you feel pressure when you're not doing something, you know?","People don't talk to me on airplanes.","I was a nerd growing up, and I'm a little antisocial and awkward.","A very painful part of being a parent is having really negative feelings about your children when you love them so much.","Being popular with an audience is a very rickety ladder to be on.","My ex-wife, she really didn't like the material that I did. And that's something I regret, that I wasn't more careful about making sure that she was O.K. with it. I just sort of didn't ask. So that's how that goes.","I'm enjoying the work while I get it right now.","There's a woman I see who's not my therapist, but she's like an old friend who's a therapist in profession. She lets me talk to her like a therapist once in a while, and she does a great thing. Whenever I have a big dilemma, like this is a big problem in my life, she always says, 'Wow, you're going to have to figure that out.'","Technically, I've learned that having good legs and wind is good for being on stage. You have to be in shape and have endurance.","Comedians work great as actors because they're good under pressure. With a lot of actors, you have to make them feel like everything's going really well to get a good performance out of them. But, if you have a comedian on the set, you can tell them, 'Hey, you really are screwing this up,' and then they just get better.","You can't direct without a good crew.","For my scale, how I grew up and live my life, I'm making plenty of money.","Most people are dead. Did you know that? It's true, out of all the people that ever were, almost all of them are dead.","It's easier to cancel a show if it's expensive.","The thing is, comedy's gone in a weird direction. People are really into ironic comedy and fakeness and cleverness.","Cars and cameras are the two things I let myself be materialistic about. I don't care about other stuff.","I thought about going to NYU film school - that was this ideal to me. But I didn't make any kind of grades in high school.","To me, art supplies are always okay to buy.","I think you have to try and fail, because failure gets you closer to what you're good at.","I've always loved boxing. It's something I've always been extremely excited about.","I have a crazy amount of different jobs, so the way I manage that is to not do more than one at a time. It's like old computers that had small memory chips, they would do something called swapping, where they would fill the memory with one task, do it and get it out.","I don't think women are better than men, I think men are a lot worse than women.","When you're a father in a marriage, you sort of become the mother's assistant. And you sort of get a list from her every day and you run down the list and it feels very much like a chore.","When I read things like the foundations of capitalism are shattering, I'm like, maybe we need that. Maybe we need some time where we're walking around with a donkey with pots clanging on the sides.","I've met a lot of people who've lost their jobs and they still have a sense of humor.","If you're a woman and a guy's ever said anything romantic to you, he just left off the second part that would have made you sick if you could have heard it.","Life isn't something you possess. It's something you take part in, and you witness.","I've had soccer moms come up and tell me they can relate when I say that I want to throw my baby in the trash.","When I am in a hotel, and I turn off the lights and the TV, I just freak out. I turn the TV back on and don't get any sleep.","I've tried to do away with lying in my life in the last few years, but it's hard.","Well, when I was younger, I lied all the time, because once you understand the power of lying, it's really like magic because you transform reality for people.","I was an awkward kid.","Oh, I love stand-up.","The only pitch I have to movie people is the same as this one: Just give me $8 million. I'm not telling you what it's about and I'm not telling you who's in it.","You can't cancel my stand-up tours. It's impossible. There's too many separate bosses. There is no 'bosses.'","I don't know what it's like to be an actor, where if your show gets canceled, really you're just a bum.","When two kids are being completely berserk, and they're naked and throwing food around, sometimes I just let it go because I can see a future where they're going to be dressed, and they're going to be at school. So I kind of let stuff go sometimes.","I'm not sure why I'm so often disgusting on stage. I don't always know where it comes from.","To me, it's very exhilarating when somebody else does a great thing, and it's not me.","Some entertainers don't pay attention to what's going on around them.","When you're young as a comic, you don't have a lot of leverage.","Whenever I've encountered a Christian saying, 'Why don't you stop talking like that so I can hear you?' I think, 'Well you're the one putting the earmuffs on, but I wish you could hear me because I like you.'","It's a positive thing to talk about terrible things and make people laugh about them.","The problem is, the more famous you get, the more people see you who didn't choose to.","I'm not a political comedian. That's just not what I do.","You know, the people who do indie film and decide who gets those little budgets? They're mean, man. They're cold and very cool-oriented.","I don't have a brother in real life.","I do feel a lot of times like I'm out of my league with my kids in terms of what my responsibility is.","My kids are really easy. I often worry that they're too easy to deal with. They're really nice people.","When I take my kids out for dinner or lunch, people smile at us.","If I do something for my kids, I get a medal, because most fathers don't.","I like all ladies of all different ages.","I grew up watching all these crazy movies, European movies and stuff, and I guess that I always laughed at things that were a little more offbeat.","A lot of the struggle I had with movies is I really loved moments and tones and feelings in a scene, and I loved creating those, but I never really had great stories to string them together.","I don't believe in this idea of, 'That's hate speech, stop it.'","I don't think it makes any sense to try to get anyone to not talk.","America's a family. We all yell at each other. It all works out.","You have to be aware of who you're talking to in an audience.","Anytime you see a bit where some stranger does something to me, it's me.","A household name is like ketchup. Everybody wants ketchup. Ketchup doesn't hurt anybody.","I love comedians. They're my community.","I like being full, every day, with stuff that I have to do.","I would rather be with my kids than anybody else.","To me the goal of comedy is to just laugh, which is a really high hearted thing, visceral connection and reaction.","I don't like comedy. I like funny things. I don't like comedy. Like, comedy movies are just, 'Oh Jesus.'","I don't have a room full of writers pitching ideas. It's just me out of my head.","People get successful and they start saying, 'Well of course I am! I was chosen! I'm special!' No, you're not.","Life is full of horrible mistakes.","Breaking records is not something you expect to be doing. That's like a sports thing, it's not usually a comedy and writing thing.","A lot of TV is put together by teams, by writing staffs and several different directors. It's a great, very smart way to make television. It's worked for however long TV's been around.","I spend enough time onscreen looking hangdog and depressed.","It's kind of awkward to eat alone in a restaurant because everybody's looking at me.","Every day starts, my eyes open and I reload the program of misery. I open my eyes, remember who I am, what I'm like, and I just go, 'Ugh'.","I never viewed money as being 'my money' I always saw it as 'the money.' It's a resource. If it pools up around me then it needs to be flushed back out into the system.","It's more fun to experience things when you don't know what's going to happen.","When I got divorced, I thought 'Well, there goes my act.'","I definitely look at my body and I go: 'Yuck.'","Comedy isn't polite and it isn't correct and it isn't accurate, even. It's just a mess. So that's the way that I approach it.","Everything that people say is testable.","Some things I think are very conservative, or very liberal. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I'm very suspicious. It doesn't make sense to me that you'd have the same solution to every issue.","Pushing the envelope' sort of implies that you're inside the envelope with everyone else, and you're trying to find the edges on the outsides.","If I owned a network, I would never let a guy just put people on without telling me who they are.","I'm not motivated to entertain people through Twitter, so just by having Twitter and not saying anything, I make people mad.","I think I'm past any window where I'm suddenly going to become surprisingly ripped so that people go, 'Oh, my God, what happened to you?'","Sometimes I try to take a nap before shows. That clears my head.","I could never sit down and write jokes.","I know what it's like to have a bunch of material that's working that you don't care about. You want to die.","I think one reason TV has always done well is because there is something comforting where you kind of know what you're going to be taken through.","I get mad like anybody else does, but being able to laugh about getting mad is very healthy, and my kids know that.","I do actually use a boxing trainer when I train for stand-up.","It's hard to know where your thoughts come from, especially when you have a thirst for material because you need it professionally."],"Louis D. Brandeis":["If we desire respect for the law, we must first make the law respectable.","If you would only recognize that life is hard, things would be so much easier for you.","Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.","Our government... teaches the whole people by its example. If the government becomes the lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.","What are the American ideals? They are the development of the individual for his own and the common good; the development of the individual through liberty; and the attainment of the common good through democracy and social justice.","Fear of serious injury alone cannot justify oppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and burnt women. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears.","Most of the things worth doing in the world had been declared impossible before they were done.","The most important political office is that of the private citizen.","To declare that in the administration of criminal law the end justifies the means to declare that the Government may commit crimes in order to secure conviction of a private criminal would bring terrible retribution.","We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.","What is Americanization? It manifests itself, in a superficial way, when the immigrant adopts the clothes, the manners and the customs generally prevailing here. Far more important is the manifestation presented when he substitutes for his mother tongue the English language as the common medium of speech.","There are no shortcuts in evolution.","Behind every argument is someone's ignorance.","Experience teaches us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the government's purposes are beneficent.","The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in the insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well meaning but without understanding.","America has believed that in differentiation, not in uniformity, lies the path of progress. It acted on this belief; it has advanced human happiness, and it has prospered.","If we would guide by the light of reason we must let our minds be bold.","The difference between a nation and a nationality is clear, but it is not always observed. Likeness between members is the essence of nationality, but the members of a nation may be very different. A nation may be composed of many nationalities, as some of the most successful nations are.","Neutrality is at times a graver sin than belligerence.","Democracy rests upon two pillars: one, the principle that all men are equally entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; and the other, the conviction that such equal opportunity will most advance civilization.","A man is a better citizen of the United States for being also a loyal citizen of his state and of his city; for being loyal to his family and to his profession or trade; for being loyal to his college or his lodge.","It is not wealth, it is not station, it is not social standing and ambition which can make us worthy of the Jewish name, of the Jewish heritage. To be worthy of them, we must live up to and with them. We must regard ourselves their custodians.","Organisation can never be a substitute for initiative and for judgement.","In the frank expression of conflicting opinions lies the greatest promise of wisdom in governmental action.","Let no American imagine that Zionism is inconsistent with patriotism. Multiple loyalties are objectionable only if they are inconsistent.","I abhor averages. I like the individual case. A man may have six meals one day and none the next, making an average of three meals per day, but that is not a good way to live.","We are not won by arguments that we can analyze, but by tone and temper; by the manner, which is the man himself.","Those who won our independence... valued liberty as an end and as a means. They believed liberty to be the secret of happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty.","The logic of words should yield to the logic of realities.","Men long for an afterlife in which there apparently is nothing to do but delight in heaven's wonders.","The world presents enough problems if you believe it to be a world of law and order; do not add to them by believing it to be a world of miracles.","However great his outward conformity, the immigrant is not Americanized unless his interests and affections have become deeply rooted here. And we properly demand of the immigrant even more than this. He must be brought into complete harmony with our ideals and aspirations and cooperate with us for their attainment.","When those of Jewish blood exhibit moral or intellectual superiority, genius or special talent, we feel pride in them, even if they have abjured the faith like Spinoza, Marx, Disraeli or Heine. Despite the meditations of pundits or the decrees of council, our own instincts and acts, and those of others, have defined for us the term 'Jew.'","During most of my life, my contact with Jews and Judaism was slight. I gave little thought to their problems, save in asking myself, from time to time, whether we were showing by our lives due appreciation of the opportunities which this hospitable country affords. My approach to Zionism was through Americanism."],"Louis Dudek":["The best live among us in disguise.","There are two kinds of people; those who are always well and those who are always sick. Most of the evils of the world come from the first sort and most of the achievement from the second.","The philistine provides the best definition of art. Anything that makes him rage is first class.","In a poem, the words happen; they just come. I let them. Otherwise, I wouldn't write. To interfere with what is happening is to distort the poem. Just a very small degree of intelligence and supervision is necessary. Very tactful. Any revision later that violates the text as it came, that begins rewriting the words, is fake.","What is forgiven is usually well remembered.","Art is anything people do with distinction.","The residue of religion in my work appears as a modified transcendentalism, and the positivist scientific side of my thought appears as concreteness and realism. The effort to reconcile the two is at the core of all my poetry.","The long poem cannot be a digressive, expansive, boring exposition. It is really made of very sharp, Imagistic, quintessential poetic elements."],"Louis E. Boone":["Don't fear failure so much that you refuse to try new things. The saddest summary of a life contains three descriptions: could have, might have, and should have.","I am definitely going to take a course on time management... just as soon as I can work it into my schedule."],"Louis Farrakhan":["The Jews don't like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that's a good name. Hitler was a very great man.","There really can be no peace without justice. There can be no justice without truth. And there can be no truth, unless someone rises up to tell you the truth.","Naturally, when one makes progressive steps, there may be some who see it as a betrayal of their goals and interests.","I hope that five years and ten years from now, I'll be a better man, a more mature man, a wiser man, a more humble man and a more spirited man to serve the good of my people and the good of humanity.","Overall, the challenge of leadership is both moral and one of developing the characteristics that make us respected by one another.","We are all gifted, but we have to discover the gift, uncover the gift, nurture and develop the gift and use it for the Glory of God and for the liberation struggle of our people.","I am not the same man I was 35 years ago. And I hope that five years and ten years from now, I'll be a better man, a more mature man, a wiser man, a more humble man and a more spirited man to serve the good of my people and the good of humanity.","White people are potential humans - they haven't evolved yet.","Qaddafi is hated because he is the leader of a small country that is rich, but he uses his money to finance liberation struggles.","Black leadership has to recognize that principles more than speech, character more than a claim, is greater in advancing the cause of our liberation than what has transpired thus far.","And I hope that five years and 10 years from now, I'll be a better man, a more mature man, a wiser man, a more humble man and a more spirited man to serve the good of my people and the good of humanity.","America will always side with those whom she can direct, give orders to and have those orders obeyed.","As a result of that, America desires a moderate Islam; an Islam that America can control; an Islam that America can give direction to and give orders to its leaders.","Without an advocate for the poor, without a new state of mind in America, the country lies on the brink of anarchy.","I think that rather than condemning Islam, Islam needs to be studied by those who are sincere.","You must recognize that the way to get the good out of your brother and your sister is not to return evil for evil.","There is no one right now in my judgment that can unite the Black electorate in such a way to present our agenda to a nominee to have them forthrightly address our concerns.","I am hoping that in this year of the family we will go into our families and reconcile differences.","They call them terrorists, I call them freedom fighters.","They should regard me as what I am. I am a spiritual leader and teacher.","But when I reintroduced the Nation of Islam, and began to host meetings in cities and thousands and thousands of people come out.","I don't think about my legacy, if indeed, I have one.","But if I thought on it, I would like to be remembered as a brother who loved his people and did everything that I knew to fight for them, the liberation of our people.","Could it be that my circle is largely black and that it is why I am influential in black circles but not in white circles?","If we don't make earnest moves toward real solutions, then each day we move one day closer to revolution and anarchy in this country. This is the sad, and yet potentially joyous, state of America.","Anarchy may await America, due to the daily injustices suffered by the people.","I loved Elijah Muhammad with a love that I can't adequately describe.","Because as a youngster I longed to see the Black man free and I longed to see anyone stand up for us.","Not that I regret saying what I believed to be the truth, but I regret anything that I might have written or spoken that could have been used in a way to help to foster that atmosphere out of which came the loss of life of Brother Malcolm.","The die is set and Malcolm will not escape for the foolish talk he spoke against his benefactor, such a man, is worthy of death, and it would have been so, were it not for Muhammad's confidence that God would give him the victory over the enemies.","However, those who have used those words use half the sentence to fit their purpose, which, of course, I believe is to discredit me and the new Nation of Islam that has come up around me.","I was never named in the early years as having anything to do with the assassination of Malcolm.","Because wherever I am today, I still owe it to God and I owe it to two men - the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X and of course, two very special women, my mother and my wife.","A brother who recognizes that we have shortcomings, we, in the struggle, have faults, and that he wanted to reconcile differences.","What President Bush did in his doctrine of preemptive strike and in his war in Afghanistan and in Iraq was to turn even his allies in Europe negatively toward America.","So, this war is against the Islam that the West does not control.","The Bush administration does not desire to see Islam practiced in its pristine purity.","Everything that I'm attempting to do is based on my understanding of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and what he wanted for his people.","Many of the Jews who owned the homes, the apartments in the black community, we considered them bloodsuckers because they took from our community and built their community but didn't offer anything back to our community.","I think that ego-driven leaders will be a thing of the past because the masses are tired.","It appears that there is a genocidal plan against Black people.","I believe that for the small numbers of Jewish people in the United States, they exercise a tremendous amount of influence on the affairs of government.","I don't own Hollywood."],"Louis Finkelstein":["A rabbi should not despair if people do not do as much as they should.

God is merciful.","In taking action we must remember that the things which are happening to the Jews today are but a part of the general disintegration anticipated by philosophers and historians of different schools for almost half a century.","We realize that Judaism as a faith can survive only in an atmosphere of general faith.","The road to success, and by that I mean... the possibility of giving the best one has to the cause that one loves most, is not easy.","It therefore become essential for the future of Judaism itself that its advancement should be correlated with a similar effort to advance the cause of religion generally.","It is a grave matter to enter a war, without adequate military preparation; it may prove fatal to come into peace, without moral and religious preparation.","I hope to devote all of my spare time, which ordinarily would go to research, my summers, and every ounce of strength I can muster to further the project.","I feel very strongly that it is vital for us to constantly keep in mind the fact that the Jewish problem is but a phase of the world problem.","From the long range point of view, I do not know of anything we can do more important than to make some contribution to the preservation of religion as a vital force in America.","For as Jews, the problem happens to be more urgent and vital than for others; because the destruction of religion on America will involve the destruction also of the religious training of freedom; and with that our civil liberties."],"Louis Fischer":["What is the secret of Stalin's unquestioned strength? He controls every wheel and screw of the party machine, which is the source of authority and power in the Soviet Union.","For dynamic energy, driving force, and discipline, the Russian Communist Party is unique the world over, perhaps even throughout history.","Psychology and economics are Stalin's favorable winds. He is also the party 'boss.' But he is, in addition, the Soviet Union's most striking personality."],"Louis Freeh":["Collecting intelligence information is like trying to drink water out of a fire hydrant. You know, in hindsight It's great. The problem is there's a million dots at the time.","The problem was with Bill Clinton, the scandals and rumored scandals, the incubating ones and the dying ones never ended. Whatever moral compass the president was consulting was leading him in the wrong direction. His closets were full of skeletons just waiting to burst out.","The American people must be willing to give up a degree of personal privacy in exchange for safety and security.","We are potentially the most dangerous agency in the country.","The country was not focused on terrorism before September 11th.","My role and my obligation was to conduct criminal investigations.","I was concerned about who he would put in there as FBI director because he had expressed antipathy for the FBI, for the director. I was going to stay there and make sure that he couldn't replace me.","I was a prosecutor and an FBI agent for many, many years.","I wanted all my visits to be official. When I sent the pass back with a note, I had no idea it would antagonize the president. I found out years later that it did.","I deal in facts.","And I understand that, I testified in closed hearings over eight years because there are intelligence matters, there are sensitive matters that should not be held in a public hearing.","It's a truism that you can investigate anything forever.","I have always said to myself, 'I never want to say I'm leaving a job because I want to spend more time with my family.' I feel sorry for people when they say that. But my advice to them is that you shouldn't have taken the job in the first place."],"Louis Garrel":["Every actor has an obsession with their hair. You can see it on set, and you start to realize it's completely silly. I can be very obsessed by my hair, but all these hours spent trying to style it are useless, because ultimately, you can't change your haircut. It's all the same.","I'm not a singer, so I reproduce a little bit what I see on television and what I listen to on the radio. I don't have self-control, really, so I didn't want to sing like Mariah Carey.","I'm interested in existential films: I love movies that console you in the same way that a person consoles a weeping child.","It's true I have a hard time with the notion of creating a character. And I feel it's a limit. I'm always really impressed by actors who are able to construct a character, like Johnny Depp.","When I was 13 years old, I was dressing in a rap style. And then I changed schools, and the rap style became old-fashioned, so I changed it completely.","Some people choose their style at the age of 14, but I changed mine all the time.","I think the moment I discovered I definitely wanted to act was when I saw a play alone by myself when I was fourteen. Maybe it was a Moliere play? I discovered the atmosphere of the theater, and I knew I wanted to be an actor.","To make a movie is very stressful, especially when you work with your father. You want to think the movie is good. Even when I don't work with my father, I want it to be good.","I'm not usually comfortable to talk about things I haven't done yet.","I hope each day to have done 10 seconds of good work that they can use in the film. And I'm always afraid I didn't get those 10 seconds.","I like to be able to understand the feeling of the director, that a film corresponds to something in his life. Otherwise, it doesn't interest me much.","I wanted to be a lawyer. I love that job; I don't know why.","In France, I would like to worth with Patrice Chereau, who made 'Queen Margot.'","The separation of a childless couple is dramatic, but the separation of a couple with children is always tragic.","My grandfather criticized me thousands of times, and he gave me a compliment once.","I like being surrounded by students and intellectuals."],"Louis Gossett, Jr.":["My father's best friend, Georgie Terra, was an Italian guy. The children and the cousins and nieces and nephews were children of the Mafia. Those were the children he grew up with. If you want to go to a safe neighborhood, go to where the Mafia is.","The worst resentment that anybody can have is one you feel justified to keep.","We need to do whatever it takes to get our children together and pay attention to them, because that's our future. What's in the hearts and minds of our children is what's in our future.","The Lord may not come when you want Him, but he's always going to be there on time.","I can do more than anyone suspects. I pride myself on my versatility. It took 32 years of difficult parts, second leads, villains and juveniles. The Oscar changed the quality of the roles I was being offered.","When I'm offered a role, I look at what I think I can do with it. I look to see if I can project myself into it.","If a role isn't different, it's not worth doing.","I didn't know anything about acting, I didn't know anything about theater, but I was just an exceptional student at high school. I wanted to play ball; I'm going after a basketball scholarship and be a doctor. I got injured and my marks began to drop.","I was president of the schools in junior high and high school, got a scholarship to New York University, played a little basketball, and was a celebrity.","I was at Woodstock. In the mud.","I was always told that I'd have to do a movie with a white guy in order to get the money. That's the way it was. That made me feel that I should have chosen some other profession, so I could have gotten my just deserts.","You have a bout with death, things that touch your mortality, when that happens, all that bling-bling gets thrown away because all you've got is you and God.","I'm cancer-free. And I'm on antioxidants and acupuncture and a different diet. And I have a different outlook on life. I don't have resentment any more. It's wonderful.","My father was adopted. He grew up in the Italian household.","'Avatar' was gorgeous. There are good stories in there, but when used in other movies they're similar to those violent video games. Characters using deadly weapons. The children follow these movies.","I was invited to play with the New York Knicks. I was never drafted, but I was invited to the rookie camp.","I think more important than law is the hearts of people.","Working on the ABC movie 'Don't Look Back: The Story of Leroy 'Satchel' Paige,'' which we filmed in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, was a special pleasure, particularly because I'd played baseball in high school.","One of the most fascinating projects I worked on right after 'Officer' was 'Sadat,' a role for which Anwar Sadat's widow, Jehan, personally chose me. Although this TV miniseries won me nominations for the Golden Globe and an Emmy, strangely, it was boycotted in the Middle East.","Sometimes I believe that the reason I have been able to do such exemplary work on the screen is because this is the only place I can be free, neither censured nor judged.","Some Marine units actually use 'An Officer and a Gentleman' in their training programs.","When we look at each other, we're the same family. You don't have to see black or Latino - we're one family. That's America.","One family, one nation, indivisible. That mentality is essential for our salvation.","The only time I was really free was when the director said 'Action' in front of a camera or on the stage, and that's when I flew.","The two lines from 'Roots' that stick out to me are, 'You no more in Africa. You in America now,' and what I said after Kunta escaped: 'What is it like to be free, Kunta? It must be something.'","George Clooney and Brad Pitt, with those 'Oceans' films they do, they get to work together, make a whole lot of money, and make a major film statement. Imagine if once a year, myself, Denzel Washington, Laurence Fishburne, James Earl Jones, we did some relevant film together to make a statement.","One of my best friends while shooting 'Roots' was Vic Morrow, the guy that whips Kunta.","There's really nothing like a live audience right there. When you're in a bad show, you can hear the creaks in the chairs.","We started the family Bible after slavery was abolished. My great-grandmother remembered the Bible being started, which meant that she was a slave as a young girl. When she died, the Bible was at least 105 years old, so she must have been nearly 115 years old. Her daughter, my grandmother, died at 97, and her husband at 98.","It's presumptuous for us to think we are the only beings in the cosmos.","You never know when what you do in the arts means something to people, and you never really know if you've been received well.","There are beautiful words in the Bible and in our pledges and the Declaration of Independence.","I believe the gift of acting is a gift from God, my oath to God, and I want to make sure on a daily basis that it is honed and deeply spiritual... I want to believe that the audience believes that my acting comes from this special place.","I think God asks us to promise to replenish the planet and to pay 100% attention to our young so that they will develop character and a good conscience.","Never made a million dollars from any of my 78 movies. People thought I had this fortune, which I never had.","I am so grateful that the public has given me this gift. They look at me as a person - not as a race or a color. The word for it is freedom - to be accepted as me.","After the Academy Award, well, I was left with a lot of time on my hands. I thought I'd get a lot of offers - and they didn't come.","I had an Oscar, an Emmy, and yet I had this big hole in my soul.","We are born with freedom and hope, but often that's dashed because of our color. But in school, I'd already been taught that no one could tell me that you can't do something because you're black.","When '12 Years a Slave' got that much attention, everyone started to copy that. That story has to be told, but there are a lot more stories to be told than slavery.","I grew up with all my cousins. The men worked, and the older women raised us - my mother, my aunt, my grandmother. My great-grandmother was the matriarch, and sometimes there were 30 of us.","I was down in Wilmington, Delaware, doing 'The Desk Set' with Shirley Booth. I was at the DuPont Hotel. I walked out, and there was this grill next door called the New England Grill. I loved seafood. They said very nicely, 'We don't serve colored people.'"],"Louis Jordan":["The only people who make love all the time are liars.","With my little band, I did everything they did with a big band. I made the blues jump."],"Louis Jourdan":["There are actors in this town who made important careers for a long, long period just by taking the parts that Cary Grant turned down.","I never see my movies. When they're on television, I click them away. Hollywood created an image, and I long ago reconciled myself with it. I was the French cliche.","I would rather be called a character actor than a star.","When one has been married over thirty years, of course it would be absurd not to admit there have been some difficulties, at some times. But the important thing is that we have weathered them."],"Louis Kahn":["Architecture is the thoughtful making of space.","A great building must begin with the unmeasurable, must go through measurable means when it is being designed and in the end must be unmeasurable.","Architecture is the reaching out for the truth.","Design is not making beauty, beauty emerges from selection, affinities, integration, love.","If people want to see Beaux-Arts, it's fine with me. I'm interested in good architecture as anybody else.","You say to a brick, 'What do you want, brick?' And brick says to you, 'I like an arch.' And you say to brick, 'Look, I want one, too, but arches are expensive and I can use a concrete lintel.' And then you say: 'What do you think of that, brick?' Brick says: 'I like an arch.'","Every building must have... its own soul.","Every time a student walks past a really urgent, expressive piece of architecture that belongs to his college, it can help reassure him that he does have that mind, does have that soul.","Architecture struck me between the eye and the eyeball.","The first thing that an architect must do is to sense that every building you build is a world of its own, and that this world of its own serves an institution.","A room is not a room without natural light.","I try to create homes, not houses.","In a small room one does not say what one would in a large room.","Consider the momentous event in architecture when the wall parted and the column became.","The street is a room by agreement.","What does a house want to be?","How precious a book is in light of the offering, in the light of the one who has the privilege of this offering. The library tells you of this offering."],"Louis Kronenberger":["Individualism is rather like innocence; there must be something unconscious about it.","Old age is an excellent time for outrage. My goal is to say or do at least one outrageous thing every week.","The trouble with us in America isn't that the poetry of life has turned to prose, but that it has turned to advertising copy.","There seems to be a terrible misunderstanding on the part of a great many people to the effect that when you cease to believe you may cease to behave.","One of the misfortunes of our time is that in getting rid of false shame we have killed off so much real shame as well.","The trouble with our age is all signposts and no destination.","The closer and more confidential our relationship with someone, the less we are entitled to ask about what we are not voluntarily told.","Nothing so soothes our vanity as a display of greater vanity in others; it make us vain, in fact, of our modesty.","Highly educated bores are by far the worst; they know so much, in such fiendish detail, to be boring about.","The Englishman wants to be recognized as a gentleman, or as some other suitable species of human being, the American wants to be considered a good guy.","Privacy was in sufficient danger before TV appeared, and TV has given it its death blow.","Many people today don't want honest answers insofar as honest means unpleasant or disturbing, They want a soft answer that turneth away anxiety.","It is the gossip columnist's business to write about what is none of his business.","In art there are tears that lie too deep for thought."],"Louis L'Amour":["To make democracy work, we must be a nation of participants, not simply observers. One who does not vote has no right to complain.","All loose things seem to drift down to the sea, and so did I.","A great book begins with an idea; a great life, with a determination.","The idea of education has been so tied to schools, universities, and professors that many assume there is no other way, but education is available to anyone within reach of a library, a post office, or even a newsstand.","Victory is won not in miles but in inches. Win a little now, hold your ground, and later, win a little more.","There will come a time when you believe everything is finished. Yet that will be the beginning.","No memory is ever alone; it's at the end of a trail of memories, a dozen trails that each have their own associations.","Often I hear people say they do not have time to read. That's absolute nonsense. In the one year during which I kept that kind of record, I read twenty-five books while waiting for people. In offices, applying for jobs, waiting to see a dentist, waiting in a restaurant for friends, many such places.","A wise man fights to win, but he is twice a fool who has no plan for possible defeat.","Anger is a killing thing: it kills the man who angers, for each rage leaves him less than he had been before - it takes something from him.","For one who reads, there is no limit to the number of lives that may be lived, for fiction, biography, and history offer an inexhaustible number of lives in many parts of the world, in all periods of time.","If you write a book about a bygone period that lies east of the Mississippi River, then it's a historical novel. If it's west of the Mississippi, it's a western, a different category. There's no sense to it.","I think of myself... as a troubadour, a village storyteller, the guy in the shadows of the campfire.","Nobody got anywhere in the world by simply being content.","A good beginning makes a good end.","Knowledge is like money: to be of value it must circulate, and in circulating it can increase in quantity and, hopefully, in value.","I think it's time that we have a women's show about the West. The concentration has been on the men and the Indians.","I'm actually writing history. It isn't what you'd call big history. I don't write about presidents and generals... I write about the man who was ranching, the man who was mining, the man who was opening up the country.","To disbelieve is easy; to scoff is simple; to have faith is harder.","Too often I would hear men boast of the miles covered that day, rarely of what they had seen.","No one can get an education, for of necessity education is a continuing process.","I start with a character and a situation, but I don't know what's going to happen until I write it. Sometimes things happen that surprise me.","He might never really do what he said, but at least he had it in mind. He had somewhere to go.","I don't travel and tell stories, because that's not the way these days. But I write my books to be read aloud, and I think of myself in that oral tradition.","I had begun reading earlier than most because my sister Emmy Lou, no doubt to keep me from bothering her, decided it was easier to teach me to read stories to myself rather than to read them to me, as she had been doing."],"Louis Leakey":["I kept an open mind on the question of whether a hominid had been present in Europe in the early Pleistocene.","I put a bullet into the back of the crocodile's neck just behind the head, thus killing it. If a crocodile is hit in any other part of its anatomy it disappears into the water and is irrecoverable.","To save an animal's life in order that it may suffer indefinitely is something I would never condone.","The majority of people in Angola were not provided with any kind of schooling and were completely illiterate, very badly paid, and treated almost as slaves.","The trip I made to Angola to study the prehistoric contents of the gravel beds as a means of deciding the age of the deposits and their economic potential was the first time prehistory had ever been used for such a purpose.","I felt that in time simple stone tools would be found in early Pleistocene in England.","I have examined the stomach contents of seven aardvarks.","I saw what looked like another fallen tree in front of me and put my foot on it to cross over. At that moment it reared up in front of me-the biggest python I had ever seen!","Far too often animals are put to sleep when they could be saved through proper care and nursing.","Sometime during the many millions of years that have elapsed since mammalian faunas came into existence, some sort of island crossed from West Africa to South America.","Raising funds for my fourth expedition proved to be very difficult.","The author knows just what he wants to illustrate and how he would like it to be done.","At Olduvai, for 20 years, Mary and I had investigated and made a general survey of the overall geology.","The Foxhall jaw has now been missing for many years.","South Africa had a long record of studies in prehistory, going back to the end of the last century.","There is tragic evidence to show that the paintings at the French prehistoric art sites are deteriorating.","We set up the promised clinic for the sick and wounded Masai.","Although we followed that hyena for the best part of half an hour, we never caught up with it.","Sometimes string figures were used to illustrate stories, as in the case of an Eskimo example that depicts a man catching a salmon. Sometimes they had magic or religious significance.","When my father arrived in Kenya, he had found the Kikuyu way of life similar to that of the British at the time the Romans invaded England 2,000 years ago.","Most Kikuyu marriages were arranged on the basis of what is described by anthropologists as the bride price.","The Dalmatian breed of dog has many primitive characteristics.","Colonial governors and senior civil servants are not easy people to argue with, and I was not popular because of my criticism of the colonial service in Kenya."],"Louis Leterrier":["When you do a first movie, you're contractually supposed to do the second one and then you don't do it, you become an executive producer. That's why there are a ton of directors who have executive producer credits on other movies.","I've started movies without screenplays both on 'Clash' and on 'Hulk,' and that is tremendously stressful because you have a tendency to overcompensate with effects. You haven't tested it in your head. You didn't run it over and over again and covered all of the plot holes and figure it out. It's a marathon that you sprint.","'Iron Man' was this fun, poppy thing bound to make a zillion dollars. And we were the other side of a superhero movie. More complex with The Hulk being this complex character - that's what it was.","Even though I studied in New York and I know the American system, I come from France where I learned that with movies in France where the director is king. There's no such thing as a studio edit. It's the director's cut, period.","I feel like the great filmmakers who have a true voice, yeah they take the notes, they understand the notes, but it's really about the notes underneath the notes. When you do a test screening and somebody says, 'Well, I didn't like the love story,' but it was probably just too long.","I think our movie, 'Now You See Me,' is an emotional movie rooted in smart and wits and fully amazing actors working perfectly together. It's like a supergroup of musicians.","I'll tell you what, I had complete control on 'Unleashed.' I directed, produced, chose the musician, picked the costumes, and everything. I never had anyone saying, 'I don't like this and I don't like that.' The studio, Universal, were easy. It was this weird movie no one cared about.","It's true, I'm the youngest, highest-grossing French director. I have a few records, but no one knows or simply doesn't care. That's good, because I like that. Ultimately, I want to keep working, making a lot of movies, and get better at it. It's about finding great scripts and bringing them to life.","My favorite moment is when someone says, 'I like 'Unleashed.' 'Now You See Me' is so much fun.' That's what I want to do: smart, fun and big movies. I cannot lie, I love working with those big paint brushes. I have a blast doing these movies.","Movies are not finished. They are abandoned. A movie is never finished.","I'm a 'Clash of the Titans'/'Star Wars' baby. I'm not a new 'Star Wars' baby. I'm not an 'Avatar' baby. That full CG doesn't work for me. I need interactivity. I need to feel the goo. I need to feel people coming out of animatronics and just interacting with props.","My fear in converting it to 3-D is that people will say, 'Oh, it's the 3-D 'Clash of the Titans.' No, it's 'Clash of the Titans,' the movie, and then, on top of that, you have the 3-D conversion. The 2-D movie works as well as the 3-D movie. I want to make sure that people like the 2-D version.","What's great about 'The Avengers' is that it's the next step. It's not just superhero fights super-villain and superhero wins. It's about superheroes that come together and interact. It's a clash of the egos. You could do 'Avengers 1' without a villain, just with all these guys coming together. They could sit down and just have a discussion.","I'll say it, I love working with actors, I'm a fan of actors. They bring so much, and they can also break a movie, but when it works I give it all to the actors. I'll say it, I think that 'The Transporter' is great not because of my direction, it really is great because Jason Statham was great in it.","I'm one of the lucky directors that pretty much every movie I've done has started a franchise. But I never think this way. I think that's the way you break it, if you go, 'then at the end, at the end we'll see you later.' I was forced to do it in 'Clash of the Titans.'","I'm stuck somewhere a small island in the middle of the Atlantic where I'm alone. Because in France, they're like, 'No, you're not like us, you're not a French guy.' And in America, they're like, 'You're not like us.' I'm really alone in my little thing.","French cinema has always been very interesting, and it's still very powerful. I think it goes to show that it's great to still have a cinema that doesn't try to emulate, for example, American cinema.","It's funny, I started by making fake American movies, 'The Transporter' and stuff like that. I was shooting in France, but everything was in English. But then afterwards, I was looking at real French movies like the Jacques Audiard movies.","Great actors are so easy to direct. It's like they're big 747s that you just have to move left and right, and I don't really need to direct. I need to put them in the right costume, with the right haircut, in the right location, and with the right actor to act with. And then my job is almost done, with a great script, obviously.","I like the idea of a TV show. You take time to get to know your characters. You can introduce a lot of characters. You don't need your three-action set pieces that you usually need for movies.","Frankly, with HBO and Showtime and cable shows, the DVD box sets and all, you can have a product that doesn't make you feel like as soon as it's projected, it's thrown away. It's really a piece of art.","I did my 'Hulk,' but it was not easy. If I do another Hulk film it will always be compared to the Ang Lee thing, and my first one... if I come back, I'd love to do another superhero, something different that I can really put my touch on.","I talked to Marvel about 'Thor' at one point, but I didn't want to do Thor. It wasn't something I read growing up, really; it wasn't one of the books I loved.","'Captain America' I love, and that would be great, but c'mon, a Frenchman doing 'Captain America?' They would burn my passport.","If I was to direct a movie about a super-confident guy, first of all I would hate that character. I can do a super-confident guy who crashes and burns and has to rebuild himself as somebody humble. But a super-confident guy that just gets more confident and gets the girl and the money and more success? That's not interesting.","I love comedies, and I like sometimes comedies have a tendency to get a bit lazy. 'The Other Guys' was not lazy.","The new 'Avatar' BluRay is a lesson in filmmaking. It really is inspiring.","When I was in film school, I was learning more theory than practice."],"Louis MacNeice":["My stepmother appeared when I was about 9. My brother was sent off to an institute in Scotland & my sister & I were sent to school. As my stepmother's ideas were then wholly Quaker, mixed with a naive & charming innocence & a little snobbery, it was one dotty epoch on top of another. I always remained terrified of my father.","In writing 'A Portrait of Athens' I have attempted - rather impressionistically - to give a panorama of its present. But I have also brought in its past because I sincerely think that there is a continuity.","You can't express emotion without giving information.","In January 1921, I found myself wonderfully alone in an empty carriage in a rocking train in the night between Waterloo and Sherborne. Stars on each side of me; I ran from side to side of the carriage, checking the constellations.","Nationalism of the Irish type is often regarded as reactionary. With the World Revolution and the Classless Society waiting for the midwife, why take a torch to the stable to assist at the birth of a puppy? Even if the puppy is pedigree. On this question I am unable to make up my mind.","Nearly all children have a feeling for rhythm in words, for the delicate pattern of nursery rhymes. Many adults have lost this feeling and, if they read verse at all, demand a far cruder music than that which they once appreciated.","I am not yet born; O fill me with strength against those who would freeze my humanity.","Let them not make me a stone and let them not spill me, otherwise kill me.","I am at home in Dublin, more than in any other city.","A harrassed and dubious childhood under the hand of a well-meaning but barbarous mother's help from County Armagh led me to think of the North of Ireland as prison and the South as a land of escape.","I am 33 years old, and what can I have been doing that I still am in a muddle? But everyone else is, too; maybe our muddles are concurrent.","When I went to bed as a child, I was told, 'You don't know where you'll wake up.' When I ran in the garden, I was told that running was bad for the heart. Everything had its sinister aspect - milk shrinks the stomach, lemon thins the blood.","Dublin was hardly worried by the war; her old preoccupations were still preoccupations. The intelligentsia continued their parties; their mutual malice was as effervescent as ever.","Mysticism, in the narrow sense, implies a specific experience which is foreign to most poets and most men, but on the other hand, it represents an instinct which is a human sine qua non.","The individualist is an atom thinking about himself (Thank God I am not as other men); the communist, too often, is an atom having ecstasies of self-denial (Thank God I am one in a crowd).","I would have a poet able bodied, fond of talking, a reader of the newspapers, capable of pity and laughter, informed in economics, appreciative of women, involved in personal relationships, actively interested in politics, susceptible to physical impressions.","A poet should always be 'collaborating' with his public, but this public, in the mass, cannot make itself heard, and he has to guess at its requirements and its criticisms.","My sympathies are Left. On paper and in the soul. But not in my heart or my guts.","The poet is primarily a spokesman, making statements or incantations on behalf of himself or others - usually for both, for it is difficult to speak for oneself without speaking for others or to speak for others without speaking for oneself.","My birth was managed so rottenly that my mother had eventually to have a hysterectomy, after which she was ill off & on till she dies for obscure reasons when I was just 7.","All the people I know have been conditioned by snobbery.","For this reason poets and artists developed the doctrine of Art for Art's Sake. The community did not appear to need them, so, tit for tat, they did not need the community. This being granted, it was no longer necessary or even desirable to make one's poetry either intelligible or sympathetic to the community.","Good poets have written in order to describe something or to preach something - with their eye on the object or the end. The essence of the poetry does not lie in the thing described or in the message imparted but in the resulting concrete unity, the poem.","Style without content is bad style.","I would admit that poetry is something more than mere communication and that if that 'something more' could be abstracted from the whole, it might well prove to be that which makes the whole a poem.","Wyndham Lewis is basically a pessimist, thinking of human beings as doomed animals or determinist machines. His theory of satire is based on this view, and he finds plenty of evidence to support it in contemporary practice.","The poet is a specialist in something which everyone practises. Herein, poetry differs from the other arts. Everyone does not practise music or painting or even dancing, but everyone without exception puts together words poetically every day of his life.","All experiment is made on a basis of tradition; all tradition is the crystallization of experiment.","Everyone is not able, or inclined, to write poetry in the narrower sense any more than everyone is qualified to take part in a walking race. But just as all of us can and do walk, so all of us can and do use language poetically.","The poet has no greater number of muscles than the ordinary conversationalist; he merely has more highly developed muscles and better coordination. And he practises his activity according to a stricter set of rules.","The rules or 'laws' of poetry are only tentative devices, an approximate scheme. There is no Sinaitic recipe for poetry, for the individual poem is the norm.","Broadcasting is plastic; while it can ape the press, it can also emulate the arts.","All the arts, to varying degrees, involve some kind of a compromise. This being so, how far need the radio dramatist go to meet the public without losing sight of himself and his own standards of value?","We are all fed from hundreds and thousands of hands. Often we do not know whose they are nor how they work. Only a few of us ever visualize the hands that grope in the coal mines or push levers in the mills or handle axes in the lumber camp.","Democracy - or any improvement on it - will rest on the layman's right to criticize. His criticism will be often - very often - damn silly, but if, like Plato and the Fascists, we take away his right to criticize, we take away his right to appreciate.","The teapot takes in water and gives out tea. So the human individual takes in anything you give him and promptly transforms it; he is ready to give you out again his own reactions - first, in thought and emotion, then in voice or action.","As things may turn out in the future, people may (though I doubt it) find that their work gives them all the enjoyment - physical, intellectual or aesthetic - which they may require. That certainly is not so now.","It is a retrogression when human beings begin to insist on uniform, on one-mindedness, on conditioning their offspring so that all their reactions are automatic.","I am more proud of what distinguishes man from the animals than of what he has in common with them.","I do not envy any animal, though I envy many of their capacities.","Man is an unhappy animal and one that can talk. If he was not unhappy, he would have nothing to talk about. But if he had nothing to talk about, he would be unhappy.","Before I joined the BBC I was, like most of the intelligentsia, prejudiced not only against that institution but against broadcasting in general.","Though I do regard the Inquisition in general and the burning of Giordano Bruno in particular as blots on the history of the Roman Catholic Church, I am far from being actuated by hatred of that church, and in fact cannot imagine that European civilization would have developed or survived without it.","I have just finished my novel (rough draft). It is to be called 'Anacoluthon.' This will make the public think it is an historical romance.","Some day I shall write a novel and call it 'A Walking Tour in the Congo' or 'Thrills and Spills in Aeronautics'; but I keep this type of title as a last & mercenary resort."],"Louis Malle":["I didn't feel like going any further in this scene with the boy. He was not a professional actor, and if I had pushed the scene any further it would have destroyed the tone of the movie.","Well, Fellini... there is always Fellini.","When you are working on a script, the story itself is not difficult. You say this would happen and then this, resulting perhaps in this. And the dialogue you make as true as you can.","You must find the note, the correct key, for your story. If you find it, everything will work. If you do not, everything will stick out like elbows."],"Louis Navellier":["We call it the zigzag theory. You want to find something that zigs and something that zags and blend them together to get a better combined performance.","All I'm trying to do is manage money and take care of my shareholders.","Internally, when we manage portfolios, we figure out what works in large cap, what works in mid cap, what works in small cap. Generally speaking, large cap stocks want earning stability, strong cash flow, margin expansion.","There are several things that can create an alpha - stock buybacks are one. High dividend yields are another, especially nowadays because the stock market yields more than the banks and the tenure treasury. But by and large, it tends to be companies with a strong cash flow, rising sales, accelerated earnings, a profit margin expansion.","After the Versailles treaty, the U.S. could have chosen to become a global economic loan shark, but we didn't, and let a lot of the tab slide. So not all lending and borrowing is bad.","Optimization tells us precisely how to diversify the portfolio, whether I should have 12% in semiconductors or 4% in biotech, etc., and it literally tells me how to diversify not only the industry groups but the stocks.","I still love the semiconductor industry.","One of the things that launched the strength in biotech is when the pharmaceutical industry itself got a little slow.","I had Dell for four and a half years, and its sales are still phenomenal, but their operating margins started to contract, so I sold it in early 1999. There's nothing wrong with Dell! It's a fine company. It's just the business risk they took.","If you go back to 2001, the market had two violent short covering rallies then, although I know the market didn't officially get going until March 2003.","I sell these intermediate bond portfolios for people that can't go to stocks.","Now quantitatively we rank things on something called alpha over standard deviation, which is the return independent of the market divided by volatility. Usually, to get a high ranking, you need some buying pressure.","I expect my return to be 18 to 25 percent in 1988, while the Standard & Poor's 500 should rise 8 to 12 percent and OTC stocks gain 15 percent as liquidity emerges.","I simply can't buy as much of some stocks such as Detection Systems or United Education & Software as I'd like because there just aren't all that many shares available.","My advice to the average investor in 1988 is to be patient and think long-term. It will take 18 months for confidence to get better and, in the meantime, this is absolutely no place for short-term money.","There's a lot of companies that profit from a weak dollar.","If you are a short-term trader, you have the right to come and go from our funds.","When volume drops off, prices settle down. Volume is the force that turns stocks higher.","I grade my stocks. I'm what they call a quant, one of the geeks of the stock market.","I want attractive stocks that will benefit from persistent institutional buying pressure.","In college, I was told the market can't be beat.","What we do is we test what works on Wall Street. And sometimes it is earnings momentum, and sometimes it's earnings surprises. Sometimes it's price-to-sales cash flow, and then we put together our stock selection models.","We test everything on a one- and a three-year cycle. And you want to stress-test a model, and the three-year test usually does that because you have a growth and value bias. You have different interest rate environments.","There's 4,000-plus stocks out there, and sometimes it gets a little confusing. And we like them to start with the portfolio grader, but if they'd like to see how I use the system and pick stocks - we offer that as well.","We really believe in the earnings. We're very proud that often we do well in the down market. But you know, there are some markets where they just lose liquidity, like 2001, 2008.","I'm from Berkeley, California, so I'm fully trained in socialism and all, but basically what they teach you there is markets are efficient and we can't beat them, so we might as well index.","There's something we calculate called an alpha, and that's the stock's return that's independent, uncorrelated to the market. And the only way you really get a high alpha is for something to zig when the market zags.","Since we try and take a fairly buy-and-hold approach to our newsletter portfolios and don't sell at every whipsaw, we want to have a mix of stocks that will perform at both ends of the oscillation.","Large-caps were safe in 1996, '97, '98. Everybody was buying index funds and Nifty Fifty funds. As long as money was pouring in, it was great.","One of our big challenges with the newsletter is that everyone thinks big stocks are safe. That's not true at all. They're only safe if the money is flowing there.","I've been investing in the stock market for 27 years and, within that time, have helped investors beat the market nearly four to one.","Social Security was designed to give a few years of modest benefits to people whose bodies were worn out through coal mining, factory work and other physically demanding labor.","Open the borders to willing workers from any and all nations. They will create businesses that pay taxes, especially payroll taxes to fund Medicare and Social Security benefits of retiring baby boomers.","Don't punish small businesses with over-regulation.","There is a substantial correlation between an election year and how the market finishes.","Our system is dynamic, always shifting gears. What I do is I build models to beat the market.","As a rule, bond funds will not double your money overnight.","I almost always recommend investors get fully invested, since it's better to put your money to work than to let it simply track the rate of inflation.","Zeroing in on the best sectors or the best regions of the world is great, but zeroing in on the very best individual stocks is the key to making truly impressive profits."],"Louis Nizer":["A beautiful lady is an accident of nature. A beautiful old lady is a work of art.","A man who works with his hands is a laborer; a man who works with his hands and his brain is a craftsman; but a man who works with his hands and his brain and his heart is an artist.","I know of no higher fortitude than stubborness in the face of overwhelming odds.","A graceful taunt is worth a thousand insults.","When a man points a finger at someone else, he should remember that four of his fingers are pointing at himself.","Words of comfort, skillfully administered, are the oldest therapy known to man.","Yes, there's such a thing as luck in trial law but it only comes at 3 o'clock in the morning. You'll still find me in the library looking for luck at 3 o'clock in the morning.","We are slow to believe that which if believed would hurt our feelings.","Books are standing counselors and preachers, always at hand, and always disinterested; having this advantage over oral instructors, that they are ready to repeat their lesson as often as we please.","To find a fault is easy; to do better may be difficult."],"Louis Oosthuizen":["I pay attention to the sun. I've worn sunglasses while I play, for years, and apply sunscreen. No matter where I'm playing, there's a rain suit in my bag, too.","My putting strategy is simple: If you're not making putts, don't be afraid to change your technique.","Sometimes my backswing gets long, and I get in bad positions. The club also can get behind me coming down, so I have to flip my hands to catch up to my body.","Whenever I have a little time off, I try to go back to my farm in South Africa. I'll spend time with my family and hunt antelope, kudu and springbok. During a 2010 hunting trip, I tore some ligaments in my ankle when I stepped in a hole.","I usually have a few coins in my pocket when I'm playing, but the one I use to mark my ball on the green is a special silver coin that my wife designed for me. It has our wedding date inscribed on it.","It's the gap in the teeth. My friends say I look like Shrek - some of my friends - and you can't choose your friends, so what can I say?","I just go out there and play the game; I get on with things. Golf is not everything in life.","You have to be sharp with all aspects of your game at Augusta. You need to put yourself in the best spot off the tee and hit the longest drive you can, but I think this is really a second-shot course. If you leave yourself with an awkward putt on the greens, it can be very tricky here.","I like the course, the history - everything about St. Andrews.","I never try to set goals that I know are too tough to achieve or out of my reach.","I grew up in Mossel Bay in South Africa on the Garden Route. It's really windy there, and I like it. I enjoy links golf a lot.","You've got so much confidence if you start making big putts because you know you just need to hit the greens, and you've got yourself a good opportunity for the birdies.","I like it when it's nice and quiet. I'm not a big city person.","I just enjoy playing in wind, grew up in it, and it makes the golf a bit more fun.","On the practice green, I hit a lot of four-footers with my right hand only. But whatever grip I'm using, you can bet I'm feeling good about it. Otherwise, I'd change. That's how I avoid slumps."],"Louis Pasteur":["Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity, and is the torch which illuminates the world.","Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal. My strength lies solely in my tenacity.","Fortune favors the prepared mind.","When I approach a child, he inspires in me two sentiments; tenderness for what he is, and respect for what he may become.","One must work; one must work. I have done what I could.","It is surmounting difficulties that makes heroes.","There does not exist a category of science to which one can give the name applied science. There are science and the applications of science, bound together as the fruit of the tree which bears it.","Science is the highest personification of the nation because that nation will remain the first which carries the furthest the works of thought and intelligence.","The universe is asymmetric and I am persuaded that life, as it is known to us, is a direct result of the asymmetry of the universe or of its indirect consequences. The universe is asymmetric.","Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity, and is the torch which illuminates the world.

In school they made me leader of the orchestra because I played the violin, but I followed Leon and the boys in his jazz band around."],"Louis R. Chenevert":["The need for air transport is real, and it's not going to change. The key is to have the right business model and have the right initiatives, in my view, to succeed.","Goodrich was the biggest acquisition in the history of aerospace.","If you want to attract more investment, foreign investment, more talent, more business, I think having some level of certainty that the business environment respects, those who have been your partners for a long time, is important.","We produce motor drive electronics; we produce cargo systems for large narrow-body and wide-body airplanes and, more importantly, the emergency escape chute that goes on these planes.","You could look at people in India and say we are manufacturing the cabin that is going to be a part of the U.S. President's helicopter. That's a pretty big deal, right? There are 11 other heads of state who we support, but the fact is, to me, it's a very large deal.","I see opportunities in all my businesses. And the reason is simple. We thrive on countries that are urbanizing.","UTC Aerospace Systems has a couple of million dollars of content on every single aircraft that gets delivered. That's the chutes, the electric system, rotors, etc.","I'd manufactured more gearboxes probably in the aviation industry than anybody else.","We've flown the president since Eisenhower, and we're going to continue to fly the president for generations to come. This is something we're very proud of.","In my view, until the U.S. tax policy is revised, not just tax extenders but the reform of tax policy, it makes it very attractive for us to invest on acquisition overseas.","Boeing does a great job in introducing product that kind of changes the game.","UTC is very well positioned to take advantage of 2 large megatrends: urbanization and the fast-growing commercial aerospace market.","Goodrich is a perfect addition to our Hamilton Sundstrand business. And with a strong portfolio of complementary products, Goodrich also brought great leadership balance, great opportunities to provide more integrated systems.","I'm confident UTC could outperform in all of our markets, starting with our commercial businesses. The largest opportunities for our commercial businesses are in emerging markets, and we're very well positioned there.","Looking beyond the emerging markets, it is important not to lose sight of the growth opportunities that exist in the developed regions."],"Louis Sachar":["I never think of an entire book at once. I always just start with a very small idea. In 'Holes,' I just began with the setting; a juvenile correctional facility located in the Texas desert. Then I slowly make up the story, and rewrite it several times, and each time I rewrite it, I get new ideas, and change the old ideas around.","I didn't become a good writer until I learned how to rewrite. And I don't just mean fixing spelling and adding a comma. I rewrite each of my books five or six times, and each time I change huge portions of the story.","When I wrote 'Sideways Stories from Wayside School' I never expected it to be published. It was kind of a hobby. Now, it's a job, but it's a job I like very much.","I remember my fourth grade teacher reading 'Charlotte's Web' and 'Stuart Little' to us - both, of course, by E. B. White. His stories were genuinely funny, thought provoking and full of irony and charm. He didn't condescend to his readers, which was why I liked his books, and why I wasn't a big reader of other children's' books.","I want kids to think that reading can be just as much fun and more so than TV or video games or whatever else they do. I think any other kind of message or morals that I might teach is secondary to first just enjoying a book.","When I write a novel, every word is mine. I welcome suggestions from my editor, but in the end, I make all the final decisions.","I really began to love to read while in high school, and my favorite authors were my heroes: J.D. Salinger, Kurt Vonnegut.","I'm no good at describing my books. 'Holes' has been out now for seven years, and I still can't come up with a good answer when asked what that book is about.","The media tends to portray the teenage world as one where drinking and sex is taken for granted. In fact, I think most teenagers don't drink, are unsure of themselves, and feel awkward around members of the opposite sex.","Not counting 'Small Steps,' I think 'Holes' is my best book, in terms of plot, and setting, and the way the story revealed itself. It hasn't changed my life, other than that I have more money than I did before I wrote it. I'm still too close to 'Small Steps' to compare it to 'Holes.'","Every time I start a new novel, it seems like an impossible undertaking. If I tried to do too much too quickly, I would get lost and feel overwhelmed. I have to go slow, and give things a chance to take form and grow.","It's - I write the books and let the market find who reads it. I guess a young adult is anywhere from ten to fifteen.","I think what makes good children's books is putting the same care and effort into it as if I was writing for adults. I don't write anything - put anything in my books - that I'd be embarrassed to put in an adult book.","I actually started an adult book, worked on it for about two years, and then decided it just wasn't coming together for me, and thought I'll go back to children's books, and almost immediately I started 'Holes,' and it just seemed to take off on me.","I don't listen to music when I write. I need silence.","I'm an avid bridge player. I usually go to the local bridge club three or four times a week. I've always been a game-player, and I think bridge is one of the greatest games ever invented. It's too bad that not many young people play it any more.","I guess what led to me writing 'Holes' was having moved to Texas in 1991, and it was sort of my reaction to Texas.","Part of me becomes the characters I'm writing about. I think readers feel like they are there, the way I am, as a result.","My parents played bridge, and I remember being fascinated watching them. I sometimes got a chance to sit in on a hand, which I loved. But then I didn't actually play on my own for about 30 years.","I write in the mornings, two or three hours every day, and then at least four times a week I play in a duplicate game at a bridge club. I try to go to tournaments three, four, or five times a year.","I think of a book and a play, or a book and a movie, as two separate things - I don't think of it as my novel having a new life.","I don't think too much about the audience when I'm writing... I'm aware that 'Holes' was read by kids as young as 8, up to adults.","With 'Holes' I was troubled that there weren't very many female characters. I tried to put them in where I could. But the setting didn't lend itself to girls.","I jog in the morning and then write for about two hours. There are times when I'm really excited and can't wait to get back to it. But there are days when I don't know what's coming next, and I really have to force it.","'The Cardturner,' while it has bridge in it, you certainly don't need to know how to play bridge to read it. It's basically a book about relationships - between Alton and his great-uncle, and Alton and his friends, and how it changes his life."],"Louis Stokes":["Also, with information having just come out at the time about J. Edgar Hoover's electronic surveillance of Dr. King, it gave greater weight to the statements of those persons who were alleging involvement of the FBI.","Nowhere, absolutely nowhere, has there ever been a hint, not even a whisper, that a Black person was involved in the assassination of the president. But that's the kind of thing you have in this movie.","Our findings with reference to organized crime was that organized crime as an entity didn't participate in the assassination of the president. However, we were unable to preclude the possibility of individual members of organized crime having participated.","There was a man who was an associate of jimmy Hoffa, who testified against Hoffa in his trial down in Tennessee. We had information from him that he and Hoffa did, in fact, discuss the planning of an assassination conspiracy against Bobby Kennedy.","There is one instance that we cite in the report where in one of the conversations a member of organized crime is talking to another member of organized crime and he suggests that Attorney General Kennedy should be murdered.","Well we had nine top forensic pathologists from across the country, who operated as a panel, who looked at all the ballistic evidence and they came out saying that those bullets did exactly what the Warren Commission said they did.","One of the first things we found out was that the Warren Commission never pursued a conspiracy investigation.","In all, we investigated, I think, close to 50 rumors about offers to kill Dr. King around the country. But we found no evidence to support rumors of FBI involvement in the assassination.","But we did conclude that Ray had actually killed Dr. King pursuant to his theory that he was going to be able to get hold of that money. He had learned of this offer through his ties in the Missouri State Penitentiary.","There have been a couple of instances prior to now where members of the House have filed resolutions calling for release of the sealed files which were developed during the course of our committee's investigation.","Firstly, we have personnel records of persons we hired, persons we fired, reasons we fired them and so forth. These records have nothing to do with the assassination of the president and, therefore, ought to remain in the files.","There are, in the King case in particular, some names of confidential informants, persons to whom we promised confidentiality in return for their testimony. We have put their testimony in the public domain, but feel that their names should continue to be anonymous.","There are some classified documents there that we received from the CIA. Our arrangement with the CIA was that we could by mutual agreement declassify these documents, but we had no authority to unilaterally declassify them.","Well that's true, and what is actually happening now is that there are accusations that those records contain conspiratorial information that has been concealed from the American people and that is a dangerous situation that just cannot be tolerated.","The purpose of sealing the records was not to conceal them or to conceal the facts from the American people.","Now the interesting thing about the movie is that many of the questions it raised about the Warren Commission and its investigation were all investigated by our committee 13 years ago. We published our findings in 27 volumes of information and evidentiary material.","In my opinion, assassination theories will continue to revolve around these assassinations as they have around several other significant assassinations in American history. The assassination of President Lincoln comes to mind.","People are just fascinated by assassinations."],"Louis Sullivan":["What the people are within, the buildings express without.","Form follows function.","In the history of mankind there are recorded two great Inversions. The first, set forth by the Nazarene to the effect that love is a greater power and more real than vengeance. The second proclaimed the earth to be a sphere revolving in its course around the sun. These affirmations were made in the face of all evidence sacred to the contrary.","The building's identity resided in the ornament.","Implicit in true freedom of spirit lies a proud and virile will. Such glorious power of free will to choose, envisages beneficent social responsibility as manifest and welcome.","Man shall find his anchorage in self-recognition.","Once you learn to look at architecture not merely as an art more or less well or more or less badly done, but as a social manifestation, the critical eye becomes clairvoyant.","Words are most malignant, the most treacherous possession of mankind. They are saturated with the sorrows of all time.","If with open mind one reads and observes industriously and long; if in so doing one covers a wide field and so covering reflects in terms of realism, he is likely, soon or late, to be brought to a sudden consciousness that Man is an unknown quantity and his existence unsuspected.","It was the spirit animating the mass and flowing from it, and it expressed the individuality of the building.","It is the mass dream of inverted self, populous with fears overt and secret, that forms the continuous but gossamer thread upon which are strung as phantom beads all civilizations from the remotest past of record to that of the present day and hour.","The feudal concept of self-preservation is poisoned at the core by the virulent assumption of master and man, of potentate and slave, of external and internal suppression of the life urge of the only one - of its faith in human sacrifice as a means of salvation.","Alas, the world has never known a sound social fabric, a fabric sound and clean to the core and kindly. For it has ever turned its back on Man.","The problem of the tall office building is one of the most stupendous, one of the most magnificent opportunities that the Lord of Nature in His beneficence has ever offered to the proud spirit of man."],"Louis Susman":["I want to say unequivocally the Queen is magnificent. She is the enduring force, she is the glue that makes everyone feel good. She is beloved. I would rue the day when she may not be here.","In war and in peace, in prosperity and times of economic hardship, America has no better friend or more dependable ally than the United Kingdom.","You know it's easy to say you shouldn't do something and then something happens and you say, 'Wow, I wish I would have done something.'","Sometimes, I think I have the best job in the world.","The Americans' position is clear: we promote democracy.","I don't think anyone enjoys raising money, but for some reason I seem to have a knack.","David Cameron has a different style to Gordon Brown.","My wife and I are art collectors and architectural crazies.","The bond between the United States and Britain has always been strong. It has survived through war and peace, periods of prosperity and economic hardship.","In sport, Americans are prominent in the Premier League - both on and off the pitch."],"Louis Theroux":["There's obviously a lot of controversy around the issue of hunting as there is around gambling, and I like these stories where there is a moral dimension, stories that force you to think about your prejudices about a subject and explore the extent to which they are justified.","A lot of money could be saved if we ate urban wildlife.","I never misrepresent my position - you've got to be strong enough to make the argument and marshal the case.","I feel like, if there's an elephant in the room, I'd really like to start off by introducing the elephant in the room. And sometimes it's funny.","I don't go around saturated in guilt or anything like that. I do worry about things quite a lot, but I don't feel as though I am a bad person.","I think everybody carries a slight sense of being different, and I know that it comes very naturally to me.","Funnily enough, the most danger I felt was when I did a story about exotic animals kept as pets in America.","There's always a negotiation that goes on to persuade people we are coming to the subject with an open mind but without surrendering too many pawns. We don't want to misrepresent the fact that we will draw our own conclusions.","I'm not that comfortable doing polemic or being strident.","Sometimes people think I'm sort of a Machiavelli who is thinking, 'How can I disarm people? I know: I'll create a persona; I'll get some spectacles, and when I meet you, I'll say, 'How are you doing?' And I will be very unassuming and polite and never get angry.'","I am genuinely a bit confused about the world, a little bit bumbling.","Do I care about clothes and stuff? Not much. It's a bit sick, isn't it, people spending all that money on clothes? I'm too stingy. I wouldn't pay £100 for a shirt.","Meeting forensic patients for the first time could occasionally be an unnerving experience. They often came across as mild and gentle people, but the details of the crimes were harrowing in the extreme.","I've got an interest in Zimbabwe. I spent a few months there before uni, so I'd like to get back to that.","I think Donald Trump's had a pattern of leaping on the bandwagon of anything that he feels will further his candidacy, and if that means sowing more fear and paranoia and playing into a kind of xenophobic populist strain, then that's what he will do.","Most people feel that they are the heroes of their own lives and that they're good people. So if they're in a crisis, they feel an understandable urge to set out their own version of events.","There is no religion that has a monopoly on bigotry.","When you're in your 40s, you become more conscious of life being of limited duration and that you need to create memories and go on little adventures from time to time.","There have been times when I've felt inappropriately emotional. I remember making 'The Most Hated Family in America' about the Westboro Baptist Church, and being on the way to a funeral of a U.S. soldier with the Phelps family; they were going to picket the funeral.","I am genuinely slightly vague and chaotic in my habits. For good or ill, you know.","I really do try not to emote. I don't like seeing it on documentaries - it seems a bit unprofessional. I also need to be human being and be a kind of sympathetic presence for the contributors I'm with, so there' a line you have to walk.","Arguably, there's an emotional side of life that I'm not always completely plugged into.","I'm not pugnacious or argumentative. I'd probably feel fear going into a pub in the Outback.","The documentary genre, shows like 'Making a Murderer' and 'The Jinx' on HBO, there's been a whole raft of long-form docs.","The thing is, I have never been that confident, and, um, I have a lot of self-doubt, and I had never - I don't think I ever would have consciously chosen to be a television presenter.","L.A. is the opposite of Britain in a lot of respects, and that's what draws so many British people here.","I think people are so immersed in the anti-Scientology mindset by consuming tabloid media and stories about space aliens. It's baffling. When I say I want to see a more positive side of the church, all I'm saying is I want to get past these headlines that talk about aliens and Tom Cruise jumping on a sofa.","I think there's a feeling of - a grassroots feeling of being betrayed by the elites in some way: that the system is working for itself and not for the people at the bottom.","I've always slightly harboured a dream of making a film, a documentary feature. Somehow, I just got into a way of working a routine of making TV docs.","As a father of two children, I am used to seeing kids in the midst of a five-alarm meltdown over the choice of DVD or the necessity of broccoli.","Sometimes you shoot for 40 or 50 hours for a one-hour show, and you have to make some very hard choices.","As much as the glasses, it's the Englishness and the gangliness. The apparent lack of muscularity... they indicate I'm not a macho man.","We have a double agenda of trying to deliver something exciting that people will talk about and will brighten their day and will amaze people and make us proud to have created an object of beauty. And on the other hand being true to the story.","I've always enjoyed painting, but I went to teach in schools in Zimbabwe instead.","There is no shame is being ambivalent about almost everything in your life.","There are fear mongers who talk about Islam as somehow it is an incubator of hate... remember Christians, like the Westboro Baptist Church, are just as capable of promoting intolerance.","I have been to a few A-list parties, but not massively. It's not my life, but it's fun dipping into it.","You can talk to someone relatively famous, and they say, 'What do you do? What do you do for a job?' and I say, 'I make documentaries for the BBC,' and you see their eyes just glaze over.","You can say, 'I am a poet, rock-climbing shaman, and my name is Hiawatha Moonbeam,' and people in America will say, 'Hey, that's great. All power to you, man'.","I think what I'm good at is getting to know people and trying to build a relationship over a few weeks and trying to get to the truth.","I don't like that feeling of holding back difficult questions. I feel like the more I can be transparent in the way I approach a story, the more it makes a satisfying programme.","Sometimes I feel a bit socially disconnected in terms of being a little bit gullible about how people interrelate emotionally.","Clearly I'm able to read emotions. But I do feel... What is it? Awkwardness. I'm not a slick dude. That's what it comes down to. The nakedness, the guilelessness... that's quite real.","When interviews are too cosy, I don't enjoy them.","Although my dad's a writer, we grew up in a telly-watching household. I never found him disparaging about television.","I've always seen TV as... it didn't occupy the same rarefied space as literature, but it's art you can use day to day. I've never been hung up on where it figures in the hierarchy of learning.","I just follow the subjects I'm interested in.","I'm not trying to acquire a reputation as serious documentary maker for its own sake.","People say I'm deceptively unassuming, but that's the way I go through life. I'm not flash. You can make it sound calculated, but it's pretty much just me.","I like eating food after it's gone off.","I'm not necessarily scanning for clues when I make documentaries.","Empires will come and go. The Soviet Union collapses; China can become a superpower, but 'Blue Peter' stays the same.","As a BBC broadcaster, I really do hope that the new incarnation of 'Top Gear' with Chris Evans does well.","It's in the DNA of Scientology that they don't trust journalists.","All religions are, in some basic sense, irrational.","Scientology is not that different from other religions. And yet, at the same time, we don't have Anglicans doing the things that are alleged to be done in Scientology, at least in the Sea Org.","I think of myself as being quite affable, approachable, fairly easy to get to know.","I think I have a slight fear of intimacy.","I was always attracted and repelled by the idea of being a writer.","I both admired my father and his writing, and I saw how much he valued it.","My guilty fear is that what I'm doing, probably anyone could do. And that I just got a lot of lucky breaks.","One of the things I have always enjoyed about Scientology is their proactive approach to journalists who are covering them.","Not counting the brand of Sunni Islam practised by the so-called Islamic State, there is probably no religion in the world that comes in for more flak than Scientology.","True believers of Scientology seem to know with utmost certainty that they have found the answer to the deepest riddles of all time - they may or may not be right, but that kind of self-belief is very appealing.","After studying the subject for years, watching countless YouTube videos of Scientology handlers filming critics and journalists, it felt amazing to be on the receiving end myself: I felt like I'd been blooded.","In the past, I've tried to show the human side of people involved in stigmatised or misunderstood lifestyles. I've tried to resist easy judgments and not pander to prejudices.","I try not to be too judgmental.","If I actually invited someone to make a documentary about me, and I said, 'Anything goes', and then I refused to answer any questions, that would be inconsistent.","I don't think I'm afraid of anything.","I think he could win, absolutely. I think he could win because there's Trump supporters out there who aren't even revealing themselves as such. For me, that's a scary prospect because I think he'd be a disastrous president.","In my normal way of doing things, there's a little bit of 'going native' that takes place, where you're in a world long enough, you can't really help but start to see things in a nuanced, more humanistic way. Just because you're with people and you start to, in general, slightly like the people you're with.","When you don't have access to a subject, and all you have is ex-members and critics, there is this gravitational pull toward telling a certain version of events. Scientology would say this, and they have a point, that it's like doing a portrait of a marriage in which you're only hearing from the ex-wife and not the ex-husband.","Prisons and jails, I tend to feel that you're actually safer as a journalist than you might think, certainly more than it appears.","When it was time to meet a chimpanzee, I got very, very anxious because they have the strength of ten men, so I hear.","It's in the DNA of all the shows that I have done that are about people that are dealing with very stressful situations that are giving them a lot of angst.","I don't feel that as human beings we have an obligation to dislike someone based on their beliefs, and it's OK to have a human reaction to someone even if you feel what they do is hideous and objectionable. You can still enjoy their company and find them interesting to be around.","The trouble is, I just don't know if I'm too human or not human enough.","I tell people I live in Harlesden in north-west London, and I can see them thinking, 'Why do you live there?'","Look after your body, because I'm 44, and things are happening that I never dreamed of - like bad joints and man boobs!","It's difficult to describe the weirdness of speaking to a man who appears to be perfectly in control of his faculties, who can deliver off-the-cuff repartee, and yet who is actually utterly disconnected from who he is.","Reflecting the truth sounds easy, but sometimes it's not.","It is important to note that most of the patients in Ohio's mental health facilities have never committed crimes. They are institutionalised because they have lost touch with reality and are having problems functioning unaided in the community.","I've discovered I am quite a puritanical person.","Some things should remain private.","Hunting really divides people in Britain. We keep pets, and we name our animals, but we're not too worried about industrial hunting practices.","Big game hunters and the hunting industry in South Africa know a lot of people regard what they do as terrible, and the media have tended not to do them any favours. So it was an uphill struggle to win trust from the people and to get into the world.","The many ways of getting content for free have slashed the profits of the professionals in their respective fields.","I sometimes get accused of being 'faux-naive,' but for me, it's really just about getting down to the basics of something.","I don't like watching things where I think the people onscreen are ahead of me or assuming I know something that I don't know.","I didn't think, 'I'd really like to work in TV; maybe I could carve out a niche where I talk to people who are somehow involved in marginal or difficult lifestyles... ' It was something I gravitated to very naturally as a subject area, almost instinctively, and somehow turned into a TV career without meaning to.","In west London where I live, white people are a minority. In the area I am in, which is the borough of Brent, whites are less than 50%.","I am always drawn to things that feel different to what I would experience at home: things that offer a combination of unfamiliarity and a sort of bleak glamour. I think the outback has that.","I would love to make a film in the outback or in Papua New Guinea, in Port Moresby. I know that it's not in Australia, but it's not too far.","'Cunnamulla' is a beautifully bleak portrait of a lonely town in which people are leading lives of sort of quiet desperation.","I never thought I would really like to be on television, and the story of me getting into it was quite lucky, really, just a series of chance encounters. So I am not exactly putting myself across as a celebrity, although people might perceive me that way.","Celebrity is quite a fraught word. It is not something I aspire to, but I can certainly see why it could be.","I never want to feel more than the viewers. I'm not trying to be an automaton. It's like when you see people laughing on camera, and you don't find it funny as a viewer - it's an offputting experience.","For publicity purposes, everything gets simplified, and the fact that I wear glasses and am somewhat bookish makes me a geek. That's fine; there needs to be a shorthand, but there are important geek traits that I don't really share.","I'm following my interests, and there's something about investigating the world and creating a watchable, entertaining programme out of it that is deeply satisfying."],"Louis Tomlinson":["Live life for the moment because everything else is uncertain!","I'm a very loyal boyfriend. I'm a bit of a joker... I can be romantic, but not too sickly.","To be honest, I don't think I'm the best role model in the world. I'm pretty immature sometimes.","If you want to do something, go for it -you've got nothing to lose.","My favorite music isn't necessarily the songs that One Direction come out with. That doesn't mean to say I don't secretly really love some of our songs, which I do.","I like someone who doesn't take life too seriously. I hate people who are a bit uptight.","You can lay in bed and think you don't stand a chance, that's what all of us thought, and here we are. We ended up doing all right.","All our fans are always very loud, especially Scousers.","In week one of the 'X Factor,' just to be a little bit quirky, I decided to say that I like girls who eat carrots. Ever since I've had lots and lots and lots of carrots.","I'm not great with money. I'd go crazy if I were left to my own devices. My mum and girlfriend sort it out. I'm not driven by it, but I love to be generous.","But you know we couldn't compare what we do with what the British athletes did at the Olympics. We are very proud to be British and if we have done our bit to promote Britain in a historic year for the country that's brilliant.","I like kisses that aren't too fast or rushed - that's what makes a good kiss.","I will confess I am a great wingman. Since I have a girlfriend, I'll start the night with her, but then I'll help out the guys by making them sound like the most incredible guys in the world.","I'm a bit old-fashioned. I like the idea of going to the cinema and then an Italian restaurant.","It's important for me to treat a girlfriend with respect. My mum would be horrified if I behaved any differently - and I have sisters, and would hate for them to be treated badly by guys.","I am going slightly deaf in my right ear. It's tinnitus... something like that.","All my mates are at university, and it's a life I haven't had a chance to enjoy, so it's great to turn up and sample a bit of it.","I like a girl who doesn't take life too seriously and is quite easy-going.","For me, Robbie Williams was a massive influence when I was growing up. But also Cheryl Cole. Being in her presence was intimidating, because she's so hot.","I feel very honored to have been asked to sign for Rovers, and being able to help both the club and the amazing charity Bluebell Wood is what it's all about.","Zayn's good to just sit down and chat to about pretty much anything. At the end of the night, we just sit around and talk about our life before One Direction, or anything at all, really.","I can't really cook, but the first dish I ever made was for my girlfriend, Eleanor. I made chicken breast wrapped in ham, homemade mashed potatoes, and gravy.","My favorite music isn't necessarily the songs that One Direction come out with. That doesn't mean to say I don't secretly really love some of our songs, which I do. My personal tastes... I actually like quite a bit acoustic and more mellow kinds of things.","I quite like American music, like The Fray - I'm a massive fan of them - and The Killers. I also like more acoustic stuff like Ed Sheeran; I like this English songwriter James Morrison and another singer called Ben Howard.","We don't dance because we can't dance. Our shows, production-wise, are always quite minimal. We always try and keep it more about us having fun and stay away from gimmicks.","My personal tastes... I actually like quite a bit acoustic and more mellow kinds of things. I quite like American music, like The Fray, I'm a massive fan of them, and The Killers.","I want to see the Doncaster Rovers supporters get the club the success it deserves.","I grew up in Doncaster and have felt the love for football run through the town; it's for that reason that I have a real personal passion to make Doncaster Rovers a success story.","I just like really simple things. If I had been on tour for a while and I got to come back and take my girlfriend Eleanor on a date, we would go to the cinema and then out for dinner.","One thing that I miss because we spend a lot of time in America is English food, like cooked breakfast and Sunday dinners."],"Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.":["It's about communication. It's about honesty. It's about treating people in the organization as deserving to know the facts. You don't try to give them half the story. You don't try to hide the story. You treat them as - as true equals, and you communicate and you communicate and communicate.","Watch the turtle. He only moves forward by sticking his neck out.","Computers are magnificent tools for the realization of our dreams, but no machine can replace the human spark of spirit, compassion, love, and understanding.","Reorganization to me is shuffling boxes, moving boxes around. Transformation means that you're really fundamentally changing the way the organization thinks, the way it responds, the way it leads. It's a lot more than just playing with boxes.","The real mechanism for corporate governance is the active involvement of the owners.","What I'm trying to do is deliver results, not promises; results, not vision; results, not concepts. The world is cynical about IBM's promises.","People don't do what you expect but what you inspect.","The networked world offers the promise that maybe the information technology industry will start to, for the first time in a decade or so, address CEO-level issues.","I think that my leadership style is to get people to fear staying in place, to fear not changing.","The world is full of CEOs that think that just because they write a memo or they write a letter inside an annual report or they give a little video speech that gets sent around the company, they think that's what's really going to affect employees.","Successful enterprises are built from the ground up. You can't assemble them with a bunch of acquisitions.","If life was so easy that you could just go buy success, there would be a lot more successful companies in the world.","This really is a merger of equals. I wouldn't have come back to work for anything less than this fantastic opportunity. This lets me combine my two great loves - technology and biscuits.","I initially wanted to be a teacher, and then I was going to become an engineer and build bridges and highways, but pretty soon I went into the business world. I never did get to be a teacher except in a different way.","I want to become a student. I want to read Chinese history and go on a dig.","You can never be comfortable with your success, you've got to be paranoid you're going to lose it.","The next thing is: we can make IBM even better. We brought IBM back but we're gunning for leadership.","The value that some analysts put on revenue vs. what they put on profit is out of whack. If you can grow real cash earnings, that's 80% of what you ought to do, and the revenue component is 20%.","Compensation needs to be predominately performance-driven. If CEO compensation was performance-driven, which I believe it was in IBM's case, nobody would ever argue. If the shareholders didn't make billions and billions of dollars, I wouldn't make millions of dollars.","You know, you don't need a leader to sort of administer something that's going very well. In fact, in one sense, an overly ambitious person in that circumstance can probably screw it up.","Whether the task is fixing health care, upgrading K-12 education, bolstering national security, or a host of other missions, the U.S. is better at patching problems than fixing them.","Visit USA.gov and you'll find thousands of directorates, agencies, boards, offices, and services replete with overlapping responsibilities, ancient priorities, and divided accountability.","We do not need Departments of Commerce, Labor, and Education; we need a single Department of Skills that will promote an integrated approach to global competitiveness.","Our military should be trained and structured around missions, not the elements of air, water, and land.","I'm leery of legislative solutions to what is morality.","If CEO compensation was performance-driven, which I believe it was in IBM's case, nobody would ever argue. If the shareholders didn't make billions and billions of dollars, I wouldn't make millions of dollars. My salary was the same for 10 years. It was all performance-based.","I've been accepted at Cambridge University. I want to study Chinese history and archaeology. I want to become a student. I want to read Chinese history and go on a dig.","The Internet is ultimately about innovation and integration, but you don't get the innovation unless you integrate Web technology into the processes by which you run your business.","What we believe is going to be very important is the delivery of traditional software and services and hardware over the Net. That's a form of electronic marketplace.","I want to take IBM back to its roots.","The fundamental issue is: In the world of the Internet, is there a place for a packager of services? Does the customer want to go surf the Net and go to every one of 50,000 Web sites? Or will people pay a reasonable amount for somebody to go out and preselect and package what they want? My guess is they will both coexist.","When a manufacturing company in Spain looks to IBM for a solution to a problem, they expect us to bring the best of IBM worldwide to it, not just the experience of IBM Spain.","I firmly believe that IBM's size can be used to its advantage.","When I arrived at IBM, there were 'Team' signs all around. I asked, 'How do people get paid?' They told me, 'We pay people based on individual performance.'","Quite frankly, I am not very comfortable in chitchat. When I go to board meetings, I arrive two minutes before and leave when it's over. I don't stay for lunch or go early and have coffee.","My parents worked enormously hard to put four children through college. We didn't have a lot of money.","A lot of people saved IBM. Yes, I was the leader of that team, but I could never have done it without a group of IBMers helping me."],"Louis XIV":["It is legal because I wish it.","I am the state.","Every time I appoint someone to a vacant position, I make a hundred unhappy and one ungrateful.","There is little that can withstand a man who can conquer himself.","The ministers of kings should learn to moderate their ambition. The higher they elevate themselves above their proper sphere, the greater the danger that they will fall.","It is impossible to please all the world.","I could sooner reconcile all Europe than two women.","First feelings are always the most natural.","We can do all we wish while we live; afterward, we are less than the meanest.","I have made my will; I have been tormented to do it. I have bought repose; I know the powerlessness and inutility of it.","You have only to see what became of my father's will immediately after his death, and the wills of so many other kings. I know it well; but nevertheless, they have wished it; they gave me no rest nor repose, no calm until it was done.","My child, you are going to be a great king; do not imitate me in the taste I have had for building, or in that I have had for war; try, on the contrary, to be at peace with your neighbors.","As for restitutions, to nobody in particular do I owe any, but as for those I owe to the realm, I hope in the mercy of God.","Ah, if I were not king, I should lose my temper.","The Pyrenees are no more.","Render to God what you owe him; recognize the obligations you are under to him.","I am dying, but the state remains.","Laws are the sovereigns of sovereigns.","Always follow good counsels.","My court was divided between peace and war according to their various interests, but I considered only their reasons.","The King of Spain displayed his esteem for me in a manner that I confess flattered me pleasantly when, after the death of Don Luis de Haro, he stated publicly in front of all the foreign ambassadors that he wanted to follow my example in not having a prime minister any longer.","That's what troubles me: I should like to suffer more for the expiation of my sins.","Has God forgotten all I have done for Him."],"Louis XVIII of France":["Punctuality is the politeness of kings.","A king should die on his feet."],"Louis Zamperini":["That's one thing you learn in sports. You don't give up; you fight to the finish.","Hate is self-destructive. If you hate somebody, you're not hurting the person you hate. You're hurting yourself. And that's a healing. Actually, it's a real healing, forgiveness.","When you're on a raft, you pray like in a foxhole.","All I did was pray to God, every day. In prison camp, the main prayer was, 'Get me home alive, God, and I'll seek you and serve you.' I came home, got wrapped up in the celebration, and forgot about the hundreds of promises I'd made to God.","I've got to say that is - the highest emotion of the human experience is going down in a plane knowing your going to die!","If you hate somebody, it's like a boomerang that misses its target and comes back and hits you in the head. The one who hates is the one who hurts.","'Unbroken' was published as a help to society.","Every soldier should learn survival on land, sea, and in the air.","I was a rotten kid. My excitement came from seeing what I could get away with.","I couldn't speak English. I'm in kindergarten, and the only reason I got through to first grade is because I cheated.","I ended up in the Army Air Corps in the Pacific, operating out of Ayuka field in Hawaii."],"Louis de Bernieres":["The human heart likes a little disorder in its geometry.","In reality the world is as full of bad mothers as it is of bad fathers, and it is not the motherless children who become delinquent but the fatherless ones.","What keeps me going is my children.","People taking photographs of their meals are not critics; they are from the United States.","Like many men, I am not ashamed to admit that my principal joys are domestic. I love cooking, and I love looking after my children. Indeed, the times that I have with them are the only ones when I feel unconditionally happy.","So the news that divorced fathers are to be denied a legal right to a relationship with their children, in the long overdue review of family law published this week, fills me with horror and despair.","An adversarial family law system raises the stakes unnecessarily high, exacerbates the antagonism of the couples concerned, and is directly responsible for making it impossible for couples who would otherwise have reconciled to do so.","Setting up a community and seeing what happens to it when the megalomaniacs get busy: that's my main preoccupation.","When you have children it completely shifts your focus; they become the most passionate love of your life.","Family law is institutionally anti-male. I've been lobbying MPs, and I'm not going to give up campaigning for equality until I get equality.","The De Bernieres were very military. I broke the military tradition but I was terribly proud of my father being a soldier."],"Louis de Broglie":["The electron can no longer be conceived as a single, small granule of electricity; it must be associated with a wave, and this wave is no myth; its wavelength can be measured and its interferences predicted.","For X-rays, the phenomenon of diffraction by crystals was a natural consequence of the idea that X-rays are waves analogous to light and differ from it only by having a smaller wavelength."],"Louis-Ferdinand Celine":["Experience is a dim lamp, which only lights the one who bears it.","Life is filigree work. What is written clearly is not worth much, it's the transparency that counts.","The poetry of heroism appeals irresistibly to those who don't go to a war, and even more to those whom the war is making enormously wealthy. It's always so.","Almost every desire a poor man has is a punishable offence.","Truth is a pain which will not stop. And the truth of this world is to die. You must choose: either dying or lying. Personally, I have never been able to kill myself.","If you aren't rich you should always look useful.","With two thousand years of Christianity behind him... a man can't see a regiment of soldiers march past without going off the deep end. It starts off far too many ideas in his head.","One can't relive one's life. Forgiveness is not what's difficult; one's always too ready to forgive. And it does no good, that's obvious.","We've no use for intellectuals in this outfit. What we need is chimpanzees. Let me give you a word of advice: never say a word to us about being intelligent. We will think for you, my friend. Don't forget it.","To philosophize is only another way of being afraid and leads hardly anywhere but to cowardly make-believe.","To hell with reality! I want to die in music, not in reason or in prose. People don't deserve the restraint we show by not going into delirium in front of them. To hell with them!"],"Louisa Hall":["Anne Elliot was the one Jane Austen character I didn't fall in love with. She seemed sad and defeated.","I think that a lot of people I'm close to feel that they went through a period of real difficulty when they moved away from home... You do have to reinvent yourself, and people have to struggle with that. It was really a struggle for me.","I've learned to compensate for my small size.","Female poets in the 17th century had these very confined, restricted lives.","The idea of a piece of literature as a vessel that could contain your life and lived after you had died and been forgotten struck me as akin to artificial intelligence."],"Louisa May Alcott":["I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning how to sail my ship.","Happy is the son whose faith in his mother remains unchallenged.","Far away there in the sunshine are my highest aspirations. I may not reach them, but I can look up and see their beauty, believe in them, and try to follow where they lead.","I am not afraid of storms for I am learning how to sail my ship.","We all have our own life to pursue, our own kind of dream to be weaving, and we all have the power to make wishes come true, as long as we keep believing.","Good books, like good friends, are few and chosen; the more select, the more enjoyable.","Have regular hours for work and play; make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well. Then youth will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and life will become a beautiful success.","Painful as it may be, a significant emotional event can be the catalyst for choosing a direction that serves us - and those around us - more effectively. Look for the learning.","Money is the root of all evil, and yet it is such a useful root that we cannot get on without it any more than we can without potatoes.","You have a good many little gifts and virtues, but there is no need of parading them, for conceit spoils the finest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long, and the great charm of all power is modesty.","Conceit spoils the finest genius. There is not much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long; even if it is, the consciousness of possessing and using it well should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power is modesty.","Women have been called queens for a long time, but the kingdom given them isn't worth ruling.","A faithful friend is a strong defense; And he that hath found him hath found a treasure.","A little kingdom I possess, where thoughts and feelings dwell; And very hard the task I find of governing it well.","It takes people a long time to learn the difference between talent and genius, especially ambitious young men and women.","Housekeeping ain't no joke.","She had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners.","Love is a great beautifier.","Let my name stand among those who are willing to bear ridicule and reproach for the truth's sake, and so earn some right to rejoice when the victory is won.","I like to help women help themselves, as that is, in my opinion, the best way to settle the woman question. Whatever we can do and do well we have a right to, and I don't think any one will deny us.","It takes two flints to make a fire.","Do the things you know, and you shall learn the truth you need to know.","He who believes is strong; he who doubts is weak. Strong convictions precede great actions.","People don't have fortunes left them in that style nowadays; men have to work and women to marry for money. It's a dreadfully unjust world.","Work is and always has been my salvation and I thank the Lord for it.","'Stay' is a charming word in a friend's vocabulary.","Father asked us what was God's noblest work. Anna said men, but I said babies. Men are often bad, but babies never are.","What do girls do who haven't any mothers to help them through their troubles?","Girls are so queer you never know what they mean.

I prize that difference.","I think most artists create out of despair. The very nature of creation is not a performing glory on the outside, it's a painful, difficult search within.","I think all great innovations are built on rejections.","The freer that women become, the freer men will be. Because when you enslave someone, you are enslaved."],"Louise Bogan":["Stupidity always accompanies evil. Or evil, stupidity.","Your work is carved out of agony as a statue is carved out of marble.","The intellectual is a middle-class product; if he is not born into the class he must soon insert himself into it, in order to exist. He is the fine nervous flower of the bourgeoisie.","Innocence of heart and violence of feeling are necessary in any kind of superior achievement: The arts cannot exist without them.","But childhood prolonged, cannot remain a fairyland. It becomes a hell.","No more pronouncements on lousy verse. No more hidden competition. No more struggling not to be a square.","Because language is the carrier of ideas, it is easy to believe that it should be very little else than such a carrier."],"Louise Bourgeois":["My art is a form of restoration in terms of my feelings to myself and to others.","Space is something that you have to define. Otherwise, it is like anxiety, which is too vague. A fear is something specific. I like claustrophobic spaces, because at least then you know your limits.","I have kept a diary as long as I can remember, and drawings are really another kind of diary.","Tell your own story, and you will be interesting.","Look at it this way - a totem pole is just a decorated tree. My work is a confessional.","My childhood has never lost its mystery, and it has never lost its drama.","I was raised a Catholic. But I am not religious. In my work, I am interested in real flesh and blood.","I was a 'runaway girl' from France who married an American and moved to New York City. I'm not sure I would have continued as an artist had I remained in Paris because of the family setup.","Even though what I do does enter the market, it doesn't interest me. I am exclusively concerned with the formal qualities of my work. It is about the need and the right to self-expression.","To express your emotions, you have to be very loose and receptive. The unconscious will come to you if you have that gift that artists have. I only know if I'm inspired by the results.","I don't watch TV. I don't use a computer, a fax or a cellphone.","I have drawn my whole life. My parents were in the tapestry restoration business, and as a young girl, I would draw in the missing parts of the tapestry that needed to be rewoven.","I know that when I finish a drawing, my anxiety level decreases. The realistic drawings are a way of pinning down an idea. I don't want to loose it. With the abstract drawings, when I'm feeling loose, I can slip into the unconscious.","When my mother died, I fell apart. My father wanted to control me. As a consequence, I ran away to America."],"Louise Brooks":["I have a gift for enraging people, but if I ever bore you it will be with a knife.","The great art of films does not consist of descriptive movement of face and body but in the movements of thought and soul transmitted in a kind of intense isolation.","Most beautiful dumb girls think they are smart and get away with it, because other people, on the whole, aren't much smarter.","In my dreams I am not crippled. In my dreams, I dance.","Every actor has a natural animosity toward every other actor, present or absent, living or dead.","I never gave away anything without wishing I had kept it; nor kept it without wishing I had given it away.","There is no other occupation in the world that so closely resembled enslavement as the career of a film star."],"Louise Brown":["The importance and influence of books on me has been cumulative: the result of hearing and reading lots of stories about interesting people and places.","Never give up. And most importantly, be true to yourself. Write from your heart, in your own voice, and about what you believe in.","The richest most meaningful stories are found in small places: made, carried, crafted, told, and retold by apparently unimportant people.","If you can't return a favor, pass it on.","When I was a child and teenager I read whenever I had the opportunity, but since then I've found it hard to read as much as I'd like, children, work, and pets all providing powerful incentives to escape into a book and a practical reason why I rarely do so.","When dad told me Mr Steptoe had passed away, I broke down.","Then I obviously didn't understand what it all meant, but I do now.","The young women in my classes are feisty and clever and believe, often with the passion of youthful optimism, that feminism is a battle already won. I worry for them - and for my daughters, too.","The Dancing Girls of Lahore was offered to dozens of British publishers and was turned down by everyone. It is still on offer in the U.K., but I'm not confident there will be any takers.","Sometimes I like to play the soundtracks to famous musicals so we can all sing along. South Pacific is one of my favorites. Our neighbors must hate us.","Remember that what you have is unique because it's your own special way of looking at the world.","Reading is my greatest luxury.","People still come up to me and ask whether I am Louise Brown or if they've seen me somewhere else before.","Much of my reading time over the last decade and a half has been spent reading aloud to my children. Those children's bedtime rituals of supper, bath, stories, and sleep have been a staple of my life and some of the best, most special times I can remember.","It took a brave editor in the U.S. to sign a contract for Dancing Girls, and without her belief in the book, I'm not sure it would ever have found its way into print.","I'm working on a nonfiction book on Nepal and a novel about diasporas.","I used to think about how I was conceived quite a lot when I was about 10 or 11, but I don't think about it at all now that so many other babies have been born in the same way.","I thought it was something peculiar to me. I thought I was abnormal.","I never felt any different from anyone else though.","I like many types of music and probably too many to mention here.","I have a good collection of cookery books. This is not so much because I like cooking, but because I like eating.","I don't envy men and I certainly wouldn't like to become one now.","I could write an entertaining novel about rejection slips, but I fear it would be overly long.","I can't pick out one single book that had such a profound personal impact.","I bought a selection of short, romantic fiction novels, studied them, decided that I had found a formula and then wrote a book that I figured was the perfect story. Thank goodness it was rejected.","Every year I teach dozens of students at the University of Birmingham. Most of the students on the gender and sexuality courses are women. I guess this is because the boys don't think that gender applies to them: that it's a subject for girls.","Don't write the book you think publishers want to commission. Plenty of other writers will be doing the same thing."],"Louise Erdrich":["I was in love with the whole world and all that lived in its rainy arms.","My mother is Turtle Mountain Chippewa, and she lived on her home reservation. My father taught there. He had just been discharged from the Air Force. He went to school on the GI Bill and got his teaching credentials. He is adventurous - he worked his way through Alaska at age seventeen and paid for his living expenses by winning at the poker table.","I grew up in North Dakota around Dakota and Ojibwe people, and also small-town people in Wahpeton. Writers make few choices, really, about their material. We have to write about what comes naturally and what interests us - so I do.","I'd love to meet my ancestors. I'd love to be able to speak to them.","Revenge is a sorrow for the person who has to take it on. And the person who is rash enough to think it's going to help a situation is always wrong.","Here I am, where I ought to be. A writer must have a place where he or she feels this, a place to love and be irritated with.","Love won't be tampered with, love won't go away. Push it to one side and it creeps to the other.","I got well by talking. Death could not get a word in edgewise, grew discouraged, and traveled on.","It was enough just to sit there without words.","Columbus only discovered that he was in some new place. He didn't discover America.","You know, some people fall right through the hole in their lives. It's invisible, but they come to it after time, never knowing where.","I have never fully exorcised shames that struck me to the heart as a child except through written violence, shadowy caricature, and dark jokes.","My father is my biggest literary influence. Recently, I've been looking through his letters. He was in the National Guard when I was a child, and whenever he left, he would write to me. He wrote letters to me all through college, and we still correspond. His letters, and my mother's, are one of my life's treasures.","My grandfather was a persuasive man who made friends with people at every level of influence. In order to fight against our tribe's termination, he went to newspapers and politicians and urged them to advocate for our tribe in Washington. He also supported his family through the Depression as a truck farmer.","On any state elections map, the reservations are blue places. Native people are most often progressives, Democrats, and by no means gun-toting vigilantes.","My parents' marriage is a gift to everyone around them - 60 years of making their kids laugh. How many parents are actually funny?","Most writers have been influenced by Faulkner.","Talking about how I might write the next book is like talking about whether or not to have sex. Any dithering ruins it.","There are several kinds of land on reservations. And all of these pieces of land have different entities who are in charge of enforcing laws on this land.","I grew up in Wahpeton, N.D., and I didn't leave until I was 18, and I've kept going back.","What I see in the book is an exquisite form of technology: one that doesn't require a power source and can be passed from hand to hand and lasts a lot longer than an electronic reader.","Nothing I force myself to write about ever turns out well, and so I've learned to wait for the voice, the incident, the image that reverberates.","I rarely step on sidewalk cracks. I don't wear a watch. I touch my favorite tree before going on long trips.","I write first drafts by hand. Never do I open an umbrella inside the house. I don't predict wins or losses. I used to stand on a certain piece of rug if my brothers and husband were watching football and their team got in trouble - but now the luck went out of that rug. If a circle is involved, I try to go clockwise.","Nothing I write ever has a moral. If it seems to a reader that there is one, that is unintentional.","When I moved to Minnesota, I found there was a thriving and determined movement, a grassroots movement, to revitalize the Ojibwe language. And I've never come to be a competent speaker. I have to say that right now. But even learning the amount of Ojibwe that one can at my age is a life-altering experience.","I live on the margin of just about everything. I'm a marginal person, and I think that is where I've become comfortable. I'm marginally there in my native life. I can do as much as I can, but I'm always German, too, you know, and I'm always a mother. That's my first identity, but I'm always a writer, too.","I have to write. I have to be an artist."],"Louise Fletcher":["She and my uncle were very sociable and would have a lot of people over at night to play cards or whatever. The high spot of those evenings was when we kids got dressed up to do a skit or something to amuse the guests. I loved it.","Life had stopped for her a long time ago. She was so out of touch with her feelings that she had no joy in her life and no concept of the fact that she could be wrong. She delivered her care of her insane patients in a killing manner, but she was convinced she was right.","If I fell down and hurt myself, I never cried. There was no one to hear me.","That's the main reason I gave up my career after John was born and I was pregnant with Andrew. I could not handle going away day after day. The thought of going away before they got up and coming back after they were in bed was intolerable.","I want to thank my mother and my father for teaching me to have a dream. You are seeing my dream come true.","I really would rather have gone to New York, since all my training had been in theater, but I didn't have the guts to go there alone. I knew only one person in New York, and that was a man. What I needed was a woman. That's the way Southern girls thought.","Live television drama was like live theater, because you moved without thinking about the camera. It followed you around. In film you have to be more aware of what the camera is doing.","From the time I was very young, maybe five or six, I thought a lot about being an actress. I didn't tell my friends about my ambitions, though, especially when I got older, because I thought they would not receive them well. I never talked about what I wanted to do."],"Louise Fresco":["Food, in the end, in our own tradition, is something holy. It's not about nutrients and calories. It's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity.","Food is as important as energy, as security, as the environment. Everything is linked together.","Rising demand for animal products highlights microbiological risks, with animal-welfare measures sometimes creating new hazards. For example, open pens for poultry may increase the spread of communicable diseases like avian influenza.","Our food is safer and our diets are more diverse than ever before; production methods are becoming increasingly sustainable, clean and efficient; and we are constantly becoming better at protecting biodiversity."],"Louise Gluck":["Toward his critics, the artist harbors a defensive ace: knowledge that the future will erase the present.","I have no concern with widening audience.","What I responded to, on the page, was the way a poem could liberate, by means of a word's setting, through subtleties of timing, of pacing, that word's full and surprising range of meaning. It seemed to me that simple language best suited this enterprise.","I preferred the simplest vocabulary.","I don't live with earplugs. I don't like the spotlight - but I like overhearing conversations.","We have a disturbing cultural appetite for novelty, and it seems to me wrong each new laureate should dislodge the ideas of his or her predecessor, especially when they're still unfolding.","It seems to me in the past it's been a good thing, as a writer, to have experiences I hadn't expected."],"Louise Hart":["Self-esteem is as important to our well-being as legs are to a table. It is essential for physical and mental health and for happiness.","The Golden Rule of Parenting is; do unto your children as you wish your parents had done unto you!","If you tell children they are bad, that's what they believe they are and that's probably what they will become."],"Louise J. Kaplan":["Adolescence is the conjugator of childhood and adulthood.","Adolescence represents an inner emotional upheaval, a struggle between the eternal human wish to cling to the past and the equally powerful wish to get on with the future.","The toddler must say no in order to find out who she is. The adolescent says no to assert who she is not.","Children, even infants, are capable of sympathy. But only after adolescence are we capable of compassion."],"Louise Jameson":["It's a comedy thriller, brilliantly written and it's full of twists and turns at every page. When I was reading it I was desperate to get to the end to find out what happens, it really hooks you.","I only have three scenes and each is a turn and she gets progressively drunker. It's all terribly funny and its main challenge is that it's so far away from what I usually do.","I think it's one of my favourite theatres ever, so quirky and wonderful and steeped in history. The space is wonderful and the acoustics are brilliant.","It was all to do with the change of producer as well as political reasons I don't really comprehend.","We were the victims of the new producer but what annoyed me was they told the press we were leaving before us.","I found that a bit unfair. However, I did feel quite liberated when I left. I'm very grateful to the show - it revived a flagging career, but I'm glad to be away from it now.","They can certainly expect to be very impressed with the technical aspects of the show, fooled and led up the garden path by the story and ultimately have a jolly good laugh!","I think I was first choice for the part. I don't know - that's what they always tell you anyway. I didn't have to do any audition for the part. Sam saw me in Dinner and the whole thing slipped into place.","I've been on the road for four years. I won't recognise the place again, until I walk out on stage.","It definitely puts a strain on family life - I miss them like mad. Being a working mother I've been juggling house and career from day one. I want to hold out for telly for the second half of the year.","I'm hopefully touring with Colin Baker next year in Perfect Strangers. I have performed with Sylvia Simms in poetry and music evenings. I would love to do those for the rest of my career - they are so fun and witty.","Tom is the most eccentric person I have ever worked with. We get on very well and I am most impressed with how he can hold an audience in the palm of his hand.","He was incredibly good as Dr Who. He brought all his eccentricities to the role and was so charismatic and charming. He must be the fans firm favourite.","I would love to go back as Leela in this new series.","They handled it very badly. It was disappointing and very humiliating. John York was very rude. He never consulted with me over what he said to the press.","I'm quite grateful to the BBC. They helped me back onto the touring circuit.","I never watch TV. I'm a Radio Four addict. I love listening to music too.","They must have a feeling of do or die. It is such an overcrowded profession.","I cannot understate the ability to handle classical texts such as Shakespeare."],"Louise L. Hay":["No person, no place, and no thing has any power over us, for 'we' are the only thinkers in our mind. When we create peace and harmony and balance in our minds, we will find it in our lives.","Remember, in the vast infinity of life, all is perfect, whole, and complete... and so are you.","I believe we create our own lives. And we create it by our thinking, feeling patterns in our belief system. I think we're all born with this huge canvas in front of us and the paintbrushes and the paint, and we choose what to put on this canvas.","Each one of us decides to incarnate upon this planet at a particular point in time and space. We have chosen to come here to learn a particular lesson that will advance us upon our spiritual, evolutionary pathway.","As my mind can conceive of more good, the barriers and blocks dissolve. My life becomes full of little miracles popping up out of the blue.","We learn our belief systems as very little children, and then we move through life creating experiences to match our beliefs. Look back in your own life and notice how often you have gone through the same experience.","Every thought we think is creating our future.","'Men don't cry!' 'Women can't handle money!' What limiting ideas to live with.","The point of power is always in the present moment.","Forgiveness is for yourself because it frees you. It lets you out of that prison you put yourself in.","Love is the great miracle cure. Loving ourselves works miracles in our lives.","If your mother did not know how to love herself, or your father did not know how to love himself, then it would be impossible for them to teach you to love yourself. They were doing the best they could with what they had been taught as children.","The gateways to wisdom and learning are always open, and more and more I am choosing to walk through them. Barriers, blocks, obstacles, and problems are personal teachers giving me the opportunity to move out of the past and into the Totality of Possibilities.","You should breathe deeply and chant, 'Money will easily and effortlessly flow into my life' as often as you can every day. Things will start to change after a month. If you believe you will be financially secure, then you are opening yourself up to change.","Learn from the past and let it go. Live in today.","We are each responsible for all of our experiences.","If we are willing to do the mental work, almost anything can be healed.","It seems to me that everyone on this planet whom I know or have worked with is suffering from self-hatred and guilt to one degree or another. The more self-hatred and guilt we have, the less our lives work. The less self-hatred and guilt we have, the better our lives work, on all levels.","I find that when we really love and accept and approve of ourselves exactly as we are, then everything in life works.","Know that you are always safe. And also know that it's possible to move from the old to the new, easily and peacefully.","If I want to believe that life is lonely and that nobody loves me, then that is what I will find in my world.","We choose our sex, our color, our country, and then we look around for the particular set of parents who will mirror the pattern we are bringing in to work on in this lifetime.","It is essential that we stop worrying about money and stop resenting our bills.","If you want to understand your parents more, get them to talk about their own childhood; and if you listen with compassion, you will learn where their fears and rigid patterns come from. Those people who 'did all that stuff to you' were just as frightened and scared as you are.","All the events you have experienced in your lifetime up to this moment have been created by your thoughts and beliefs you have held in the past. They were created by the thoughts and words you used yesterday, last week, last month, last year, 10, 20, 30, 40, or more years ago, depending on how old you are.","A carrier with a venereal disease can have many partners, but only those whose mental and physical immune systems are weak will be susceptible to it.","I wish the children could be taught early on that our thinking creates our experience."],"Louise Leakey":["I think when you work on fossils, and you realize that a species is there, and it's abundant for quite a long period of time, and then at some point it's no longer there - and so, when you look at that bigger picture, yes, you realize that either you change and adapt, or, as a species, you go extinct.","It's important to remember that we evolved. Now, I know that's a dirty word for some people, but we evolved from common ancestors with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos. We have a common past, and we have a common future.","In the rush of today's world, and with more than half of us now living in cities, the majority of people are less and less connected with the spectacle of nature.","If you want to become a fossil, you need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried. You then hope that the Earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface.","What is it that really makes us, us? It's our collective intelligence. It's our ability to write things down, our language and our consciousness.","When we find a fossil, we mark it. Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS. We mark it with a GPS fix, and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen, so we could essentially put it back on the surface, exactly where we found it.","If you want to become a fossil, you actually need to die somewhere where your bones will be rapidly buried. You then hope that the earth moves in such a way as to bring the bones back up to the surface. And then you hope that one of us lot will walk around and find small pieces of you.","With the discovery of Zinjanthropus at Olduvai Gorge in 1959, my grandmother Mary Leakey pioneered the research in East Africa with my grandfather Louis. Many more spectacular fossil finds have since been made, both in Africa and elsewhere, by many researchers driven to understand our past.","What the fossil record does do is to force us to contemplate our place on the planet. We are but one species of several hominids that inhabited Planet Earth, and like our distant cousins who went extinct fairly recently, our time on Planet Earth is also finite.","My father so appropriately put it that we are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species.","Every species becomes extinct; at some point, we will go extinct. The question is, as Homo sapiens, are we going to be able to adapt to the change that we're actually part of? We're causing such dramatic changes to the planet, so yes, you do stop and think, 'I wonder where we're headed.'"],"Louise Mensch":["We'd all survive if Twitter shut down for a short while during major riots. Social media isn't any more important than a train station, a road or a bus service. We don't worry about police temporarily closing those. Common sense. If riot info and fear is spreading by Facebook and Twitter, shut them off for an hour or two, then restore.","I like motivational books, because I like the go-getting American spirit - your destiny is in your own hands, life is what you make it, don't accept your limitations, jump before you're pushed, leap before you look.","Your moral stance depends on what you think is being aborted. If you don't believe it to be a person but part of a woman's body, of course you will be pro-choice. I would be virulently pro-choice if I didn't believe it to be a person.","Whether it has been supporting Corby's new free school, or fighting for the truth on the Cube overspend and land development deals, or striving to protect the East Northamptonshire countryside, in my work as the local MP I have always been struck, as I said in my maiden speech, by the pride people have in our area.","'Kane and Abel' is the best popular fiction of all time. As a kid, I wanted to be prime minister when I read 'First Among Equals.'","I want to retire very early, by the time I am 40, and go to live in Italy.","Money gives you the power to do whatever you want to do. I like the idea of being in complete control of my life.","What I enjoy doing is challenging stereotypes of what people believe a Tory must be. You don't have to say every Tory is in it for themselves - it's pathetic caricaturing that has no place in the 21st century, and if we can challenge that stereotype, then great.","I fundamentally believe that politics is counterintuitive. The left think they're helping working people by providing more rights, but all that actually happens is you create poverty and despair, because jobs go to your competitors who have fewer rights for workers.","I stood for parliament with the amazing support and help of my ex-husband, but it's not something that was handed to me like a peerage. I worked hard and was elected. So my achievements, such as they are, are my own.","Are you trivialising the sisterhood if you dye your hair or have your eyebrows threaded? I'd say the answer to that is no. But equally, it's a perfectly valid feminist thing to say there is a certain amount of attention on a woman's appearance, and I don't wish that to be the focus or a distraction.","Once you are a proper, serious law-maker, you can't break the laws you're writing.","In my view, the future of politics is, without a doubt, social liberalism married to economic conservatism. Which means we have to make an economic argument to social liberals, that it's OK to vote for us. But we won't run the economy into the ground at the same time.","Menshn is a play on the word mention, and in the U.S. that's how it'll be perceived. Like Tumblr or Flickr. People in the U.K. thought that I'd named it after myself.","The nature of the internet is that you don't know who is behind the screen.","I like my men to be manly, as you'll see from my books.","I'm not embarrassed about the novels I wrote when I was younger, but I couldn't write them today because of my religion.","Of course women can have it all - if they want it all. I won't hear any defeatist talk. If you just dwell on problems, you won't get anywhere fast.","That said, I can't emphasise enough - and I hope you print this - that I absolutely don't judge anybody at all who has an abortion, nor do I think they are murderers, nor do I think they are baby killers.","I have no ambitions to be a cabinet minister, or prime minister. I wouldn't wish being prime minister on my worst enemy.","I'm not sure I make old bones in parliament. It's an amazing experience to have had but I can't see myself being Mother of the House."],"Louise Nurding":["I'm not somebody who likes to show off my cleavage, and I don't dress up for the papers.","Your soulmate doesn't just mean your husband or your boyfriend. I have friends in my life who I believe I was meant to meet and be a part of.","As much as we love being sociable on holiday, part of me craves the idea of being away, staying in a hut on the beach, and maybe not seeing anyone for days apart from Jamie and the boys.","I know people who've had a nose job, and they've walked out feeling a million dollars, and their confidence is tenfold. Good on them! Natural beauty comes in all different shapes and sizes, but if you think surgery would right something you have a problem with, then why shouldn't you do it?","New Zealand was one of the most beautiful countries to drive through for the scenery and the vast scale of the place.","The thought of a spa treatment is lovely, but I'd be lying there having a massage and worrying about how much I had to do. I'm not very good at relaxing!","Our life may look glamorous, but we scream at the kids, and I have to tell Jamie to tidy up if we have guests coming over.","By the way, you won't put that thing in about me wanting to have sex on a football pitch, will you?","When I'm up on stage, I don't think about anything except the song I'm singing. Anyway, the majority of my audience is female, and I can't think that many of them want to see me a French maid outfit somehow!","I'm a big fan of Tony Blair. I'm not saying that I think his judgment has always been right, but I look at him as a person.","I suppose I try to dress for women like me, women I would look at and think, 'Ah, she looks cool, she looks nice'. You kind of get to an age when you know what suits you.","I would be upset if I was on the 'worst dressed'. It would make me think, 'Surely I haven't done anything that horrific - have I?'","I love Stella McCartney because she's timeless and classic, and I love Isabel Marant for wearability - you don't need 'an occasion' for her clothes.","I don't get involved in football! I haven't got a sporty bone in my body.","Age is just a number, and I know so many women who look fabulous at 40, 50 and 60 so it doesn't scare me. It's inevitable - I will get older, and the wrinkles will come, but I'm not that bothered.","I don't feel body confident at all! Anything but, actually.","What works for me is a little bit of training and sensible eating. You know, the Cameron Diaz's of the world put a lot of effort into it! But you can't have it all - I like going out for dinner with my husband; I like meeting my mates at Starbucks!","I don't believe in lots of face creams; I think your skin should work for itself. Your natural oils look after your skin, so I just use a simple face wash.","All my friends are girls. I just prefer the company of women.","I hate sport. I like girlie things.","The footballers' wives I know, they're teachers, midwives. They want to do something useful. One is working at my son's nursery, on her hands and knees, in Converse and jeans, teaching kids to count.","I own some Victoria Beckham dresses; they make me feel great.","After having your first child, it's a massive shock to the system. I work in an industry where people judge you and the way you look, and you always want to put your best foot forward when you can.","If you feel uncomfortable about something, just because you're in the public eye, it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt when people say things.","I realised that a lot of women felt the same way I did - they didn't want to wear heavy make-up, but, for whatever reason, there were elements in their skin they want to smooth out or cover.","I like to work; I like to be creative. I work in the entertainment industry where work may come up, and it may not, so I wanted to do something proactive. I've got a brain; I don't want to just sit at home - I want to do as much as I can.","There are hundreds and hundreds of women who are married to footballers, and we get to see a very small handful of them. They are all different individuals, and they choose the way they want to live their life or look, and I don't think it is really fair on anyone else to judge.","I think we make a common mistake of all wanting to look younger, and I think there is nothing more attractive, charming and endearing than when you meet a woman and you think she looks amazing for her age rather than 20 years younger because of this, that and everything else.","I think there is something lovely when a woman looks well.","I have quite dark skin, and when I had my son, I suffered quite bad pigmentation; I had dark patches on my face. Everyone said it would go, but it would take a very long time for them to even slightly disappear.","I can play the piano. I started off with lessons, and then, as we always had a piano in the house, I would play around and became quite good.","I grew up in a few houses because my dad was a builder, so we used to build and sell quite a lot.","I wish I was told to look after my teeth when I was younger. My smile is really important to me and one of my biggest assets, so I'm very conscious that I need to keep it in top condition.","I'm embarrassed to admit that I'm still scared of the dark. I have to have a light on all night. It's completely irrational, and my son is the same. I just hate the dark.","It's inevitable: as I get older, I am going to get more wrinkles; it's something you have to accept.","The gold iridescent 'Naked' outfit is perhaps not my finest moment.","I love Pilates - I am a really big believer in it as a practise; I think it's fab.","I live my life as healthy and consciously as I can.","There are very few people I would trust to look after my children.","I guess the most important thing for us is that the kids work hard and they are grateful for the life they lead - that they know it doesn't come easy.","I'll teach my kids right from wrong, but I'm never going to teach them that they can't have fun. They'll make mistakes; they'll do things they regret, like we all have.","One thing I wish I'd done differently in my career is insist on having friends or family on tour. I was really young when I travelled the world with Eternal, and I was always homesick.","For a performer, passion is far more important than technical skills. If a dancer's leg isn't at a perfect angle, I can see past that, but if someone's dead in the face, it's really boring.","I was on a beach in Hawaii for a video shoot once, and it was incredibly beautiful. It had very fine black sand with a silver sparkle running through it.","My son Beau got very ill when he was just four months old in Majorca. He contracted a really bad case of gastroenteritis. Everything feels so much worse when you don't speak the language, and you need that reassuring conversation as a mum, but you can't have it.","I'd love to do a safari holiday somewhere in Africa - maybe Kenya or Tanzania. I have never been, and we've deliberately waited until the children are older so that they could appreciate it, learn something and come back with stories.","I used to think you should keep on experimenting and seeing new things. But after seeing a lot of the world, I now tend to return to the same spots. I enjoy the familiarity.","I've always been a bad flyer, but I don't let it get in the way of travelling. I love stepping off the plane and feeling the heat and the foreign smell of being somewhere different.","I love Spanish cities, particularly Barcelona, Madrid and Palma, which has the most amazing cathedral that I once went to for a wedding.","Being in the pop group Eternal gave me the most wonderful opportunity to travel the world, and I have visited some spectacular countries.","I absolutely love reading; it is a fantastic way of unwinding.","Growing up, I was never the kind of girl to dream about wedding dresses and pretty houses.","People ask me whether I'd like another child, and it is difficult to answer, as I am so happy with the two I have.","I think wearing less makeup can seem a bit scary for some women because we get so used to seeing ourselves look a certain way.","The problem with being in the public eye for a long time is there are 20 years worth of looks to come back and haunt you!","I really believe less is more. When you get older, too much makeup can be ageing, and when you're young, you should enjoy the fact your skin is free from lines and wrinkles rather than overloading it with products.","I have a good shopping relationship with my mum. She lets me buy, and she spectates. I take advice from her, and I give it, too.","The thing about dads is, even when they're very good, they don't do anything like as much as most mums do.","My business partner and make-up artist Kim Jacob and I have employed every member of staff, decided where every desk in the office should go, tried every product on our faces.","I love fashion, but I do it in a really laid-back way. I'd much rather be underdressed than overdressed.","There's nothing worse than looking as if you've tried too hard or preened to within an inch of your life. If I'm wearing a strong item like a really beautiful dress, then I'll play down my shoes and accessories and make my hair really natural.","I've always loved Helena Christensen's style because she looks casual and comfortable, while being chic and cool.","My wardrobe staple is simple shirt dresses. They never date, and you can put them with a heel or a flat sandal."],"Louise Penny":["Every decade of my life I attempted to write a novel. But I had nothing to say. I was far too self-absorbed, and now I realize I was writing for others, so that they'd applaud me, see my genius, tell me how wonderful I am, or be jealous of my success.","Winning doesn't mean my book is better than anyone else's. It means I'm very fortunate. And I should be very, very aware of that. And grateful.","A good novel is a good novel, pointe finale. And I think what I'm writing is exactly that.","I've seen enough successful writers who no longer seem to care when they are recognized with an award, and I think that's just tragic.","I had to learn compassion. Had to learn what it felt like to hate, and to forgive and to love and be loved. And to lose people close to me. Had to feel deep loneliness and sorrow. And then I could write.","To be honest, the only thing I ever really wanted to be was a writer - since I read 'Charlotte's Web' as a child.","A good journalist, as you know, is a great listener. And so's a good writer. And I got to listen to people for almost 20 years. That serves me well, I hope, when I try to understand how a character might be feeling, or how they might react.","A journalist also needs to be disciplined, and so do I. I am, essentially, lazy. Without discipline I'd be just a mass of gummy bears on the sofa instead of on book tour with my eighth novel.","I turned down all the requests for the rights to the books, for years, mostly because they wanted the rights to the characters, and to turn it into a TV series. This would have allowed them to do anything they wanted with the characters, and that just wasn't an option for me."],"Louise Post":["I don't have anyone curbing my instincts, doing anything destructive to my self opinion.","I actually had the pleasure of meeting David Bowie at his 50th birthday party in New York City. I handed him the cassette of 'Eight Arms to Hold You,' which I had just got an advance of that day. He very graciously thanked me and tucked it into his jacket pocket.","I saw Styx in sixth grade. I loved Tommy Shaw. I got sneakers like him - he wore these tan Nikes.","My big brother listened to classic rock, and I grew up listening to a classic rock station called KSHE."],"Louise Rennison":["I like the idea that I can talk to any teenage girls. You know, in a language that makes sense to them.","I think 'growing up' would mean that you are incredibly tolerant and easygoing, liked everything, curious about the world because you weren't so egotistically driven.","I'm a real Luddite."],"Louise Slaughter":["Honesty, integrity, and accountability, the values, which should be the hallmark of this government, have instead been thrown under the bus by an arrogant majority, casualties in a misguided campaign to shield from accountability those who abuse this House.","Our girls have learned that sweat is sexy, brawn is beautiful and a little dirt never hurt anyone.","The U.S. has the finest research scientists in the world, but we are falling far behind other countries, like South Korea and Singapore, that are moving forward with embryonic stem cell research.","If they are opposed to abortion, they should be for preventing unintended pregnancies.","This House cannot function without an open, accountable, and independent ethics process; and the molestation of that process by the majority is an abuse of power that cannot stand.","And whether it is equal pay, health care, Social Security, or family leave, this Congress has refused to address issues critical to hard-working American women.","Let's clean up our environment. Let's clean up our bodies, but most importantly, let's not permit our babies of the future to be polluted before they are even born.","Many poor and low-income women cannot afford to purchase contraceptive services and supplies on their own.","We have record high temperatures and record high energy prices across the country, and we've seen the dangerous effects caused by extreme temperatures in the past.","If ever we had proof that our nation's pollution laws aren't working, it's reading the list of industrial chemicals in the bodies of babies who have not yet lived outside the womb.","For most women, including women who want to have children, contraception is not an option; it is a basic health care necessity.","As a microbiologist, I am particularly concerned with Mr. Bush's blatant disregard for science.","Contraceptives have a proven track record of enhancing the health of women and children, preventing unintended pregnancy, and reducing the need for abortion.","That we have children coming into this world already polluted, at the same time we don't know what the effects of that pollution will be on their mental and physical development, is both bad policy and immorally wrong.","Through persistent dedication, Susan B. Anthony, and other remarkable leaders, women were finally granted the right to vote in 1920.","We have a responsibility to promote stem cell research which could lead to treatments and cures for diseases affecting millions of Americans.","Challenge America grants go to the towns and hamlets of this sprawling country, where big touring companies will rarely go, and major actors, actresses, writers and artists may never appear in person.","Credit card companies pay college students generously to stand outside dining halls, dorms, and academic buildings and encourage their fellow students to apply for credit cards.","Half of all women who are sexually active, but do not want to get pregnant, need publicly funded services to help them access public health programs like Medicaid and Title X, the national family planning program.","I am disturbed that the identification and clothing of our public officials is so easily reproduced.","In these difficult financial times for so many of our districts, as our local leaders strive to balance their budgets by cutting services, we would be irresponsible not to invest in the arts.","Rove and his attorneys can parse the words all they want, but it is now clear that while Rove may not have given a reporter Plame's name, he clearly identified her by telling the reporter that Joseph Wilson's wife was a CIA agent.","Susan B. Anthony formed the Equal Rights Association, refuted ideas that women were inferior to men, and fought for a woman's right to vote.","We all know that girls who compete in sports perform better in school, are physically healthier and have a stronger self-esteem.","While other industries have suffered, the nonprofit arts world continues to build in strength while it encourages the growth of innumerable small businesses on its periphery, thereby creating more jobs.","Women in the service put themselves in harms way to protect us and our Nation from threats at home and abroad. The least we can do is ensure they are protected when facing a horrible tragedy."],"Louise Wilson":["Without art, you don't have society. It underpins so much.","A lot of fashion might seem boring, but it is actually quite fun: the inside, the outside, the silhouette... All the different finishes. That's a skill.","In fashion, you're privileged because you're consistently working with a vanguard of youth.","As much as I might decry the students, as much as they're a nightmare, it's a privilege to be among youth.","I always say to students, 'You're never going to have all the skills, but you have to have a skill.'","I think the problem is that fashion has become too fashionable.","What is good work? You just know it when you see it. You just can't explain it.","There's a broad range of fashion: knitwear, textiles, journalism.","The only thing with press attention is that it can be very draining on our energy store.","We always want more, more, more. You see good work; you want it better. We push, push, push.","I'm becoming the Simon Cowell of fashion.","Youth re-energises.","Fashion's transient - it moves.","I always thought I was going to be a professional horse rider because I rode horses competitively from zero to 17 years old.","I was very successful at three-day events, point-to-points, Pony Club, and gymkhana. But then I went to college, and because I had really good horses, they weren't going to be left in the field, so they were sold.","I have very tidy cupboards. I do like a cupboard to look nice when you open it, with the labels facing forward.","I have no unhappy memories of my childhood.","I'd love to be charming and softly spoken, but that's never going to happen.","I was going to do business studies in Newcastle because there were a lot of nightclubs. My father said if I went that route, he'd never speak to me again: credit where credit's due.","I never really liked Italy. 'Lots of cement' is my long-standing quote.","Everything is not on a plate for you at Saint Martins - it's about personality, about working out how to do it.","At the end of the day, I'm a very boring academic, bogged down with academia and structure and delivering an education.","I've always loved books.","I've always spent money on books. I've always enjoyed handling books - the size, the format. I feel very strongly about original ephemera.","In the past, you'd have one magazine, it would arrive monthly, and that was your magazine. You'd devour it; you'd absorb all the knowledge in it; you'd read it over and over again.","Now there is tons of information available online. 90% of students rarely look at magazines in their intended format because they're looking at them on a computer screen. They don't understand the layout, so when they come to putting their own portfolios together, they have no spatial awareness.","I've always believed that you have to have the skills before you destroy the skills. If you want to be crude, be crude, but don't be crude because you don't know how to do it, because you're not perfect at drawing and pattern-cutting.","I believe intellect is needed in order to develop any creative output and that intellect alone is not enough!","Elegance for one society is not elegance for another. It's in the eyes of the beholder.","I try to stop my students doing random things on the Internet or putting work online. It doesn't get them jobs. This concept of being noticed, I don't know what it brings you.","My students are noticed by the people I respect from the quality of their work.","I wear black because I'm a large lady, and I have many exact replicas of the same black outfit.","There's lots of bad things about teaching, but the really good thing is that you get to be around young people - irritating as they are.","The press always pick on British fashion, but I don't think that there are more successful young designers than in Paris or Milan. It's all a myth.","I was born in Cambridgeshire and moved to Scotland when I was seven.","We had six horses, and I would compete. Jumping. Cabinets full of cups. I always won.","I love to-do lists.","In 'Who's Who,' my hobbies are listed as eating, sleeping, and voicing one's opinion. Not necessarily the right opinion, but it's mine.","People think I'm rude. I'm not rude; I'm just not networking. It's just honesty.","Show-offy, I could sometimes be accused of.","I can't imagine taking up running.","Most designers don't dress in fashion. They dress in an anonymous way so that people are just judging their work.","I still believe that education is about provoking some kind of original, creative thought.","I never know what I want, but always know what I don't want.","I don't see why you wouldn't cry when you're in an intense environment.","I love hard work, energy, feeling involved.","When you're responsible for leading a group of young people, you have to be positive. If you're not, you shouldn't be in your job, should you?","I love Ikea: it's non-design, but it works.","You can't refuse to move forward when you're educating in design, because that's what we're asking students to do the whole time.","I had a fabulous childhood. Not many people have an outdoor tennis court that you're allowed to put your ponies on and pretend you're at Hickstead.","I always hate it when fashion is trivialised.","Fashion is an incredibly tough, unforgiving industry.","I may sound like a corny bastard, but I love fashion.","I'd rather wear black than bright florals like most fat ladies do."],"Louise Woodward":["I knew I was coming home, I thought they would consider acquittal, I was disappointed that they didn't.","The support in Britain made a big difference.","I don't think I can answer questions about the trust fund.","I would like to go to University and be like a normal 20 year old.","In time the truth will come out, I will be cleared.","I said all along I would not sell my story. I don't think it would be right."],"Lourdes Leon Ciccone":["I have a lot of people judging my every move. It's important for me to not let it rule my life.","My mom has helped me so much. She has great style, and she's an amazing dresser.","Being in the wardrobe department meant me and a few other girls dressed the dancers during the show when they had quick changes. Thirty seconds to totally dress a sweaty dancer can be insane and provoke mucho anxiety. Doing this night after night was pretty cray, but I loved every minute of it.","I love when someone doesn't pretend to be someone they are not.","My mom definitely inspires me. She's just crazy when it comes to her fashion sense.","My mom doesn't fit into my shoes, so sucks for her!","I used to look at the outfits that I wore when I was 11, and I was like, 'That's really ugly.' I mean, I just thought I was the coolest kid ever and actually wasn't.","Yay, me - I made it out of high school alive and well!","I wouldn't go blonde. I'd like to do a darker color - a really dark, dark red.","As you probably know, this woman I like to call my mother went on tour for her 'MDNA' album. As a summer job, I decided to work in the wardrobe department. All of my friends were getting summer jobs, and I wanted one, too. Mine was a little unconventional but still a great experience and a lot of fun.","It's really a great experience to be able to work on a large production, traveling around like a family, setting up for an amazing show, and all having the same purpose."],"Lowell Bergman":["You can have all the information you want in the world. If you don't have the people raising questions and looking beneath the surface, and people being paid to do this, you're not going to find the answers.","The fact that wealthy people or people from privileged backgrounds may wind up in a violent terrorist organization is not new.","Terrorism gets people's attention.","When you have an attorney giving you advice, it would be nice to know what their financial relationship is to the advice.","What has been adjudicated and established in the wake of Vietnam and the Civil Rights movement is the ability of the press to basically write or broadcast almost anything about the government. There's very few restrictions in that way.","You can't expect that because you find a story and report it out that your newspaper and broadcasting company is going to want to publish and broadcast it - and you're going to be a hero.","I tell my students that if you have enough preparation, you can handle the big interviews. You won't be intimidated.","My role, or anyone's role in network news, is to make the person on camera look good. You don't do that, you don't work there.","There has always been tension between reporters and the administration, particularly when it comes to war in the modern era. You can go to Kennedy or Johnson and see that they weren't happy with David Halberstam or Morley Safer.","I have quite a bit of experience reporting on corporate behavior, both doing it with independent operations in early in my career, in the underground press, to magazines like 'Rolling Stone,' to regional newspapers and television, and television news programs, to papers like the 'New York Times' and public television.","Ever since Woodward and Bernstein, there's sort of been an epidemic of confidential sources in Washington, in particular where people will actually - when you call them up on the phone, they'll say, 'This is off the record,' or, 'This is on background,' or they don't even wait for you to say anything.","You know, when people talk about filmmaking and the techniques of filmmaking, we use them all the time in network television news in order to make our stories simpler, tighter and more understandable to the general public."],"Lowell McAdam":["We're always skating to wherever the puck is going.","Cloud computing is the third wave of the digital revolution.","We looked at the customer segment that we want to go after, the Millennials, which everybody wants to go after. They are not buying linear TV.","As I look forward in things like the Internet of Things, I am sure we will talk about video. There is a lot of disruption going on and a lot of new products being brought to market, products like Go90.","Latency is very important when you think about autonomous cars and things like that - 5G will really change the game, and I think will be another spike of growth in the wireless industry.","At Verizon, we've been strategically investing in emerging technology, including Verizon Digital Media Services and OTT, that taps into the market shift to digital content and advertising. AOL's advertising model aligns with this approach, and the advertising platform provides a key tool for us to develop future revenue streams.","You're starting to see programs literally completely supported - all the data usage supported by a company. So our friends at AwesomenessTV are doing a series set on a cruise ship called 'Royal Crush' completely subsidized by Royal Caribbean cruises because they're trying to have teens see that cruises can be cool.","The key for us is to have assets that are easy for people to get to and they want to use. So Go90 right out of the gate will have certain things that are exclusive to Verizon, but you can download it if you're a Sprint customer or T-Mobile customer, and they're doing that. Things like the AwesomenessTV - exclusive content.","If you look at the first generation of wireless, it really lasted about 15 years before we went to the second generation. When we implemented the fourth generation, which allowed us to do all the smartphones and the videos, the time between that and going to the fifth generation is going to be four years.","No one wants to have 300 channels on your wireless device.","It's only natural that the heavy users help contribute to the investment to keep the Web healthy. That is the most important concept of net neutrality.","Verizon's vision is to provide customers with a premium digital experience based on a global multiscreen network platform.","The OnCue platform and team will help Verizon bring next-generation video services to audiences who increasingly expect to view content when, where, and how they want it. Verizon already has extensive video content relationships, fixed and wireless delivery networks, and customer relationships in both the home and on mobile.","We're extremely excited about the assets that Yahoo has in the areas of Sports and Finance and Email and News. You match those up with AOL, and we've just made an exponential leap in capabilities here."],"Lowell Thomas":["Do a little more each day than you think you possibly can.","After the age of 80, everything reminds you of something else.","Separately there was only wind, water, sail, and hull, but at my hand the four had been given purpose and direction.","The ability to speak is a short cut to distinction. It puts a man in the limelight, raises him head and shoulders above the crowd.","The man who can speak acceptably is usually given credit for an ability out of all proportion to what he really possesses."],"Lu Guanqiu":["A country that cannot support entrepreneurship has no hope.","I'll put every cent that Wanxiang earns into making electric vehicles. I'll burn as much cash as it takes to succeed, or until Wanxiang goes bust.","The road is still very long. We want to concentrate for now on manufacturing in the U.S. If I don't succeed, my son will continue with it. If he doesn't make it, my grandson will.","As long as Wanxiang exists, we will pursue our dream to make electric cars, whatever the obstacles.","I want to use whatever resources in the world we can use, unite whatever force we can unite, ally with whichever partner we can find.","We will cooperate with whoever is best... as long as they choose us as well. It cannot be merely unrequited love.","Wanxiang and Ener1 share a vision to help fulfill our country's strong commitment to electrifying transportation on a mass scale and to deploy lithium-ion technology to improve the effectiveness of the power grid.","People in the U.S. welcome us. We're solving their employment problems.","Of course we want to pocket Fisker. But we will bid rationally. Whatever the result, nothing can stop us from making electric cars.","Our biggest competitor is ourselves.","I want my people to work hard. But if they see me earning a lot more than they do, they would lose their sense of being owners of the factory, and what I say as factory manager wouldn't stick.","As I see it, if the production of a factory is expanding, and workers are satisfied, it's OK for there to be a disparity. The best paid should be about three times more than the worst paid.","It's not that things won't change - they can't help but change. Things are becoming more and more competitive.","North Korea is like China was 30-plus years ago. Through our contact, we are certain they will become more open and more liberated."],"Lu Wei":["Positive energy knows no boundaries. If everyone were to spread positive energy on the Internet, the world would be a much better place.","Positive energy is meant to give people confidence and hope, encourage people to love their country, society and life, as well as to pursue nice things. Everything we do is ultimately for the sake of spreading positive energy.","The Internet is a worldwide platform for sharing information. It is a community of common interests. No country is immune to such global challenges as cybercrime, hacking, and invasion of privacy.","The Internet is a free and open platform. Everyone has the right to speak. However, compliance with the law is the bottom line that no one should violate.","It is a misuse of words if you say 'content censorship'. But no censorship does not mean there is no management.","In cyberspace, people with different skin colors, nationalities, cultures and languages should be equally entitled to participation, free speech and development. We should abandon prejudices, respect differences, and be tolerant and open.","China has always been very hospitable, but we can choose who enters our house. We could not allow any companies to enter China and make money while hurting the country.","I didn't say Facebook could not enter China, but nor did I say that it could.","The Chinese government learnt how to manage the Internet from Western developed countries; we have not learnt enough yet.","In cyberspace, it is becoming increasingly difficult to uphold security for one's own country by sacrificing that of others."],"Lu Xun":["Hope cannot be said to exist, nor can it be said not to exist. It is just like roads across the earth. For actually the earth had no roads to begin with, but when many men pass one way, a road is made.","To be suspicious is not a fault. To be suspicious all the time without coming to a conclusion is the defect."],"Lu Yu":["Its liquor is like the sweetest dew from Heaven.","Its goodness is a decision for the mouth to make."],"Luanne Rice":["Anyone with a heart, with a family, has experienced loss. No one escapes unscathed. Every story of separation is different, but I think we all understand that basic, wrenching emotion that comes from saying goodbye, not knowing if we'll see that person again - or perhaps knowing that we won't.","'Little Night' has layers of meaning. There's something enchanted about night. All those heavenly bodies, shooting stars, the crescent moon, celestial phenomenon. Owls fly at night, and first kisses happen. Night is romantic. Alternately, darkness hides the worst of human behavior.","One of my earliest memories is of seeing my mother in her beach chair, reading a book under an umbrella by the water's edge while my sisters and I played beside her. Of all the life lessons she taught me, that is one of my favorites: to take time at a place I love, restore my spirit with books and the beach.","'Safe Harbor' is a state of mind... it's the place - in reality or metaphor - to which one goes in times of trouble or worry. It can be a friendship, marriage, church, garden, beach, poem, prayer, or song.","My first three-sisters novel in a while, 'Sandcastles' tells the story of the Sullivan family - two passionate artists and their three wildly different daughters. There's also a renegade nun and a mystery man, but I don't want to give too much away!","During one new moon at perigee, I stood on high ground, watching salt ponds overflow, cover the beach, and meet the ocean. Because the moon was invisible, the water was black as it drowned the sand, and the event felt primal - which in fact it was, because it was nature.","Several of my favorite cousins and some of my best friends are lawyers, and I find the profession endlessly fascinating.","Here are a few of the actors who have brought my novels to TV life: Bill Pullman, Holly Hunter, Frances McDormand, Julian Sands, Gena Rowlands, Rob Lowe, Julia Ormond, Chelsea Hobbs, Tate Donovan, Anne Heche, Max Martini, Campbell Scott, Kimberly Paisley-Williams, Alexa Vega, and the late legends Richard Kiley and Kim Hunter.","Hallmark makes beautiful films that feel as if they should be watched in a theater. The Hall family knows the power of stories, and they give us unforgettable movies with heart and depth and the resonance of classics.","I went to Cork, Ireland, and stood on the dock some of my ancestors had left from. I felt their ghosts gather round me, and I cried to imagine what it must have felt like - leaving that beautiful land and those beloved people, knowing it was forever.","My mother painted and wrote. She always had a painting in progress on an easel in the kitchen, so our house always smelled like oil paint. At night, she wrote after she'd put my sisters and me to bed, and the sound of her typing was our lullaby.","While novels are fiction, mine are usually very close to my heart. Like my other books, 'The Lemon Orchard' is inspired by something I care about. I care so deeply. The stories are my dreams, and I want to do a lot of research. Roberto is based on a real live friend of mine named Armando who worked in my garden.","What it takes is to actually write: not to think about it, not to imagine it, not to talk about it, but to actually want to sit down and write. I'm lucky I learned that habit a really long time ago. I credit my mother with that. She was an English teacher, but she was a writer.","I am a close friend of Robert Loggia. And I just love how, with actors, there's the screen persona. Here is Robert, known for his portrayal of many characters, including gangsters. But in real life, he is elegant and erudite. He sits in the garden reading the sonnets of William Shakespeare.","I was married to a law student, and I used to attend classes with him at Georgetown University Law Center. Being of dramatic bent, I was drawn mainly to Criminal law and Evidence classes. A just-beginning writer, I would find an empty chair and listen, mesmerized, to the lectures.","I traveled to Ireland to research 'Sandcastles,' to visit the coastline where my ancestors looked toward America, the tiny town they once loved so much, and the docks from which they sailed toward their dreams of building a better life for their family. The answers I found on that journey are woven through the novel.","A lot of writers dream of feature films, but television - by way of TNT, CBS, Lifetime, and Hallmark Hall of Fame - has always called my name. And after seeing 'True Detective,' can there be any doubt that the storytelling on TV is as genius as it gets?","I am honored to have had two Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions made from my novels - 'Silver Bells' and 'Follow the Stars Home.'","When I was married to an abuser, he'd tell me he wouldn't have to get so angry if only I'd be less demanding, more supportive, more understanding. I hid the truth from everyone, especially myself.","After 30 novels, release day is still a thrill. It's always a little bittersweet, too.","'Little Night' comes from deep in my heart, and tells about the lengths people will go for love.","My father gave me an old Olympia portable when I was in fourth grade. Our ancestors came from Ireland. Our family stories of immigration helped me understand more about my characters in 'The Lemon Orchard.'","When my father died, I was 21, and he'd been sick for a few years. He changed during his illness. He kind of softened during it."],"Lubna Olayan":["I think that Saudi women are very powerful. And I think that Saudi men are the greatest support to Saudi women.","Saudi men have sisters, mothers, and wives, and in my working experience, I have had tremendous support from Saudi men. I really don't think that Saudi women are oppressed or abused.","I think that driving is the least important issue. We as women have a lot more things to tackle before we get to the issue of driving, such as the opportunity to work in any field we choose.","I never dwell on what I've personally achieved."],"Luc Besson":["It's always the small people who change things. It's never the politicians or the big guys. I mean, who pulled down the Berlin wall? It was all the people in the streets. The specialists didn't have a clue the day before.","I wanted to prove that I could do something, so I made a short film. That was in fact my main concern, to be able to show that I could do one.","I would rather stop too soon than too late.","I'm always attracted by people who are lost in their time. I think it helps us.","You know sometimes you're in a position of risk and you feel that you can turn good or bad.","I said if I made 10 films in my life, I would be very lucky. That's how I meant it. My fear after my first one was whether they would let me make another one, so I had this goal in my head.","After six, seven films, I started to get a little tired. Shooting takes a lot out of you.","I think we have the wrong notion of commercial and intellectual or artistic film. Because all films are commercial."],"Luc Dardenne":["Film-makers in Belgium are seen as arts and crafts makers. It is a small country. There is not really a film industry there at all.","Filming is like a house, you have to feel comfortable in it.","Filmmaking has always involved pairs: a director coupled with a producer, a director alongside an editor... The notion of couples is not foreign to cinema."],"Luc Ferrari":["Boulez seemed to me to be a guy who wrote laws. Like a company lawyer.","Electronic music used pure sounds, completely calibrated. You had to think digitally, as it were, in a way that allowed you to extend serial ideas into other parameters through technology.","I have problems with machines which aren't gestural.","I probably went to musique concrete concerts - though not the very first ones - at the beginning of the 50s.","I think I came across Cecil Taylor a bit later, in 65 or 66. That really impressed me - Cecil Taylor is an amazing character... Both his music and the way he approaches the instrument are astonishing.","I wanted to play piano, and that slid quickly into writing - it wasn't enough to play other people's notes: I had to write notes too.","I was born in Paris, and I haven't moved, except until now - I live in the suburbs and I hate it.","My sisters were going out with artists and poets, and eventually it was the creative world which attracted me.","So the ideology was that: use sounds as instruments, as sounds on tape, without the causality. It was no longer a clarinet or a spring or a piano, but a sound with a form, a development, a life of its own.","Well, first I studied piano. I wasn't very satisfied because I though my teachers were dumb... and repressive.","When the Domaine Musical started up, I wasn't part of it. They were the major players in contemporary music at that time, braodcasting old and new composers' work. And I wasn't one of them.","Whereas Schaeffer and Henry were working like samplers, their idea was to capture those sounds which couldn't be serially calibrated because they were too complex in character.","With the piano I'm completely in control of the gestural situation-not that I'm going to play the piece myself, but I know what's difficult, what's impossible.","You turned on the radio and heard all kinds of things."],"Luc Montagnier":["They don't actually see the real world, where 95% of the people with HIV are not treated and are dying. And even though we have some blue sky now in our country, the sky could become cloudy again very soon.","It's very difficult in our society. You cannot impose certain behavioral changes. Education can do it at the right time, probably by high school. After that it is too late.","It's clear that prevention will never be sufficient. That's why we need a vaccine that will be safe.","That is why it is so important not only to have excellent treatment but also to try to get back the immune defense, because there you have a natural defense that takes place everywhere.","We don't know why, but there are some gradients of infection.","Since most of the transmission is sexual transmission, you have a regional or local response to the virus.","What seems to be clear to me is that after the primary infection most of the cells die indirectly, but at the later stage, when the viral load is very high, the virus kills a lot of cells directly.","What perhaps should receive more attention is the effect of the treatment on the virus.","We are working with a biotech company, Calypte, which has designed a urine test for the HIV antibody.","The idea of the live-virus vaccine is to produce in a continuous way some viral antigens.","The center will be fully operational in two years' time, but probably in the middle of the year we will have a temporary laboratory of 4,000 square feet.","Psychological factors are critical in supporting immune function. If you suppress this psychological support by telling someone he's condemned to die, your words alone will have condemned him.","Our goal is not to completely eradicate the infection - that would be very difficult - but to produce a vaccine that will prevent not infection but disease. I think this is more possible.","One could not have isolated this retrovirus without knowledge of other retroviruses, that's obvious. But I believe we have answered the criteria of isolation.","My proposal now is to test a vaccine first on people who have been infected, and if you show some efficacy at this level, you might be able to go further to study uninfected people in a population with a high rate of infection.","It's easier to learn things for life by the age of 12 and not the age of 18. This is just my guess.","I've participated in meetings where there were concerns by ethical experts. There is no clear solution.","I think we should put the same weight now on the co-factors as we have on HIV.","I am very puzzled by the fact that young people are getting infected again. They don't take precautions despite an enormous amount of information. It's like riding a race car at 200 kilometers an hour. Some people like the risk.","Basic research is very useful, but it should be more geared toward application than it was before.","Another interesting field, which is my own, is cofactors, not only to the disease but also to transmission. I am still puzzled by the fact that you get more sexual transmission in some ethnic populations. One way to answer this is to look for genetic factors.","AIDS win be our first priority, but in two years' time we don't know where AIDS research will stand, so we are also thinking of activity on other diseases.","AIDS does not inevitably lead to death, especially if you suppress the co-factors that support the disease. It is very important to tell this to people who are infected."],"Luc de Clapiers":["The fruit derived from labor is the sweetest of pleasures.","The most absurd and reckless aspirations have sometimes led to extraordinary success.","The art of pleasing is the art of deception.","The maxims of men reveal their characters.","Our failings sometimes bind us to one another as closely as could virtue itself.","Great thoughts come from the heart.","Lazy people are always anxious to be doing something.","The greatest achievement of the human spirit is to live up to one's opportunities and make the most of one's resources.","All grand thoughts come from the heart.","Clarity is the counterbalance of profound thoughts.","Clearness ornaments profound thoughts.","Everyone is born sincere and die deceivers.","Those who can bear all can dare all.","Obscurity is the realm of error.","The things we know best are the things we haven't been taught.","You are not born for fame if you don't know the value of time.","To execute great things, one should live as though one would never die.","Indolence is the sleep of the mind.","Patience is the art of hoping.","The fool is like those people who think themselves rich with little.","The wicked are always surprised to find ability in the good.","The conscience of the dying belies their life.","When a thought is too weak to be expressed simply, it should be rejected.","It is difficult to esteem a man as highly as he would wish.","Prosperity makes few friends.","One can not be just if one is not humane.","Wicked people are always surprised to find ability in those that are good.","We should expect the best and the worst of mankind, as from the weather.","If people did not compliment one another there would be little society.","Emotions have taught mankind to reason.","To achieve great things we must live as though we were never going to die.","The idle always have a mind to do something.","Men sometimes feel injured by praise because it assigns a limit to their merit; few people are modest enough not to take offense that one appreciates them.","There is nothing that fear and hope does not permit men to do.","You must rouse into people's consciousness their own prudence and strength, if you want to raise their character.","The law cannot equalize mankind in spite of nature.","One promises much, to avoid giving little.","Vice stirs up war, virtue fights.","To possess taste, one must have some soul.","The greatest evil which fortune can inflict on men is to endow them with small talents and great ambition."],"Luca Cordero di Montezemolo":["I'm married to Ferrari.","We don't sell a car, we sell a dream. We are Italy's national team. There are many great soccer teams in our country, but there is only one Ferrari.","Let's make it clear: it's Ferrari I'm interested in. Drivers, we've had a lot, some very good, some great, but drivers come and go, while Ferrari remains.","I don't believe in the electric cars, but I strongly believe in hybrids.","We do not invest in advertising... So racing is the best advertising for Ferrari.","I don't like nouvelle cuisine, too small bits. I like to have a nice wine, nice pasta, tomatoes.","India is a very, very old country with a history, culture and tradition like Italy. And we can use the English language to be in touch. Then India's industrial situation is similar to us. Both have big companies but are dominated by small and medium-sized companies. It is extremely important for both to do joint ventures.","'LaFerrari' means 'the Ferrari.' The excellence. In this car, we put everything we are able to do. Our extreme technology, extreme experience, extreme capability. And this has been the first Ferrari totally designed in our design center.","With a brand - and I respect Porsche - but the Ferrari brand is more exclusive... We never do SUVs, we never do four doors, and we never exceed 7,000 cars per year. And 7,000 means 7,000.","I always say to my people, 'If you don't sell a Ferrari to a football player, you make a big present to me.' Really. Because they buy to just show off. I don't like.","Ferrari, together with my family, is the owner of my heart.","Nobody in Formula One has won so many titles, so many races as I did. So Ferrari for me is crucial; it is more than important.","I am a person that when I go in the street, everybody knows me and goes: 'Oh, you are entering politics.' I want to do something positive for the future. It doesn't mean to become a leader of a party.","I think China represents huge opportunities for Europe.","Sonia Gandhi and her husband have always been persons I look at with a lot of respect. Of course, one of the reasons we look at India with a lot of sympathy and enthusiasm is Sonia Gandhi. Now she is Indian, not Italian, but she will always represent a myth for Italians.","I speak for all Italian industry that India is number one priority for us.","I'm a full-of-contradictions kind of guy.","I like the world, but I feel very, very Italian. I love the small parts of my country: Tuscany, Capri in the winter. I don't like big towns.","A Fiat Panda, it's the best car in the world.","Formula 1 has to be more and more also a laboratory, a centre of advanced research for innovative technologies for tomorrow's cars. The KERS is very important in this context, and Ferrari as a manufacturer had, and has, extraordinary support in Formula 1.","Formula 1 will always have high and strong investment. Who can't make these investments will race in other series.","As far as Alfa is concerned, everything is possible; the brand is extremely sporty and connected to Ferrari since the early days of motorsports.","I want to have different Ferraris for different Ferraristi. We have a lot of parallel activities that can increase revenues without being obliged to produce more cars.","These new 'hybrid' F1 cars represent an extremely complex project.","We at Ferrari are a small, dynamic company, and we show what Italy can do.","Ferrari used to be the car that you kept in your garage, took out to polish and show, and put back into the garage.","Italy is famous for fashion, food, Ferrari, and furniture - furniture was a segment where the companies in the high end are all small."],"Luca Guadagnino":["As a director, what matters is how you penetrate the soul of the person in front of the camera and let the actor blur the boundaries between the character and the person themselves. In order to achieve that, I try to make people feel at ease, to be mindless of problems and be skinless and give everything to the camera.","The point is that filmmaking is a collaborative effort; it isn't about imposing your vision on other people. It's about the talking, you know?","I grew up with a concept of cinema as a directorial thing, meaning the director is allowed to sail the ship. Not a dictatorial thing.","If you desire something, you don't have it. It is more interesting than enjoyment, because enjoyment erases the mysteries and the vision of desire. Desire opens up possibilities but never achieves anything, whereas enjoyment is just the brutal achievement of something - and after that, it's done.","You know when they say you need to put people who go well together? I much prefer to put people who fight at the table. Then you have some sort of sparkle at the dinner!","I come from a petit bourgeois family, and I've always been drawn to artists and people who choose their own way of life instead of being chosen by the lives that people want for them.","I hate the concept of beauty for the sake of it. It is overrated.","I love to tell stories, but the making is less comfortable. I like to be private, and being in the middle of a film crew with the least amount of privacy is the discomfort of shooting a movie. For me, the editing is the great moment when I can bring back ideas and realize the movie for the last time before I hand it to the audience.","I'm interested in form, in the shape of things. And in commitment to the degree of never letting go the quest for the meaning of things. That can come off as beauty and style, but that's not where I start from.","Everything that goes outside the rules of Italian cinema has always been cursed.","In 1993, my first documentary was about the civil war in Algeria. That was in French and in Arabic. Another short film I did was silent. What I'm trying to say is that, yes, I'm Italian, and yes, I make films with Italian money, but personally, I've always been invested in the broader world of film-making.","I have a number of projects that I've been dreaming of making ever since I was a child. But I am also very open to the chances of life and the chances of my profession.","I think a script is great when it starts with the structure and works with the structure without falling into the typical three-act system in which the audience is ahead of the movie. I hate that, but that is like 99% of what I read.","I personally don't think that blood ties should be something that signifies so much more than anything else. I understand perfectly when somebody leaves their family for good.","I am a Hitchcockian - I still believe that 'Psycho' sets the standard for mother/son relations.","I don't like post-modernism. It's cynical, and takes no discipline - you just copy. It doesn't allow a film to be open to reality.","I'm one of those directors who read reviews, even if they're bad, because I started as a film critic as a cinema student. I indulge in the art of criticism in general.","I only cast the actors and actresses I fall in love with - truly having an emotion for them, an anticipation and enthusiasm when seeing them - and I believe that my emotional confidence in them blends into chemistry. It's always been like that, and I hope I won't be wrong in the future.","I'm a very eclectic person, and I enjoy multiple tastes; I'm like a bee who jumps from flower to flower. Before I die, I have to make a war movie, a Western, and a movie like Mike Nichols, because I love him.","Making movies is about control. You need to control your narcissism in the first place, and you need to be disciplined enough to understand the reason for the film. You need to follow the agenda of the film, not a personal agenda or that of the studio. Or, worst of all, of the actors.","My father is a teacher; my mother was a telecom employee. I come from Palermo; I was raised in Ethiopia. I am homosexual. I didn't go to film school.","I am more interested in revolutionary beauty than in the great beauty, to be honest. Italian cinema is now mostly a bureau for tourism. We have given up that revolution of the contemporary.","I don't much like post-modernism, because post-modernist has become the basket in which every mediocre person can shuffle things and pretend to do something significant, and we could also mention who use post-modernism in this way - maybe we shouldn't.","I think we shouldn't be shy of thinking that we can interpret text like a movie again, depending on the point of view and what we do with it more than anything else. Of course a lot of remakes of important films, particularly of horror films, they suck.","I am a film director, and I work with a visual language, with a visual medium. And I try to make virtue of the use of this visual medium. And I try to make sure what I do speaks the language of cinema.","When you have great performers and have set your movie in the right direction, it's a beautiful privilege to let the camera watch the action unfold without spoken words.","The concept of making a movie in which the director dictates is kind of exotic - and absolutely not truthful. Directing means allowing a great deal of collaboration and listening and having the ability to change your mind.","I think that making a movie is not just making the movie - it is also about having thoughtful ideas and embracing all the aspects of its launch.","My secret desire is to be an interior designer. I'd love to make houses for rich clients who can afford to do things right.","Spare functional furniture, in my opinion, is the genius of 20th-century design.","The concept of muse is alien to me. To speak of a muse implies there is a couple in which one person is the objectified passive element - there to help the creative, active, often male part of the duo to create. A muse is very passive. Who wants a muse? I don't want a muse.","Moviemaking is a dirty, tiring affair. The joy comes from the possibility to be free on set and really let loose.","I need to have a great deal of control and the ability to share my control with my collaborators and grant them the freedom and the quality of work I think these people deserve. If I don't have those elements, I walk away.","I'm incredibly inspired by the goofy edginess of teenagers and young people.","I think you should never be forced to be nice as an artist. An artist has to be uncomfortable in a way. Narcissistic and uncomfortable.","When people think fashion is just the surface of things, I disagree very politely."],"Luca Parmitano":["I grew up and I kind of took the road of becoming a pilot, which was another dream I had of flying, and once I did attend the air force academy, that dream of flying became more like a project, and I wanted to be a fighter pilot, which I did. I became a fighter pilot.","My memories of my childhood are wonderful memories. I feel that I was privileged because I grew up in a beautiful city. It is Catania, on the eastern coast of Sicily. It's a place filled with sun, close to the beach.","So one thing that I want to do is to make people realize that astronauts in general are very normal people. They are down to Earth, so to speak. I know it sounds contradictive, but we are very normal people. We are very normal people with a fantastic privilege and opportunity to do something that is extraordinary.","Is there any other job that beats being an astronaut? Who didn't want to be an astronaut? That is my question.","It is an incredible treat and certainly one of the highlights of any astronaut's career to do a spacewalk.","Being Italian, I have a very special relationship with the culinary arts. One my projects was to share Italian cultural food with my colleagues."],"Lucan":["There stands the shadow of a glorious name.","Some men by ancestry are only the shadow of a mighty name.","Great fear is concealed under daring.","I have a wife, I have sons: all of them hostages given to fate.","The gods conceal from men the happiness of death, that they may endure life.","Nobody ever chooses the already unfortunate as objects of his loyal friendship."],"Lucas Black":["No matter what we're trying to accomplish in life, or what career path we're trying to take, sometimes we get caught up and lose perspective on what's important in life.","If you have to change something about you to be in a part, I don't think it's easy to do. You should just pick the part where you can just be yourself.","If you're thinking clearly and are content about where your life is - to where you can just think about the present, think about the now - that's what you need to do to hit good golf shots. I know there are a lot of distractions, but when you're thinking clearly, you're more free. You've got to have that freedom on the golf course.","When I'm not acting, I'm playing golf. I'm pretty passionate about it.","I've never been one to throw clubs, break clubs, or use bad language on the golf course. I've played with golfers who've done that, and I really hate to see it. If I did something like that, my dad would come get the putter and hit me upside the head with it. I knew better.","I have aspirations to try and compete professionally. Any golfer that competes in tournaments would be lying if they said they didn't.","You know, when you're trying to get better at golf, you're always measuring your game up against other people to see what you've got to do to get better and to see if you can compete with them."],"Lucas Grabeel":["The greatest thing about where my life is right now is it's very relaxed and chill. I'm just hanging out, being myself and doing my work.","I'm competitive with myself, but not with other people. I set goals for myself. I don't really care about winning or losing as long as I do my best.","Every day it seems like something happens to assure me I'm in the right place, and that doing anything else would be wrong. I feel so incredibly blessed.","Success is the most important to many, to me it's just a bonus.","I don't care about money or fame or anything like that, but it would be a perk.","It's nice to know you're working on something that will mean something to kids.","I always wish life could be a musical. One person just says 5, 6, 7, 8.","As far as my dreams go, all I want to do is be a working actor, and I happily achieved that.","I dislike math, yet I respect and appreciate the fact that math is the language of the universe.","I grew up with the classics. My mom and I would sit and watch 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'White Christmas' - those kind of movies.","I hope to be a producer, a musician, a painter, a photographer - I'm going to push myself to do as many things as I can and see where it goes.","I play, like, 12 instruments. Guitar, piano, harmonica, African drums... I'm working on mastering the accordion.","I really want to do more mature, artistic, twisted, edgy films. That is my goal.","In high school, I was Mr. Choir Boy. I had solos, I was helping out the tenors with their parts and our choir teacher would ask me what songs we should do."],"Lucas Hedges":["I'd love to do a love story. I've never done a true love story, which would be awesome. But then again, I don't think I've had a true love story, even in my own life. Maybe that's something I want to explore in my own life first.","The more you learn to love yourself, the better actor you will be. That's always going to be my training. Every part is, 'How can I learn to love myself more?'","I don't know what's in store for me, but I know that I want to create work, and I want to create an environment where I can bring in my favorite people and collaborate with them, and do something that is so much weirder and so different from what you'd see in commercial film.","You're living your life the entire time in both worlds - it's not like they say, 'Action' and you're like, 'Here we go, we're in this thing,' because that's where bad acting comes from.","Ultimately, I think what I want from my career is to be able to create work for myself, and there's only so much you can do as an actor in a movie.","I have allergic reactions: it triggers my gag reflex when I read unrealistic dialogue from a teenager.","I think I was born to be a clown. I just haven't figured out how to bring that side of myself into the world of filmmaking. It's much more comfortable for me to cry on a film set than it is to tell a joke.","It's nauseating for me when I feel like I'm not growing or challenging myself.","I know that I want to consistently return to doing plays. That's one of the most important things because I think it's the best place for me to learn how to act.","I am somebody who never came close to a physical altercation, because I was too scared of even getting near one - I'd probably just start crying.","I believe that a great character can be made in one scene, or a few moments.","I think it's true of every great comedy that it's rooted in some dramatic, incredibly personal truth. And it's true of all great drama that there has to be comedy.","It's almost like the psychology of a film is no different from the psychology of a person in that it has to function, it has to breathe, it has to have its releases, it has anxiety.","Technically, my first paying job was I was an extra in my dad's movie 'Dan in Real Life.'","I did the plays in middle school. I was cast as a gate in my fourth grade play, and every year I got a bigger role. Then, in 7th grade, I played Smike in 'Nicholas Nickleby,' and the casting director saw me and asked me to audition for a movie. That movie led to me getting 'Moonrise Kingdom.'","The great thing about scenes that involve nervous breakdowns - in the little experience I have doing them - is that there's no way to craft it. You just have to do it, and it sort of crafts itself in just being incredibly messy.","My problem with my parents growing up was not that I was afraid to cry in front of them - they always wanted me to cry because they wanted me to be okay, but it felt kind of icky and gross to cry in front of my parents. So my problem was the polar opposite - I didn't want to cry in front of them because I didn't want to give them the satisfaction.","I'm not sure I would want to be a filmmaker, because I've seen how many people they have to go through in order to create their own movie. It doesn't seem like something I can imagine putting myself through.","I meditate - very pretentious - and I try to read as much as I can and swim at the Y.","I never really thought it would be possible to keep making films. I thought I'd get to a point where it would just stop happening, and I still sort of feel that way. I don't know if any actor feels like they are going to have a career forever, unless they're a movie star.","In high school, I made friends with people in every social group. Or at least that's how I perceived it. I thought they liked me. Maybe they didn't!","I grew up in a film-loving family. We watched the Oscars every year. My favorite thing in the whole world was film. The Oscars obviously was the holy grail.","All it really takes to fall in love with a script is to understand, right off the bat, one piece of the story.","I did a theater program the summer of my junior year, and that's when I really fell in love with the craft of acting. It became more about the craft and less about being a working actor.","I would absolutely be interested in doing a Broadway production if it was the right project. But my dream is to be writing pieces of theater for my best friends and putting on plays in New York City and seeing our vision come alive. I just hope to always be creating.","In my bedroom, I have my yoga mat and the puppets I've made over the years, and because I'm very into smells, I have some burned sage on my bedside to help clear my head.","When I was in high school, I tried too hard to be cool and to impress people, but playing all these different characters has helped me find myself again.","The ten-block radius around my house in Brooklyn has been my whole world. When I walk on the street, I feel like I've rediscovered my childhood innocence. I love it because nothing has changed.","This is my life! I'm not getting a lot of sleep, but I am getting a lot of frequent-flyer miles.","If I have a career in theater, and nobody knows who I am, I'm all right with that.","The first thing I ever auditioned for was a movie called 'Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close.' And, this is kind of a secret, but it came down between me and the one other kid for it, but I didn't get it, so.","My dad's a filmmaker, and my mom's an actress. She was the original understudy, actually, for Harper in 'Angels in America' and did the show for about several months while she was pregnant with my older brother. And so I grew up obsessed with film and filmmaking.","I don't have social media. I don't have Facebook or Instagram or Snapchat.","If I did have social media, I would spend way to much time on it. It is way too addictive for me.","I grew up playing squash. I have all these squash trophies in my room... I was, like, third in the country.","Acting is not about showing what you're feeling. It's about doing something. It's about what you're doing for the other person. Anything other than 'doing' is not grounded in the truth."],"Lucas Neff":["That honeymoon phase is so much fun in real life, when you meet and discover somebody new and fall in love and chase them. The pursuit. And that climactic final moment of ultimate togetherness.","There's sort of a very symbiotic thing that happens on good TV shows with great writers, which is that they start to sort of embrace who the actors are and try to make the roles more specific to what they bring and what they can do.","I'm a big John Steinbeck fan. Cormac McCarthy. I've always loved the stories of regular people. Mark Twain, too. When you look back at some of the epic writers of our country's history, very rarely do you find upper-class royalty. We seem to delve into the struggle of life and the labor of life much more frequently.","Ninety percent of the time, I'm wearing imaginary people's clothing. I don't feel a huge pressure to go out and, like, hit the town, hit the boutiques.","I really don't want to do anything that resembles stand-up comedy. But I will agree to say that I am doing it, and I will hope that people expect it to be that, so I can thwart those expectations.","Yes, I want kids. I don't know that I'll ever be ready. But, I'll certainly want them. I'll have them regardless of whether I am ready, I think. I just don't have a timeframe on it yet.","I'm certainly not a trained singer. The only place I could probably carry a tune is my shower.","To be honest, I can't wait to be a dad. I really hope that that's how the cookie crumbles for me.","I'm a young actor and I haven't learned everything there is about acting.","Working on 'Raising Hope' is a very hurry-up-and-wait activity, and I just always liked the idea of being as productive as I can be. I write because I don't just want that time to dissolve, where I'm sitting in a trailer staring blankly at the paintings of moccasins that came with the trailer.","I think that's part of the fun of being an actor - you get to not be normal all of the time.","It's ridiculous. My life's been a series of happy accidents."],"Lucas Papademos":["The new co-operation government will do the best it can to address the country's problems, and I believe that with the co-operation of all - and the new government stresses this - and the unity of all, we will achieve that.","More cuts were needed to avoid exiting the eurozone.","I am not a politician but I have dedicated the biggest part of my professional life to economic policy both in Greece and Europe.","The financial crisis in our country is not a passing storm. Given the size of the problems, our national effort will not be completed in 2012. It will take many years and will require the efforts and insistence of several governments.","Governments cannot assume or expect that the ECB will always facilitate their funding independently of the achievement of their fiscal and other policy objectives.","The participation of our country in the eurozone is a guarantee for the country's monetary stability. It is a driver of financial prosperity.","A very difficult year is ahead of us. We must continue our efforts with decisiveness, to stay in the euro, to make sure we do not waste the sacrifices and do not turn the crisis into an uncontrolled and disastrous bankruptcy.","Our membership of the euro is a guarantee of monetary stability and creates the right conditions for sustainable growth. Our membership of the euro is the only choice.","The ECB's interventions in sovereign bond markets should not be perceived or interpreted as a 'freebie' for governments. They are temporary.","Dealing with Greece's problems will be more difficult if Greece is not a member of the eurozone.","And judging what is appropriate or not appropriate for a country, I think it is important in particular in judging what is the appropriate economic policy framework, one should take into account the overall political environment and the institutional framework within which economic policy operates.","My job will not be easy but I am convinced the problems will be solved in a quicker and more efficient way if there is unity and consensus.","Our position in Europe is not negotiable. The Greek people will defend it by all means. But participation in the euro involves rules and obligations, which we must consistently meet. Greece belongs to Europe and Europe cannot be envisaged without Greece.","I think it's often discussed that leaving the Euro is an option for Greece. I think this is really not an option.","So it won't be a surprise when the Greek default actually happens and we expect it one way or the other to be relatively soon.","Our eurozone partners have made it clear: The choice is between staying in or getting out of the eurozone.","I thank all of those deputies who supported the government and gave it a vote of confidence. I believe each of those votes represents a responsible decision to avoid placing our country's membership of the eurozone in danger.","I take office during the most difficult moment in the country's recent history. The country can be saved - it's up to us. I think it is obvious for those who support this government to undertake the commitment and ensure that our country's euro membership is not endangered.","The government is determined to continue the process of fiscal consolidation and structural reform in order to secure sound public finances and improve the country's international competitiveness.","Greece could default on its debts and even exit currency bloc if it cannot deliver reforms.","I think achieving a higher fiscal stability is also a very important condition for restoring an environment which is conducive to growth.","We must all assume out responsibilities to take the country forward.","I think the gains to be achieved by a combination of reforms and labor market adjustments are going to be more permanent and will provide a basis for reducing unemployment and improving export performance, and sustaining growth, in a way that is more sound and permanent.","I think the facts reveal that the European partners have taken extraordinary measures to help Greece address its problems.","I am personally convinced - and I think the Greek people share this belief in a fundamental way - that we can achieve fiscal consolidation more effectively and we can restore competitiveness in a more fundamental and permanent way within the euro area than outside.","I think the funds that have been pledged at Euro Summit, combined with the outcome of the private sector involvement process should be sufficient in order to support financially the Greek Economy.","I am convinced that the public, large majority of the Greek people, realize that policies pursued in the past and the market practices have to be changed, in order to improve the prospects of the Greek economy. So there is, I think, strong public support despite the increases in social tensions.","Delays in granting of justice very often reduce the speed with which investment could be undertaken, discouraging investors.","In the 20 years before Greece end up with the Euro, efforts to improve competitiveness through exchange rate and adjustments resulted only in temporary gains of competitiveness.","Greece is at a crucial crossroads. The choices that are made and the policies that are enforced will have a decisive impact on the wellbeing of Greeks. The way forward will not be easy but the problems can be solved, and will be solved, if there is unity, co-operation and consensus.","I am confident that we can overcome this crisis, provided that we remain united in our effort to address our debt and competitiveness problems. And I think that the Greek people are united; it's important also that the political forces are united in line with the will of the Greek people."],"Lucas Till":["Hard work always wins in the end.","'Monster Trucks' is like a big action movie.","When you say 'Monster Trucks,' people don't think monsters inside of trucks.","I'm sure there are some haters out there, but I just put my blinders on.","I'm a huge video gamer, sometimes a little too much. I'll shut myself in my room just so I can play video games all day and I end up neglecting my friends.","I grew up with a truck. My dad had one, so I like trucks.","My uncle is a mechanic, and I wish I had paid more attention, but I never did.","I would describe my relationship with my couch as symbiotic - others would describe it as dangerous.","I don't want to have anything to do with that: just the fame without personal respect for your privacy.","If you had known me in middle school, I was definitely not what someone would think of as Brad Pitt. That was not me. I was kind of a dork.","'Crush' was my first number one on the call sheet.","If you talk to anyone who's done a stair fall, there's not one stair fall, no matter how many pads you have on or how protected you are, where you don't hurt something really bad.","All I wanted was attention from girls when I was a kid. Then I got my braces off, and then there was too much attention, and I was also mad that they didn't pay attention to me in the first place. Then I was just like, I couldn't put on blinders and focus on one because there were too many options.","If you're a fan, you can appreciate everything I say.","Portraying Alex Summers, I want to look as athletic as his character is in the comics.","Emily Osment has 'osteo-old-woman-itis.'

Well, I never actually built one. But I did get them as a gift, for, like, 3 Christmases in a row, and I hated them.","I always try to plan things out, but they never work out the way I expect.","When I was a kid, I loved Jackie Chan.","We all grew up with Chevy Chase and Bill Murray.","That one was stunt heavy. 'Monster Trucks' was a lot of stunts. I got to do some insane stunts they should've never let me do.","Growing up, I'd watch 'Rambo' or 'Commando,' and so many action heroes were these huge guys with six-pack abs. It almost became a novelty.","I want to be relatable. I want to be the guy that people root for.","It's refreshing going from getting picked on in middle school to getting my name screamed out across the street.","I think you'd have to live under a rock to not know who MacGyver is.","I was really just too small for football.","It felt so good and natural, I should have been on a horse my entire life. I fell in love with riding.","I'm not a big fan of guitar face: you know, when someone's playing guitar, and they make this really embarrassing face, like they smush their lips together and... they look you in the eye, and it's really humiliating.","I love to dance. I've been told I'm actually really good.","Every time I work with real Southern actors... we immediately go into white trash, and we just get along really well within one night, you know.","Man, the '80s were pretty wacky. You had some stuff that was just so rad and some stuff that was just so wrong.","The show is called 'MacGyver,' and I've got to be there every day. There are probably a lot of girls out there watching the show that I don't have time to talk to.","My dad's nickname was MacGyver when we were kids. He'd hijack my projects all the time. When I got older, he would not do it as much... but he would just end up hijacking the whole thing. You should see the look in his eyes when he gets to create stuff.","I was a small kid.","See, it's kind of like James Bond. There's a new James Bond every couple of years. Maybe I can do the new 'MacGyver' and put my own twist on it.","When I was a kid, I think I wanted to be Arnold Schwarzenegger.","Most actors are like, 'I want to be more like Marlon Brando.' But when I was a little kid, I just wanted to be an action hero! Then I grew up, and my interests were different.","I'm a 'Fast & Furious' fan.","All my childhood dreams have come true.","I'm really into video games.","I've kind of been in a video game, I've kind of been an action figure. It was actually a Barbie doll, so that's why I say kind of, but if I can get made fun of on 'South Park' or 'Family Guy,' then I'll know that I've done something good with my life.","'Paranoia' was pretty awesome because it was the cast of 'Air Force One,' Gary Oldman and Harrison Ford back together, pitted against each other again, so that was pretty neat.","Angus is a pretty crappy name.","I've always dreamed of being a superhero, and I actually got to play one!","I would love to do my own stunts, but stunts are not something I have a lot of experience with.","I always wanted to play characters, and that was definitely one - a Russian spy.","I don't think that 'Hannah' garnered a whole lot of respect from certain people.","'Hannah Montana' gets no disrespect from me because it's certainly done me a lot of favors.","Acting is not a normal job, no, but I don't think that takes me out of the game as far as having had the experience of being a hard worker.","I learned how to make an endoscope using a Swiss Army Knife, a cell phone camera, cell phone, and chewing gum.","I remember when I was first auditioning to be a part of it, I thought it would be way to cool and there was no way it would actually happen, so I still can't believe I'm in the 'X-Men' and I'm Havok.","I never read any of the comics, but I grew up on the animated series when I was a little kid - I guess it came out in 1992. So I've always been an 'X-Men' fan.","I have a healthy addiction to binge-watching TV.","I just finished a Jackie Chan movie, yes. That was an experience. I can mark that off on my bucket list.","I play a lot of video games, and I go to the gym.","If some guy said this to me, I wouldn't listen either, but one-rep max-outs are the dumbest things you can do to yourself.","'Legend of the Drunken Master' was my favorite.","I look for a girl without pretense who is sweet and intelligent - preferably brunette, but that's not completely important.","In 'Crush,' it still has a lot of elements of other genres, and then the horror is layered on top of it, especially towards the end.","I absolutely love genre movies. When I was a kid, I was really impacted by genre films and cult classics.","I don't want to sound trite, but 'Star Wars' really, really impacted me.","'Lord of the Rings' was my jam. I was so depressed when I realized that I couldn't live in Middle-earth. And I was so sad when I was eleven and didn't get a letter from Hogwarts saying that I was going to be a wizard!","I don't see any harm in working, getting out there, and practicing.","I had discipline in other areas but certainly not in athletics.","A lot of people when I walk into meetings are like, 'Come on, let's talk more about 'X-Men.' What's it like to be Havok?' It certainly has been opening a lot of doors.","My mom's a chemist, so she's pretty smart.","I love technology and I can handle myself around a computer.","It's funny: I've always wanted to grow my hair out ,and I always seem to get a movie right before it's sort of the right length or right after, and it's never timed right.","I don't really try too hard to be anything that I'm not.","I don't know about actually doing real productive work on my own car.","I don't want to be a part of something I don't want to watch.","I took Jujitsu for four years, which has no striking.","My dad had me in Taekwondo when I was a kid, but I didn't retain much of that.","I've always done a lot of stunts in the past, and I sound like I'm tooting my own horn here, but I've always impressed the people I've worked with, and they've let me do more and more."],"Luchino Visconti":["The prince in 'The Leopard' was a very complex character - at times autocratic, rude, strong - at times romantic, good, understanding - and sometimes even stupid, and above all, mysterious.","Don't underestimate Laura Antonelli. She's burning to do well. And then she has an extraordinary face, even without make-up. It's not with her that I'd discuss literature.

There's so much emphasis on playing perfectly in tune and being perfect and doing everything as it's written.","If you've been trained to listen to mistakes your whole life, you forget to listen to opportunities.","I've got, like, too many things that I'd like to try and do, so I'm trying to figure out where the natural pull is strongest.","I definitely think of myself as a musician first.","When I have a chunk of time that I can really dedicate to music, I really want to get into it. I want to do some really hard stuff and push myself.","Classical music is always a really great way for me to get my chops to where I want them to be."],"Lucian Freud":["I never think about my style but just try and make the pictures look believable.","The aura given out by a person or object is as much a part of them as their flesh.","The longer you look at an object, the more abstract it becomes, and, ironically, the more real.","My work is purely autobiographical... It is about myself and my surroundings.","I would wish my portraits to be of the people, not like them. Not having a look of the sitter, being them.","You ask why I'm fascinated by the human figure? As a human animal, I am interested in some of my fellow animals: in their minds and bodies.","A painter must think of everything he sees as being there entirely for his own use and pleasure.","Painting is sometimes like those recipes where you do all manner of elaborate things to a duck, and then end up putting it on one side and only using the skin.","Full, saturated colours have an emotional significance I want to avoid.","The painter must give a completely free rein to any feeling or sensations he may have and reject nothing to which he is naturally drawn.","The painter's obsession with his subject is all that he needs to drive him to work.","The paintings that really excite me have an erotic element or side to them irrespective of subject matter.","A painter's tastes must grow out of what so obsesses him in life that he never has to ask himself what it is suitable for him to do in art.","As far as I am concerned the paint is the person. I want it to work for me just as flesh does.","And, since the model he faithfully copies is not going to be hung up next to the picture, since the picture is going to be there on its own, it is of no interest whether it is an accurate copy of the model.","I am only interested in painting the actual person, in doing a painting of them, not in using them to some ulterior end of art. For me, to use someone doing something not native to them would be wrong.","I paint people not because of what they are like, not exactly in spite of what they are like, but how they happen to be.","I remember Francis Bacon would say that he felt he was giving art what he thought it previously lacked. With me, it's what Yeats called the fascination with what's difficult. I'm only trying to do what I can't do.","I want paint to work as flesh.","Now that I know what I want, I don't have to hold on to it quite so much.","Since the model he so faithfully copies is not going to be hung up next to the picture... it is of no interest whether it is an accurate copy of the model.","The character of the artist doesn't enter into the nature of the art.","The model should only serve the very private function for the painter of providing the starting point for his excitement.","The picture is all he feels about it, all he thinks worth preserving of it, all he invests it with. If all the qualities which a painter took from the model for his picture were really taken, no person could be painted twice.","There is a distinction between fact and truth. Truth has an element of revelation about it. If something is true, it does more than strike one as merely being so.","When I look at a body it gives me choice of what to put in a painting, what will suit me and what won't.","Whether it will convince or not, depends entirely on what it is in itself, what is there to be seen."],"Luciano Berio":["In music, as I find myself forever saying, things don't get better or worse: they evolve and transform themselves.","The relation between practical and spiritual spheres in music is obvious, if only because it demands ears, finger, consciousness and intellect."],"Luciano De Crescenzo":["We are each of us angels with only one wing, and we can only fly by embracing one another.","I have a concept of Naples that is not so much of a city, per se, but rather an ingredient of the human spirit that I detect in everyone, Neapolitan or not.

So everybody is a content maker and a content reactor.","If you want to get into the shoes of someone, it's not just about seeing and hearing. It is also about what you touch and what you smell.

If you look at the bulk of my material, it's about trying to find some strength through that.","Just because I'm talking about something that might have been a sad or painful situation doesn't mean that I'm sad or tortured 24 hours a day any more than anybody else is.","I'm dealing with things as they come along, and I'm talking about it.","I've had trouble being in relationships and writing. This has been a real problem for me. I don't know if it's because I'm not free to fantasize or create these fantasy things about other people.","The man I lived with is a Christian, so I would talk to him about it. What would this person do in the Bible? What's the story around this person? Generally, when people talk about characters in the Bible, there's one thing they're known for, like Job.","I am trying to get right with God. I'm sort of making a statement about the excessiveness.","In so many interviews, they bring up the sexual aspect of the record. I've had some journalists say it sounds like I'm lying down in bed singing with a microphone. It gets so old!","I'd rather play a few nights at the Fillmore than play one night at an arena.","You can't really praise somebody's work and then criticize the process.","Some of their best songs don't have bridges and choruses. So that made me think I should trust my instincts. My songs were okay, I figured. I didn't need to change anything.","I usually have an idea of how I want a song to sound, but I don't always know how to get there.","I have to try different things to see what works best. Other people get impatient with that.","I feel a lot more comfortable being me these days. I'm constantly told that my work is good. A lot of fans and a lot of other artists say my songs and albums mean a lot to them. Isn't that what's important?","It's really about living in your head... just looking out at the world, then going back into your head and tossing around a lot of ideas and coming out with something interesting to say.","I'm always coming up with ideas that have been inspired by memories, everyday life and this and that and the other.","Sometimes I might borrow something from a song I started a long time ago and see if I can grab something.","I love Emmylou Harris's version of my song, 'Sweet Old World.' Her intonation is great.","Back in the 1960s, I saw Peter, Paul and Mary. I was at that age, about 14, and I was mesmerized.","First thing, I throw on some jeans, a T-shirt and my Keds sneakers and make coffee. That is actually my favorite time of day. That is when I do my songwriting, when I am in writing mode.","My approach to recording and all that is pretty organic. It just has to do with all the songs I wrote; go in and record them.","I write the songs, go in and record them, then I listen to everything and decide how it all fits together.","The way I look at life, whatever I'm doing at that time in my life is going to be reflected in my songs, for the most part.","Of course, I'm older now. I'm in a different place in my life than when I wrote the songs for 'Car Wheels' or 'Essence' or whatever. Different things were going on.","I have a folder of scraps and pieces of paper with stuff, ideas for songs from the last 25 years; just little things, maybe early songs that I finished, but didn't think they were good enough.","I can speak for most songwriters - those breakup love songs are so easy to write, as far as the inspiration and all that.","I started writing songs, I guess, when I was about 13 or 14, but I didn't know if they were good enough yet or anything.","I certainly had my God-can-you-just-take-me-now-I've-just-had-it-I'm-checking-out-let-me-off-the-train-I'm-done kind of thing. But, you know, I would never actually do it. I just can't imagine what it would take to do that.","There's so many other things to write about than unrequited love."],"Lucio Tan":["Even the accomplished suffers setbacks sometimes. The more bitter the lessons, the greater the successes will be.","A journalist who doesn't bring a camera is like a warrior who doesn't carry a sword.","No matter how busy I am, I find time to read, day and night.","There was a time in the mid-'50s when the Philippines was in the same league as Japan economically and academics-wise.","My laptop helps me carry on my business functions and stay in touch with my executives when I'm abroad."],"Lucius Accius":["A man whose life has been dishonourable is not entitled to escape disgrace in death.","Indeed, wretched the man whose fame makes his misfortunes famous.","Let them hate so long as they fear.","Not at all do I trust augurs, who enrich the ears of others, so that they can enrich their own homes with gold.","Many, whose hearts are conquered by acute spite, roll out balanced tales from their own heart, which do not balance when you weigh words against deeds."],"Lucius Annaeus Seneca":["One of the most beautiful qualities of true friendship is to understand and to be understood.","True happiness is... to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future.","It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.","Wherever there is a human being, there is an opportunity for a kindness.","Luck is a matter of preparation meeting opportunity.","Brave men rejoice in adversity, just as brave soldiers triumph in war.","We are more often frightened than hurt; and we suffer more from imagination than from reality.","A gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a man perfected without trials.","If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable.","A gift consists not in what is done or given, but in the intention of the giver or doer.","Life is the fire that burns and the sun that gives light. Life is the wind and the rain and the thunder in the sky. Life is matter and is earth, what is and what is not, and what beyond is in Eternity.","It is quality rather than quantity that matters.","All cruelty springs from weakness.","The day which we fear as our last is but the birthday of eternity.","A sword never kills anybody; it is a tool in the killer's hand.","A happy life is one which is in accordance with its own nature.","Love in its essence is spiritual fire.","The greatest remedy for anger is delay.","Life, if well lived, is long enough.","You learn to know a pilot in a storm.","It is another's fault if he be ungrateful, but it is mine if I do not give. To find one thankful man, I will oblige a great many that are not so.","For greed all nature is too little.","A physician is not angry at the intemperance of a mad patient, nor does he take it ill to be railed at by a man in fever. Just so should a wise man treat all mankind, as a physician does his patient, and look upon them only as sick and extravagant.","Sometimes even to live is an act of courage.","It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare, it is because we do not dare that they are difficult.","A man who suffers before it is necessary, suffers more than is necessary.","Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful.","Ignorant people see life as either existence or non-existence, but wise men see it beyond both existence and non-existence to something that transcends them both; this is an observation of the Middle Way.","Expecting is the greatest impediment to living. In anticipation of tomorrow, it loses today.","There is no person so severely punished, as those who subject themselves to the whip of their own remorse.","Even after a bad harvest there must be sowing.","We should every night call ourselves to an account: what infirmity have I mastered today? what passions opposed? what temptation resisted? what virtue acquired? Our vices will abate of themselves if they be brought every day to the shrift.","Life's like a play: it's not the length, but the excellence of the acting that matters.","The wish for healing has always been half of health.","No one can be happy who has been thrust outside the pale of truth. And there are two ways that one can be removed from this realm: by lying, or by being lied to.","Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body.","He who is brave is free.","No man was ever wise by chance.","Shame may restrain what law does not prohibit.","Most powerful is he who has himself in his own power.","Those who boast of their descent, brag on what they owe to others.","God is the universal substance in existing things. He comprises all things. He is the fountain of all being. In Him exists everything that is.","Shun no toil to make yourself remarkable by some talent or other; yet do not devote yourself to one branch exclusively. Strive to get clear notions about all.

What madness is it to be expecting evil before it comes.","You must live for another if you wish to live for yourself.","It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, that is poor.","If a man knows not what harbor he seeks, any wind is the right wind.","A kingdom founded on injustice never lasts.","Genius always gives its best at first; prudence, at last.","As long as you live, keep learning how to live.","Shall I tell you what the real evil is? To cringe to the things that are called evils, to surrender to them our freedom, in defiance of which we ought to face any suffering.","Wisdom does not show itself so much in precept as in life - in firmness of mind and a mastery of appetite. It teaches us to do as well as to talk; and to make our words and actions all of a color.","The bravest sight in the world is to see a great man struggling against adversity.","The first and greatest punishment of the sinner is the conscience of sin.","The way is long if one follows precepts, but short... if one follows patterns.","It is more fitting for a man to laugh at life than to lament over it.","I don't trust liberals, I trust conservatives.","The approach of liberty makes even an old man brave.","Anger, if not restrained, is frequently more hurtful to us than the injury that provokes it.","The first step in a person's salvation is knowledge of their sin.","Modesty forbids what the law does not.","Success is not greedy, as people think, but insignificant. That is why it satisfies nobody.","No great genius has ever existed without some touch of madness.","The pressure of adversity does not affect the mind of the brave man... It is more powerful than external circumstances.","Consult your friend on all things, especially on those which respect yourself. His counsel may then be useful where your own self-love might impair your judgment.","There are more things to alarm us than to harm us, and we suffer more often in apprehension than reality.","We often want one thing and pray for another, not telling the truth even to the gods.","It is the superfluous things for which men sweat, - superfluous things that wear our togas theadbare, that force us to grow old in camp, that dash us upon foreign shores.","A person's fears are lighter when the danger is at hand.","It is the sign of a great mind to dislike greatness, and to prefer things in measure to things in excess.","There is no delight in owning anything unshared.","All art is but imitation of nature.","Everything is the product of one universal creative effort. There is nothing dead in Nature. Everything is organic and living, and therefore the whole world appears to be a living organism.","Everywhere is nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends.","Constant exposure to dangers will breed contempt for them.","When we are well, we all have good advice for those who are ill.","The less we deserve good fortune, the more we hope for it.","Poverty wants some, luxury many, and avarice all things.","No evil propensity of the human heart is so powerful that it may not be subdued by discipline.","Where fear is, happiness is not.","Every reign must submit to a greater reign.","Death is the wish of some, the relief of many, and the end of all.","Whenever the speech is corrupted so is the mind.","Wisdom allows nothing to be good that will not be so forever; no man to be happy but he that needs no other happiness than what he has within himself; no man to be great or powerful that is not master of himself.","One crime has to be concealed by another.","It is the failing of youth not to be able to restrain its own violence.","It is better, of course, to know useless things than to know nothing.","In war, when a commander becomes so bereft of reason and perspective that he fails to understand the dependence of arms on Divine guidance, he no longer deserves victory.","It is true greatness to have in one the frailty of a man and the security of a god.","No man enjoys the true taste of life, but he who is ready and willing to quit it.","We should give as we would receive, cheerfully, quickly, and without hesitation; for there is no grace in a benefit that sticks to the fingers.","Successful and fortunate crime is called virtue.","He who does not prevent a crime when he can, encourages it.","He who has great power should use it lightly.","The things hardest to bear are sweetest to remember.","Anger is like those ruins which smash themselves on what they fall.","To be able to endure odium is the first art to be learned by those who aspire to power.","Night brings our troubles to the light, rather than banishes them.","A quarrel is quickly settled when deserted by one party; there is no battle unless there be two.","The good things of prosperity are to be wished; but the good things that belong to adversity are to be admired.","I will govern my life and thoughts as if the whole world were to see the one and read the other, for what does it signify to make anything a secret to my neighbor, when to God, who is the searcher of our hearts, all our privacies are open?","Nothing is void of God, his work is everywhere his full of himself.","There is as much greatness of mind in acknowledging a good turn, as in doing it.","If you would judge, understand.","May be is very well, but Must is the master. It is my duty to show justice without recompense.","For many men, the acquisition of wealth does not end their troubles, it only changes them.","One must steer, not talk.","He who has made a fair compact with poverty is rich.","Not how long, but how well you have lived is the main thing.","The bad fortune of the good turns their faces up to heaven; the good fortune of the bad bows their heads down to the earth.","If thou art a man, admire those who attempt great things, even though they fail.","Every man prefers belief to the exercise of judgment.","There is nothing in the world so much admired as a man who knows how to bear unhappiness with courage.","Let us train our minds to desire what the situation demands.","Life is warfare.","If you judge, investigate.","A well governed appetite is the greater part of liberty.","No one is laughable who laughs at himself.","Whatever is well said by another, is mine.","What difference does it make how much you have? What you do not have amounts to much more.","Our care should not be to have lived long as to have lived enough.","We become wiser by adversity; prosperity destroys our appreciation of the right.","Behold a worthy sight, to which the God, turning his attention to his own work, may direct his gaze. Behold an equal thing, worthy of a God, a brave man matched in conflict with evil fortune.","Whatever fortune has raised to a height, she has raised only to cast it down.","Great grief does not of itself put an end to itself.","Health is the soul that animates all the enjoyments of life, which fade and are tasteless without it.","A great mind becomes a great fortune.","If you wished to be loved, love.","Every sin is the result of a collaboration.","Call it Nature, Fate, Fortune; all these are names of the one and selfsame God.","In war there is no prize for runner-up.","Consider, when you are enraged at any one, what you would probably think if he should die during the dispute.","Whatever one of us blames in another, each one will find in his own heart.","A great fortune is a great slavery.","There is a noble manner of being poor, and who does not know it will never be rich.","The mind unlearns with difficulty what it has long learned.","True praise comes often even to the lowly; false praise only to the strong.","We can be thankful to a friend for a few acres, or a little money; and yet for the freedom and command of the whole earth, and for the great benefits of our being, our life, health, and reason, we look upon ourselves as under no obligation.","No untroubled day has ever dawned for me.","The mind that is anxious about the future is miserable.","The deferring of anger is the best antidote to anger.","Crime when it succeeds is called virtue.","He has committed the crime who profits by it.","A punishment to some, to some a gift, and to many a favor.","Do everything as in the eye of another.","So live with men as if God saw you and speak to God, as if men heard you.","Our plans miscarry because they have no aim. When a man does not know what harbor he is making for, no wind is the right wind.","Nothing becomes so offensive so quickly as grief. When fresh it finds someone to console it, but when it becomes chronic, it is ridiculed, and rightly.","The display of grief makes more demands than grief itself. How few men are sad in their own company.","He who dreads hostility too much is unfit to rule.","That is never too often repeated, which is never sufficiently learned.","I never come back home with the same moral character I went out with; something or other becomes unsettled where I had achieved internal peace; some one or other of the things I had put to flight reappears on the scene.","To keep oneself safe does not mean to bury oneself.","That which is given with pride and ostentation is rather an ambition than a bounty.","Do not ask for what you will wish you had not got.","Precepts or maxims are of great weight; and a few useful ones on hand do more to produce a happy life than the volumes we can't find.","Every guilty person is his own hangman.","Why do I not seek some real good; one which I could feel, not one which I could display?","I shall never be ashamed of citing a bad author if the line is good.","A large part of mankind is angry not with the sins, but with the sinners.","It makes a great deal of difference whether one wills not to sin or has not the knowledge to sin.","Slavery takes hold of few, but many take hold of slavery.","When I think over what I have said, I envy dumb people.","Success consecrates the most offensive crimes.","When an author is too meticulous about his style, you may presume that his mind is frivolous and his content flimsy.","What nature requires is obtainable, and within easy reach. It is for the superfluous we sweat.","There is none made so great, but he may both need the help and service, and stand in fear of the power and unkindness, even of the meanest of mortals.","Time discovers truth.","It's not because things are difficult that we dare not venture. It's because we dare not venture that they are difficult.","The heart is great which shows moderation in the midst of prosperity.","See how many are better off than you are, but consider how many are worse.","What is true belongs to me!","Light troubles speak; the weighty are struck dumb."],"Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II":["The center of all my enjoyments is the home wherein are my wife and children, and I have no wish to wander out from that home in pursuit of any pleasures that the world presents.","Liberty does not exist where rights are on one side and power on the other. To be liberty, rights must be armed with vital powers. A people cannot be free who do not participate in the control of the government which operates upon them.","It is a law woven into the nature of man, attested by history, by science, by literature and art, and by dally experience, that strength of mind and force of character are the supreme rulers of human affairs.","I cannot write a speech. The pen is an extinguisher upon my mind and a torture to my nerves. I am the most habitual extemporaneous speaker that I have ever known.","The very first act of the Confederate Government was to send commissioners to Washington to make terms of peace, and to establish relations of amity between the two sections.","The nations of Europe constitute a federative league, a commonwealth of nations which, though it has no central head, is so intimate and elaborate as to subject the action, and sometimes even the internal affairs, of each to surveillance and intervention on the part of all the others.","When a nation has just emerged from the throes of a great civil warfare, where section was arrayed against section, class against class, two things are to be done: First, the work of reconstruction is to be effected; Secondly, a willingness for the proper acceptance of the issue's decision is to be created.","I formed, in early life, two purposes to which I have inflexibly adhered, under some very strong pressure from warm personal friends. They were, first, never to be a second in a duel; and, second, never to go security for another man's debts.","I think it eminently proper that a president should retire from active politics, and equally proper that he should be able to live in quiet independence."],"Lucky Blue Smith":["Put a puppy in your picture, and it will make it 20 times better.","A lot of my friends hate my music. I have weird taste.","I wear modern... vintage.","Honestly, if I'm around people I like, I can do nothing and have a good time. But when I have downtime, I like to go get a burger.","My parents have seen me flirt with girls in front of them, so they're kind of used to it.","I want to save up money. This is probably long-term, but I for sure want to get into real estate and flip houses and start doing stuff like that. So I'm saving money. And, you know, being a kid at the same time. I want people to know I'm literally just a 16-year-old punk who's trying to hang out with some homies on the weekends.","Walking is pretty easy. You just have to be confident, like not caring. And honestly, people think about their walk too much, so they try to do something really interesting, but the designers hate it.","I like a girl with a good personality that I can have fun with. If I am taking you out on a date, let's eat burgers and cheese fries.","Fashion is a way you can express yourself, so it's good stuff, you know?","I'm a professional model, but I still take crappy selfies.","I'm always trying to be a good example to people and always trying to do something cool. I really don't want to end up like that cliche celebrity teenager kid who is a bad example.","One of my favorite shots was on these, like, lava rocks - but moss was growing on it, and I was lying on it, and it was really green, and the picture was really pretty.","After I built up a following on Instagram, I realized it's a good way to talk to your fans. I always try to keep the conversation going - they're really happy when that happens.","Most of my friends are in the industry - photographers, models, stylists, and social media kids.","When I moved to L.A. a few years ago, my sister hung out with a couple of people with big followings. I'd hang out with them, too, and eventually was tagged in a picture with Acacia Brinley, who does a lot on YouTube. She got me from, like, 6,000 to 17,000 followers over a couple of days.","If you have a cool personality, the photographer will want to work with you because he or she will have more fun on set.","Being in this whole fashion industry, seeing it firsthand, I never realized just how much work goes into everything.","Designers want their clothes and their shows to be absolutely perfect, exactly as they imagined, and there is a great deal of work that goes into doing that. Some collections can tell a whole story, from the first look to the last. The way the colors and the clothes transition is very interesting.","I will never work in a cubicle.","I've been playing drums since I was 7.","What I want is to be well-respected around all ages and all around the world.","I don't know if any famous people follow me, but their daughters definitely do.","I don't want to be one of those kids who gets famous and then changes and becomes cocky. That's why it's so important to me to try and take a photo with every girl who comes to see me.","I did see 'Zoolander II,' and I thought it was a cool movie, but I liked the first one way more.","I love my name. I didn't used to when I was a kid. People called me Lucky Charms, after the breakfast cereal.","I never used to like how big my hands were because I hadn't grown into them yet.","When I was 12, there was a kid a couple of grades older than me who was picking on my sisters. No matter how big they were, I would defend them.","Luckily, I have a fast metabolism.","I'm in a band with my three sisters called the Atomics, which is awesome."],"Lucretia Mott":["We too often bind ourselves by authorities rather than by the truth.","The world has never yet seen a truly great and virtuous nation because in the degradation of woman the very fountains of life are poisoned at their source.","Let our lives be in accordance with our convictions of right, each striving to carry out our principles.","There is nothing of greater importance to the well-being of society at large - of man as well as woman - than the true proper position of woman.","Learning, while at school, that the charge for the education of girls was the same as that for boys, and that, when they became teachers, women received only half as much as men for their services, the injustice of this distinction was so apparent.","It is not Christianity, but priestcraft that has subjected woman as we find her.","Those who read the Scriptures and judge for themselves, not resting satisfied with the perverted application of the text, do not find the distinction that theology and ecclesiastical authorities have made in the condition of the sexes.","The laws given on Mount Sinai for the government of man and woman were equal; the precepts of Jesus make no distinction."],"Lucretius":["The drops of rain make a hole in the stone, not by violence, but by oft falling.","It is great wealth to a soul to live frugally with a contented mind.","From the very fountain of enchantment there arises a taste of bitterness to spread anguish amongst the flowers.","The fall of dropping water wears away the Stone.","Thus the sum of things is ever being reviewed, and mortals dependent one upon another. Some nations increase, others diminish, and in a short space the generations of living creatures are changed and like runners pass on the torch of life.","What is food to one man is bitter poison to others.","In the midst of the fountain of wit there arises something bitter, which stings in the very flowers.","Pleasant it is, when over a great sea the winds trouble the waters, to gaze from shore upon another's great tribulation; not because any man's troubles are a delectable joy, but because to perceive you are free of them yourself is pleasant.","Life is one long struggle in the dark.","Such are the heights of wickedness to which men are driven by religion.","Sweet it is, when on the high seas the winds are lashing the waters, to gaze from the land on another's struggles.","So potent was religion in persuading to evil deeds.","Pleasant it to behold great encounters of warfare arrayed over the plains, with no part of yours in peril.","The sum of all sums is eternity.","The greatest wealth is to live content with little, for there is never want where the mind is satisfied.","Though the dungeon, the scourge, and the executioner be absent, the guilty mind can apply the goad and scorch with blows.","Victory puts us on a level with heaven.","And life is given to none freehold, but it is leasehold for all.","From the heart of the fountain of delight rises a jet of bitterness that tortures us among the very flowers."],"Lucy Alibar":["I was a really bad teenager and I got my tongue pierced. I don't even remember where I did it, but it was under very surreptitious circumstances.","If you have a perfectionist streak - and who doesn't? - running can kill the perfectionist inside you.","Mostly I do Iyengar. I like anything that's hard enough to make me cry in class. I like to be pushed over my limit and broken down a little bit.","I wasn't the best waitress in the world, but I was cheerful and worked hard.","My grandmother had six kids - one died as an infant - and she was dirt-poor, and all her kids got an education. And my mom grew up poor. And they both worked so hard and cultivated so much of their own happiness. I wanted to have that like an amulet. Not like armor, but like a magic feather. Like Dumbo's magic feather.","My dad doesn't like religion much, but I grew up very close to the Baptist tradition. God isn't this distant thing. God is right here with you all the time. He's your buddy, and you can talk about everything.","It absolutely helped - to write the father in both 'Juicy' and 'Beasts,' I had to see the whole story from his point of view. All of a sudden I understood more of what my own father must be going through - the fear, the frustration, the anger... the hope that he'll leave a legacy.","I always felt like there wasn't a blueprint for father-daughter relationships - for them or for us. Because what are they supposed to do with us, treat us like boys, or small women, or what? Father-daughter relationships are so unique from family to family, and I'd love to watch it explored more onstage.","Oh, I love to read more than anything. I always love the 'New Stories From the South' anthologies - I think it's the best short fiction collection anywhere, just filled with treasures.","There are so many remarkable playwrights working right now, that I see everything I can. Annie Baker is a genius, I'll see anything she writes. The same for Lynn Nottage, Cynthia Hopkins, and Lisa D'Amour. Anything they've got going on, I'll go see.","I can't write about rich people having relationship problems and breaking up in New York. I don't know that world of Terrence McNally. I knew I had to write people who talk the way I talk. And they talked very different than Terrence McNally.","I think artists need the freedom to fail and I gave myself that freedom.","My dad, like many Southern men, is this very emotionally expressive person who isn't as articulate in words about his feelings as he is with breaking a chair or something like that.","To me the voice has always been the way to start any character. Once I find that, I'm good to go."],"Lucy Carless":["Being part of the Workshop is like being part of a really big family. Everyone is so close. Everyone feels the success of others who go on to do well. Whatever happens, I will still be part of the Workshop.","'Humans' seems to have gone down really well in the U.S. That doesn't happen for British TV drama - unless we're talking 'Downton Abbey.'","Whenever I start an acting job and talk to my fellow actors, and I tell them I am from Nottingham, they guess I'm from the Workshop, it's so well known."],"Lucy Dacus":["If there are people who treat me wrong, I either talk to them about it, or I don't talk to them anymore. It's been the most thoughtful and considerate thing I could do for myself and other people. I am going to try to do that forever.","'Night Shift' is the only breakup song I've ever written.","Negativity, in general, is one of the things that holds people back, and you have to see what's holding you back to get away from it.","For a while, I called myself an agnostic, which was me wanting to maintain a connection to the culture I was raised in while also undercutting a lot of the beliefs I had.","Questions don't easily die within me until they're answered, and so being able to write a song and put words to complex feelings is part of my process of understanding and letting go of things.","Every breakup is preceded by a bad relationship. So breakups should be cause for celebration and triumph.","I never considered a career in music because it was too unattainable. I just didn't believe it was possible.","There's a lot of art that's about loss and sadness, but I would love it if hopefulness were more of a cliche. That's the work that always sticks with me and emboldens me in life.","It's important for me to write songs that feel good to sing every night and remind me of my core, truest beliefs.","If you can come out from under pain, why wouldn't you? You definitely can. There's no question.","Music was always encouraged as a passion and a hobby, but I was never told, 'This should be your job. You write music and record for a living.' It doesn't happen for people.","The phrase 'no burden' largely captured what I wish people believed about themselves.","Speaking and singing were equally common in my house. I started songwriting about the time that I started forming sentences.","My mom is an elementary school music teacher, a pianist, and a singer, and my dad plays guitar - he's a huge Bruce Springsteen fan. My mom does musical theater, too. All of those influences were around.","I've been adjusting to what it means to be a songwriter, figuring out what I like about it and what I don't like about it and what it means to me as opposed to other people.","I really believe in hopefulness and respect people that are hopeful. I think I'm at my best when I think hopefully.","Even people that are close to me or people that are acquaintances... The only question I get now is, 'How is music going?' It's an overpowering quality of my life now, the fact that I write songs. It's weird to navigate what that means socially.","People actually tell me that I'm living my dream. And I'm like, 'It's a little more nuanced than that.'","Even if somebody wanted to tell me what one of my songs meant to him or her, I can't do it - I would be probably put to tears every time.","I think I've had extremes of being unable to exist outside of my own head, and then I only am existing for other people... There's a middle ground where I should take care of myself and other people.","I'm going to name my daughter Emily.","I would not say that my relationships are becoming shallow; if anything, some of them are really being tested in a way that I'm so thankful for my friends that call me and still want to talk.","What's cool about Matador is that everyone I've met there is just so chill and really into what they're doing. Everyone that works there, there's just such a lack of ego, and there's such a commitment to what they're doing. They all like each other.","It's weird to get asked questions that I don't know the answers to... But I like getting questions I don't know the answer to because maybe it's the first time I've been asked to articulate these things.","I've been journaling longer than I've been a musician, longer than I've been an artist, longer than I've been a writer in general.","I think a lot about my obsessive need to document things and what it's going to mean in the future.","From the very beginning, I had a lot of female role models in music. I would go to shows, and there were always women fronting bands and playing guitar or backing up and playing drums or bass in a band. That probably contributed to my belief in myself to go out and perform for people.","There have been a couple specific instances where I've felt like I couldn't survive without interacting with a certain person. I've been involved with some pretty manipulative people who have told me the same thought: that I can't live without them.","When I finished reading '100 Years of Solitude,' by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, I got really sad. I thought, 'This will never happen for me, for the first time, ever again.' Then I opened 'Beauty Is a Wound.' It's a completely different story and writing style, but it has a similar place in my heart now.","Really unfiltered personal writing is cool to me. I'm like, 'How did you show that to everyone?'","A journal is your completely unaltered voice - it's just for you. And if you know that voice, and you like it, you can bring it out to everyone else, and that's the most honest and vulnerable thing you can do.","It's one thing to make something, and then it's another thing to put it in front of other people.","We were so limited on time for 'No Burden' that we didn't get to overthink anything. There was no going for the perfect take, or even going for three takes. It was kind of nice because what you're hearing is our first impulse.","Whenever I'm trying to understand people that I don't understand, or things in people or even in myself, I'll say, 'When did this negativity get here?' I try to think back to how I was raised to deal with things, and then consider how the person that I'm dealing with grew up.","It's true that no child is born knowing there's an evil thing. You learn what is ugly.","I can't imagine being in a tour bus. It would be nice, but I think it costs $30,000 a week to rent. And I can't imagine spending what many people make in a year on a vehicle for one week.","I love Led Zeppelin!","I don't retain facts very well when it comes to music history.","I haven't studied history - I couldn't give a discourse in medieval literature - but I am a personal historian, and I do a lot to take in the histories of the people around me.","I take photos, I used to make films, I journal incessantly, and I really value the documentation of life. Because it's almost like you are making something special by wanting to make it exist in an object - on paper or even just in the computer - making these recordings, making this music.","You have to laugh at things in order to let them be what they truly are. Because nothing is only sad. Nothing is only funny. There's context to all of those things.","I just feel like you're being realistic if you can laugh at yourself.","I guess the point of that song 'Troublemaker, Doppelganger' is trying to navigate the worth of beauty and if it's hurtful or helpful to value beauty. If it's a curse or a blessing. Is that something really negative and morbid, like the hearse, or is it the limousine - a glamorous symbol of enjoying life?","The media, and how we're taught to read it, has a huge impact on who we become as people.","When you're a kid, you learn whatever your parents think until you start taking in media. Because all your friends are your age as well, media is the third parent that you ever have. So I think about that a lot, what visual imagery is teaching us, and media in general having a huge impact.","I really enjoy navigating the business aspect of having a band, and there is a great amount of instinct. You don't wanna work with people who make you feel weird, even if they're super qualified.","I like to think of hope as a fact and something that wins out always. Whether you're hopeful or not, actually, you do get through what you're in the middle of. When you're in it, you don't feel like that's possible. But time and time again, we're proven wrong.","Being on tour, it's really easy to stop knowing people that you want to know, because you're not sharing experiences; you're not existing in the minor moments of somebody's life.","I've written in the middle of a conversation or the grocery store or at another band's concert or in the last moments before falling asleep. It's pretty unpredictable. I think it's always flowing, and sometimes I'm not listening. There's no formula for when I'm going to be able to be a good listener to myself.","There is no 'stop' - there's always 'go' on both sides: always keep writing, always keep recording. I don't find them to be segmented processes.","I'm never writing as a character.","I don't even drink coffee. I try to avoid becoming reliant on any substance.","You don't have to make something in order to retain your identity as an artist or a writer or a creative person. A lot of people think they have to be producing in order to maintain that identity.","I don't have any weird gimmicks. I do put on lipstick for the show. That's what separates it. 'Cause I don't wear makeup at all... That's probably the closest thing I have to a routine.","Film is like sculpture, writing, acting, technical arts, all sorts of arts. And that's why I wanted to do it for so long, because it would include so many places for attention.","My mom is an elementary-school music teacher. For her, music is an educational tool.","My dad plays guitar in the church band, so it's like music as a service. He plays at old-people homes, so that's like music as a gift.","In middle school, you're figuring out how you're affecting people, and sometimes you're affecting people negatively. And what sucks is that it can affect people for their whole lives. I didn't realize I was a part of that.","I called it 'Historian' because I feel like most of my creative efforts are efforts to capture something or to document it.","I will say it is funny that writing a song about not wanting to entertain people is what got me a career in entertainment.","I was adopted, and so was my mom. And so I just was in tune with how life can be intentional. I feel like maybe that helped me to not feel super entitled to a lot of things as a kid.","That's my main complaint with Murakami: that he writes these complex males and then really static women.","Four months after we released 'I Don't Want to Be Funny Anymore,' the album came out on EggHunt. Three months after that, we officially signed with Matador. That's not a very long time: half a year between the first flood and the final signing.","I heard during our label-searching that some labels hire statisticians instead of A&R people. They'll reach out to the bands that will statistically perform best monetarily instead of going out to shows and having an opinion on which music is good or bad.","Yo La Tengo were a major inspiration for me because they're one of the first bands that I got into on my own, separate from my parents, when I was in high school. I have all their albums. That's the place we'd like be in someday.","I hear a lot of artists become kinda self-referential, and a lot of people that tour a lot tend to write about the perils of being on the road later in their careers.","Joan Didion's 'The Year of Magical Thinking' comes to mind as an example of a piece of media that I really respect and would hope to emulate: just her courage in looking at her husband's death and the attentiveness that she has in how she looks at it, and the unflinching gaze that she communicates from looking into death.","'No Burden' is not necessarily ferocious.","I always wrote songs. Elementary school, middle school. It didn't feel more creative than speaking. It was just normal to do that.","My favorite music is when the sound is supplementing the message. I don't think it's dramatic; it's cinematic.","A breakup is a state of mind that needs encouragement and needs hopeful, forward thinking.","Usually, I'll just be walking from my house to somewhere else, and melodies and words will start coming up, and I'll have to run home to write it all down.","I have a huge note on my phone where things just start popping up. It doesn't make that much sense to me at the time, but once a song is finished, I can read into it and figure out who the characters are in my life.","Hopefully when you listen to a song, you can say, 'That's me,' or 'That's someone I know' - you relate to it in a way that's cathartic.","I was the funny one in my group; there was a lot pressure to be responsible for everyone's happiness. I didn't like watching other friends of mine be called the 'pretty one' or the 'smart one.' That had no depth, and it didn't match how I knew them.","The main way that being adopted has shaped my songwriting is that I was asked at an early age to consider the circumstances that led to my life, and in a way, I was introduced to how fragile and unlikely life is from the beginning.","I was always taught to be grateful, and so the question came early: What is there to be grateful for? Why is life supposed to be so good? That's still a question I try to answer all the time.","I don't end up writing songs in my journals, but I'm sure that my ability to write songs has been helped by how consistently and impulsively I try to get my life into words through the journals.","Writing has never been an intentional endeavor to me. I know a lot of people have experiences and then sit down and try to sort them out through song, but whenever I sit down to write, it comes out hackneyed or overly saccharine.","I value the people who are willing to make themselves vulnerable and share work that is sensitive and maybe even hard to sing sometimes. Because that's the music that provides the most solace and solidarity to the world.","It seems like there's a real world for new ideas in Philly.","When I'm on a stage, it's just me, singing a song with words that I wrote and I believe in. And if I don't believe in them anymore, I'll stop singing that song.","I couldn't have imagined working on a film I didn't believe in.","I think 'Historian' is ultimately a positive record, but I was a little bit worried about taking people into a dark world. I tried to do it with as much care as possible, but it's not easy to ask people to think about death or loss or confusion.","I think in 'No Burden' there was a lot of positivity on the record.","I'm not a big risk-taker - being bad just wasn't worth my time or the risk of having the consequences for it. So maybe I'm a little bit lame for that.","In film school, you get skills, but then you get lackey jobs, working on projects that you probably don't care about. And there's something in me where I just couldn't bring myself to edit some misogynistic rom-com or movies that I would have hated to be a part of. So I knew I just wouldn't get any work because of that.","Before I even pick up a guitar, usually the words are done. So I'm not first and foremost a musician. I'm first and foremost a writer.","I've talked with friends about this: when you write about yourself, that's what people connect to. When you write a sermon or a lesson, that may not reach people. I've learned a lot from people who have been writing about themselves.","There was never an 'a-ha' moment when a spider bit me and I knew I could write songs. For that reason, I don't know if I'm always going to be able to. I want to write songs forever, but it's an elusive thing.","I was always writing. I've always been attracted to words and stories, communication.","Humans are fascinated with communication. I was always drawn to words and stories, staying in touch with your feelings and being open to what's around you.","I feel like the expectations have gone up. It's not a complaint, but it's a little intimidating. People are like, 'Oh, you're on Matador. It's kind of a legendary label - you're going to have to live up to all those other bands.' I guess it's not that explicit.","Headliners, no matter the genre, usually are a person or band who has an ethos."],"Lucy Davis":["For me, when I go to bed at night, I am happy that I haven't hurt someone. And if I think I have, I will rectify it. I now refuse to give someone permission to make me feel bad about myself. They can't make me feel bad about myself if I don't allow it.","I was fortunate to have had a lively, happy childhood, but somewhere along the way I convinced myself I wasn't wanted anywhere or by anyone if I wasn't thin.","I work much better in sunshine. It's drizzle and grayness that I don't like.","If I'm slimmer, I feel better about myself, but I don't lose weight for anybody else or for a magazine.","I struggle because I love food and sometimes I can't stop eating.","The joy I get from work is just huge.","I have been very lucky - all the jobs I've done have been with lovely people. In fact, I've been on many where I've just laughed uncontrollably the whole time.","I love shutting my front door and being at home with just my dog and me. That's when I'm happiest.","I have come a long way and learnt a lot. I read this quote about a year ago: 'Happiness must not be pursued; it must ensue.' It's made me realise that just being married again or something like that won't make me happy; the happiness ensues from how we live our lives."],"Lucy Deakins":["My character Milly in 'The Boy Who Could Fly' was a very strong part. There were dramatic moments, and there were humorous moments, too. The whole story with Eric Underwood's character was just wonderful, and the messages behind the script were very important to me.","For me, it was a choice between band and drama - and I hated the band teacher.","Soaps have a schedule where you have to be done in 15 minutes. With an hour show, there's no way to get off schedule. On a movie, it's a lot easier to go back and reshoot scenes. I wasn't used to that at all... taking the time to really make each scene as good as it can be, which you can't do on soaps.","My parents don't press it but, you know, they're into good grades.","I was a painfully shy person in my pre-acting days."],"Lucy Fisher":["I like all kinds of movies. I really do.","Just selling through a movie theater is not ever going to be a viable way to make money back on a movie anymore.","The earliest movies that I loved were French movies and Italian movies. I grew up watching those kind of movies and often find the truest looks at human nature - you can find them in another country's movies.","There's nothing worse than making a good movie that doesn't get seen."],"Lucy Fry":["I get really excited when I get to go out on these press tours and meet fans, do signings and interact, and they can ask questions. Social media is a great way to do that, and I wish I was better at it, but I'm just not.","I want to be a part of the stories that need to be told.","I like it when a script shows you something new, and you can learn something through the journey of a film rather than being told things you already know.","The first time I came to California was in January 2013, when I auditioned for 'Vampire Academy.'","'Vampire Academy' was a night shoot, so I got to know London in the darkness and had free time during the day. I saw a lot of theater while I was there.","I'm a relaxed person, and I kind of just wear anything; I don't put that much time and care into planning an outfit.","I want to try and wear as many Australian designers as I can because I'd like to support my Australian colleagues in the industry as well as find things that are eco-friendly. I love the green concept of wearing more sustainable garments at events."],"Lucy Griffiths":["My biggest fear is looking weak, girly, and pathetic.","You either end up on a good, fun show that's successful, or you have that question mark in your future, and you know that you don't know what's going to happen, which is exciting.","I know that some people think differently about pilots, but I really enjoyed shooting 'Awakening'.","I don't watch a great deal of television because I don't have a television, and I don't have a huge catalog of films that I've watched, either.","When I do watch things, they tend to be a lot of comedies. I actually like some of the British comedy series. But, on the whole, I'm not a huge viewer of anything.","I fight like Bruce Lee. I train in his style of kung fu, wing chun. It's all about fighting with controlled power, so you learn to punch correctly.","I talked my parents into sending me to Roedean at 16. I had this idea that if I could get into Cambridge, then I could join Footlights. My problem was that I went to a comprehensive in Brighton. I thought I'd have to start from a good school, and the best I could think of was Roedean.","Catherine Zeta-Jones started out like me. Her big break in Hollywood was in 'Zorro.'","Professionally, I did a couple of operas when I was in school, when I was 18.","I mostly did musicals and concerts when I was younger, and then I realized I don't quite have the voice for it, so I went into acting, which I enjoy more.","The complaint with me being on stage was always that I was slightly too naturalistic and not projecting enough. I've got quite a soft voice, so that didn't help.","Your personal life is something that's gonna last forever, and your career in stage, film, television, whatever, is not necessarily going to do that, so to keep the two separate's a very good thing."],"Lucy Hale":["Surround yourself with the right people, and realize your own worth. Honestly, there are enough bad people out there in the world - you don't need to be your own worst enemy.","But little white lies here and there is human nature. Everybody does that.","My favorite toy growing up was Polly Pocket. But one gift that I wanted though never received for Christmas was a pair of trampoline moon shoes. You strap them to your feet and they have springs on them, and you can just jump around!","The image you see of me out in public is really different from who I am in real life.","I feel like girls in general will always worry about the same things, and it's all appearance related. That will always be there. When you grow older, you grow more confident with who you are.","I get bored easily.","I don't really believe in cliques - I think everyone can be friends with everyone.","I'm so boy-crazy. It's like I don't even know what's wrong with me. I love boys.","You only get one album. You only get one single. You get one shot in music. But I have a million different dreams. Why can't I go out and try to achieve them all? Who are you to say I can't?","I just love the thrill of performing on stage. I believe that singing is something I was put here to do.","I love 'Paranormal Activity' and 'The Exorcist.' 'The Shining' is a great one too, but there's not a lot that scares me. Maybe it's because I know the other side of it, and I know how movies are made, but it takes a lot for me to get freaked out.","I was sort of in denial about doing country for awhile but I sort of grew up and realized who I was, what I wanted to say. I think country music is the best music in the world and I'm glad to be doing a country album. I hope people will love it as much as I loved making it.","I'd love to go to fashion week! I'm learning more about designers, thanks to 'Pretty Little Liars' costume designer, Mandi Line.","I definitely used to lie about my age. I'm from Tennessee and everyone would vacation in Destin, Florida, where there are lots of cute guys. I would go with my older sister and lie about my age to them.","I have always known that I wanted to be a singer and I knew that meant sacrificing some things for my dream. When I am home I hang out with my friends and go to dances, so I try and partake in some of the activities that I miss out on.","My ultimate dream is to become a famous star because I love to sing.","I grew up performing and singing. And acting, the idea of it just sort of fell into my lap. And I was a little hesitant at first, but I was like, 'Okay, I'll try it.'","There were a lot of heads turning when people found out I was doing music and when they found out it was country, they were like, 'What?'","I was lucky enough to grow up in a home where I woke up Christmas morning and had toys. I know that's not the case with all people and I don't think kids should go without experiencing that sort of joy.","The acting part of me is not me. The music side is who I really am and what I want to talk about. It'll be hard for people to differentiate those different sides but I think it's possible. Once the music is out there, people will start to realize how serious I am about it rather than, 'Oh god, another actress making an album.'","I took guitar a while back, and my heart wasn't in it at the time, but I'm ready to try it again. I sing in the car, at home - it's a huge part of my life, especially since I'm from Tennessee.","When I dress up for events, I prefer Marc Jacobs and Dior. But I dream about wearing Chanel one day.","I've never really talked about this, but I would go days without eating. Or maybe I'd have some fruit and then go to the gym for three hours. I knew I had a problem... It was a gradual process but I changed myself.","I love Lady Antebellum and Miranda Lambert - they write from the heart. But it's hard to find a country music lover in L.A. None of my friends really listen to it, and they hate getting in the car with me because I just blast Taylor Swift.","I overanalyze things way too much, to the point where it affects my life. Like, when I'm talking to a boy, I'll overanalyze a text message he sent. And I have to think to myself, 'Just chill out. Some guy sent me a text message. That's all. Don't read something into it that's not there. Just be glad he sent you a text message!'","I hated school, but I was a good student. I made straight A's.","I was home schooled, so I never got a yearbook.","I hate flying. I don't like planes. I get really anxious.","I'm a really good juggler.","The music that I've had out so far was obviously very pop, but when I signed with Hollywood Records, I was like, 'I know that's the music you're familiar with, but that's not what I want to sing. I want to do country.' They were on board with it!","I love movies like '500 Days of Summer' and 'Juno.' Something offbeat without the glamour and the makeup and the clothing.","It's hard to come across a true country fan in L.A., but it's true that the fans are so loyal, once you're in their circle, you're in for your entire career. It just really speaks to me. Country music has so much soul and is so heartfelt. I think it's a perfect fit for me.","I'm from Tennessee. My mom lives in Nashville. I'm born and bred country. That's all I listen to.","I definitely love that all these car brands are coming out with hybrid forms of every car that they have. It's very awesome because I think it does make a difference, and it doesn't hurt that you save a lot of money on gas.","I'm overjoyed and honored to become a member of the Hollywood Records family. I've admired the careers they've made and can't wait to see how my musical path is paved out."],"Lucy Hawking":["I was never top of the class at school, but my classmates must have seen potential in me, because my nickname was Einstein.","I think the human race doesn't have a future if we don't go into space. We need to expand our horizons beyond planet Earth if we are to have a long-term future.","I never thought I would become amazing. I never thought I would be as great as my father. I would like to continue writing novels, and hopefully, at some point, I would like to make the switch from being 'Stephen Hawking's daughter' to 'novelist Lucy Hawking,' and that will be a fabulous day.","I am a world expert on how to organise tasks in a senseless order, totally unrelated to priority, and thus create a massive panic leading up to an important deadline.","I wonder whether being a scientist's daughter makes you so conflicted about free will and fate.","I'm not saying it never occurred to me to want to write a masterpiece, but I really doubt I could.","As a child, I wanted to know how things worked and to control them.","I wanted to be a ballerina as a child - I had a tutu, and I used to stage my own ballets in our front room with my family as the audience."],"Lucy Larcom":["If the world's a veil of tears, Smile till rainbows span it.","If the world seems cold to you, kindle fires to warm it.","What is the meaning of 'gossip?' Doesn't it originate with sympathy, an interest in one's neighbor, degenerating into idle curiosity and love of tattling? Which is worse, this habit, or keeping one's self so absorbed intellectually as to forget the sufferings and cares of others, to lose sympathy through having too much to think about?","No one can feel more gratefully the charm of noble scenery, or the refreshment of escape into the unspoiled solitudes of nature, than the laborer at some close in-door employment.","Our relatives form the natural setting of our childhood. We understand ourselves best and are best understood by others through the persons who came nearest to us in our earliest years.","Like a plant that starts up in showers and sunshine and does not know which has best helped it to grow, it is difficult to say whether the hard things or the pleasant things did me the most good.","It is one of the most beautiful facts in this human existence of ours, that we remember the earliest and freshest part of it most vividly. Doubtless it was meant that our childhood should live on in us forever.","A friend is a beloved mystery; dearest always because he is not ourself, and has something in him which it is impossible for us to fathom. If it were not so, friendship would lose its chief zest.","From the first opening of our eyes, it is the light that attracts us. We clutch aimlessly with our baby fingers at the gossamer-motes in the sunbeam, and we die reaching out after an ineffable blending of earthly and heavenly beauty which we shall never fully comprehend.","A journal of the 'subjective' kind I have always thought foolish, as nurturing a morbid self -consciousness in the writer; and yet, alone so much as I am, it is well to have some sort of a ventilator from the interior.","Labor, in itself, is neither elevating or otherwise. It is the laborer's privilege to ennoble his work by the aim with which he undertakes it, and by the enthusiasm and faithfulness he puts into it.","Every phase of our life belongs to us. The moon does not, except in appearance, lose her first thin, luminous curve, nor her silvery crescent, in rounding to her full. The woman is still both child and girl, in the completeness of womanly character.","A drop of water, if it could write out its own history, would explain the universe to us.","A complete autobiography would indeed be a picture of the outer and inner universe photographed upon one little life's consciousness. For does not the whole world, seen and unseen, go to the making up of every human being?","Girls especially are fond of exchanging confidences with those whom they think they can trust; it is one of the most charming traits of a simple, earnest-hearted girlhood, and they are the happiest women who never lose it entirely.","To different minds, poetry may present different phases. To me, the reverent faith of the people I lived among, and their faithful everyday living, was poetry; blossoms and trees and blue shies were poetry. God himself was poetry.","Religion is life inspired by Heavenly Love; and life is something fresh and cheerful and vigorous.","A man may make a misanthrope of himself, but he is never one by nature.","The curse of covetousness is that it destroys manhood by substituting money for character.","I defied the machinery to make me its slave. Its incessant discords could not drown the music of my thoughts if I would let them fly high enough.","We might all place ourselves in one of two ranks the women who do something, and the women who do nothing; the first being of course the only creditable place to occupy.","I am willing to make any part of my life public, if it will help others.","There is something in the place where we were born that holds us always by the heart-strings.","One mistake with beginners in writing is, that they think it important to spin out something long. It is a great deal better not to write more than a page or two, unless you have something to say, and can write it correctly.","The true idea of a church has not yet been shown the world, a visible Church, I mean, unless it was in the very earliest times; yes, the twelve disciples bound to their Lord in love, to do his work forever, that was a church, a Christian family.","God be thanked for the thinkers of good and noble thoughts! It wakes up all the best in ourselves, to come into close contact with others greater and better in every way than we are.","I remember how beautiful the Merrimac looked to me in childhood, the first true river I ever knew; it opened upon my sight and wound its way through my heart like a dream realized; its harebells, its rocks, and its rapids, are far more fixed in my memory than anything about the sea.","Whether rich or poor, a home is not a home unless the roots of love are ever striking deeper through the crust of the earthly and the conventional, into the very realities of being, not consciously always; seldom, perhaps; the simplicity of loving grows by living simply near nature and God.","When I heard that there were artists, I wished I could some time be one. If I could only make a rose bloom on paper, I thought I should be happy! Or if I could at last succeed in drawing the outline of winter-stripped boughs as I saw them against the sky, it seemed to me that I should be willing to spend years in trying.","Rich or poor, every child comes into the world with some imperative need of its own, which shapes its individuality.","The first real unhappiness I remember to have felt was when some one told me, one day, that I did not love God. I insisted, almost tearfully, that I did; but I was told that if I did truly love Him I should always be good. I knew I was not that, and the feeling of sudden orphanage came over me like a bewildering cloud.","Some of us must wait for the best human gifts until we come to heavenly places. Our natural desire for musical utterance is perhaps a prophecy that in a perfect world we shall all know how to sing.","The soul, cramped among the petty vexations of Earth, needs to keep its windows constantly open to the invigorating air of large and free ideas: and what thought is so grand as that of an ever-present God, in whom all that is vital in humanity breathes and grows?","Whatever science and philosophy may do for mankind, the world can never outgrow its need of the simplicity that is in Christ.","Everything in nature has its own intrinsic charm, as the work of its Creator's hand; but the chief beauty of the whole lies in its suggested relations to humanity. Things announce and wait for persons. The house would not have been thus beautifully built and furnished, except for an expected tenant.","Let us not depreciate Earth. There is no atom in it but is alive and astir in the all-penetrating splendor of God. From the infinitesimal to the infinite, everything is striving to express the thought of His Presence with which it overflows.","Whoever claims to understand another person completely, is either entirely ignorant of himself, or else has a nature so small that he can measure it easily, and supposes it to be the standard of every other nature.","We were not meant to mask ourselves before our fellow-beings, but to be, through our human forms, true and clear utterances of the spirit within. Since God gave us these bodies, they must have been given us as guides to Him and revealers of Him.","Few parents are aware of the difficulties that beset the minds of the little philosophers and theologians who sit upon their knees or play at their feet; and many a parent could not comprehend the disturbance, if he were aware of it."],"Lucy Lawless":["Treat everyone the same until you find out they're an idiot.","For the first time in my life, I put my body and reputation on the line to stand up for my beliefs and do the right thing. I hope I've encouraged other people to do the same.","I am waiting for a sign that will indicate to me what meaning I must give to my life, but right now my existence is satisfactory.","We live at the edge of the world, so we live on the edge. Kiwis will always sacrifice money and security for adventure and challenge.","We actually did quite a lot of comedy on 'Xena'. The whole show was very tongue-in-cheek.","I was black and blue for about two years, but it's paid off tremendously. You know, if you get enough whacks, your reflexes pick up, and I've become quite good - if somebody throws keys or something, I can catch them.","My plan is to shock people with what I can do, because I've got a few sides to me that I've never used on screen.","I get to do all these really nice, little culty things. It seems to be the world that keeps inviting me back."],"Lucy Liu":["Once you embody the language, the character comes really naturally, especially when you put the costume on.","Women who wear kimonos, when the fight, they have to keep their knees together, and when they use a sword, they have to move the sleeves otherwise it gets caught.","You can't look back; you have to keep looking forward.","I think you just have to appreciate who you are and hopefully they can see what a superhero is about.","You have to look out for becoming trapped in a place where people want to see you all the time doing one thing.","They were concerned about the racial issue. They thought it was not a safe issue to go Asian, unfortunately.","It's like kill or be killed, that's my thing basically.","Being Asian in this business is something you have to consider, because sometimes people aren't as open. They'll say, I can't see you with a Caucasian person.","I always admired Wonder Woman and the Incredible Hulk - but I don't know if I'd be a very convincing hulk.","It's so much fun playing Ling, but I have this fear that people are going to run away from me in terror on the streets. They think I'm going to bite their heads off or something.","Everything I buy is vintage and smells funny. Maybe that's why I don't have a boyfriend.","You respect all of these people that you know in the business as actors. And they sort of turn around and say, we really like your work. It's a nice acknowledgment.","Working on the Samurai sword is very different because your body position has to be very still. It's a much quieter was of fighting.","Women like to watch women fight because it makes them feel sort of empowered physically and mentally. They feel kind of jazzed and excited by it.","When you work with chains or any kind of weapons, or just when you're using hand-to-hand combat, you are going to get hurt.","The neck is kind of what's sexy in Japan, so you have to have the kimono a little bit back. It was just a whole different way of appealing to what was sexy.","Since we didn't use guns, we wanted to make sure we could earn the ability to win the audience over by making it believable. A lot of what you do when you work out in that mode is use your mental energy.","People use location as a language in films, and Quentin uses action as a language in his films. There's really not a lot of violence. It's more of an emotional beat than it is a physical beat.","Nobody really tells me what's going on, and I find out via the trades myself.","Men, when they fight in movies, it's a very different style. Harrison Ford was so cool when he had the whip, and Bruce Lee was such an artist that you couldn't take your eyes off of him.","Japanimation is a whole different art form.","If you see the Sopranos, you're not going to be speaking in the Shakespearean English.","I've never really thought about competing with cartoons.

Life would be a sorry business without them. With them it's grand and great.","That is one good thing about this world... there are always sure to be more springs.","In this world you've just got to hope for the best and prepare for the worst and take whatever God sends.","It's so easy to be wicked without knowing it, isn't it?","Proverbs are all very fine when there's nothing to worry you, but when you're in real trouble, they're not a bit of help.","It only seems as if you're doing something when you worry.","I'm not a bit changed - not really.

The real me - back here - is just the same.","There are so many unpleasant things in the world already that there is no use in imagining any more."],"Lucy Peng":["Consumers expect a safe, convenient, and affordable globalised payment platform.","Online payment will continue to play an ever-growing and significant role in the development of e-commerce as well as the stimulation of consumer demand."],"Lucy Powell":["Both the velodrome and the Commonwealth swimming pool are open to the public and are frequently used by local schools and the local community. Over the last six years young people have been inspired to take up swimming and cycling more seriously; some of them are now coming through as Olympic champions or hopefuls.","In the industrial revolution Britain led the world in advances that enabled mass production: trade exchanges, transportation, factory technology and new skills needed for the new industrialised world.","Over the last 10 years a huge amount has been achieved in getting people into work. Measures such as the New Deal, tax credits, the minimum wage and improved childcare have brought about record numbers of people in work, a number that is still rising despite the global economic slowdown.","The cost of motoring is a massive issue at the moment, there's no question. The price of petrol goes up every time you go to the petrol station.","Today the demands are for even higher standards in the quality of care, for greater flexibility and convenience in treatment times, and for more prevention through screening and health checks.","I have run a general election campaign pregnant and ran Ed Miliband's leadership campaign commuting to London with a new baby so I already have my system set up.","The impact of the downturn is starting to feel very real. House prices and the housing market have been taking the knock for some time and that's affecting people.","The Tories and the Lib Dems talk about social mobility, but, short of winning the lottery, the only way to guarantee young people from all backgrounds the opportunity to do better and to raise aspirations is through education.","Funding for sports (and the arts) are often the first things facing the chop in difficult times.","At its most basic the democratic contract is a simple one: the right to vote comes with a responsibility to society, through tax payments and citizenship.","Events are moving so fast and what in one moment seems impossible, the next is happening. I'm sure historians will, in time, provide theories and analysis, but for now I think most of us simply want the tide stemmed.","Connecting people to jobs and to each other is absolutely vital to a city's economy (and to the wider economy).","These are tough times and under this Tory-led government many people in Manchester are suffering and getting left behind. If elected I will use all my energy, skills, experience and knowledge to stand up for our communities and get things done for the better.","The Labour party has done more than any other to address gender inequalities, through legislation and other means, and to increase women's representation in politics, which has led to recent increases in the number of female politicians.","In these difficult times, when tough decisions are required, the differences between Labour and the Tories are becoming much clearer. One party believes in intervention to reduce social and economic costs and the other believes in market forces and letting things take their course.","I will take a short time out from being in Parliament when the baby is born but I'll still be doing my constituency work - just with another baby in tow.","I'm honoured to have been selected to be the Labour candidate for Manchester Central.","Doing nothing and shrinking spending may save us public money in the short term but could cost us a great deal more over time as the recession takes hold for much longer.","Surely, the best and most effective measure is to get the economy moving and shorten the period of recession or slowdown. That's the rationale for Gordon Brown's 'fiscal stimulus' and it sounds like a good one to me.","The Tories seem unable to make any impact north of the border.","As the prospect of a Tory government gets nearer, many traditional Labour voters - some who switched away in recent times and many who stayed at home - seem more determined to prevent that happening.","The choice between a Labour government and a Tory one is sharpening minds.","In Scotland, the indication is that for the Westminster elections at least, Labour voters are satisfied with their government.","As the economy faces such difficulties, more tough questions need to be asked about what the Tories would do if elected. Their ideology of free markets and small government needs challenging. That has to be part of our job.","Some argue that now isn't the time to push the green agenda - that all efforts should be on preventing a serious recession. That is a false choice. It fails to recognise that climate change and our carbon reliance is part of problem - high fuel prices and food shortages due to poor crop yields compound today's financial difficulties.","A global deal will only be possible if Britain plays its part, leading the way with other developed countries.","It's not a matter of if economies around the world becoming low-carbon, but when and how: through struggle and strife or through advancement and progressive leadership. Larry Elliot described it today as the 'Green New Deal.' It's a leadership we in Britain can provide, and from which our economy can benefit.","The lack of available credit and loans is having a severe impact on small businesses in particular, but also their suppliers and the bigger companies too.","There's a loss of faith in the banking system that for so long has been the backbone of prosperity and growth.","People rightly want our political leaders - on all sides - to concentrate on minimising the damage to jobs, living standards and our savings from the banking crisis.","It's estimated that by 2030 there will be virtually no unskilled jobs in the British economy.","The era of industrial Britain, where a large section of our workforce provided cheap labour in factories and processing goods, is over.","Globalisation means that for a high-wage, developed economy like Britain's to compete we need to focus our efforts on the highly skilled, added-value sectors such as advanced manufacturing, creative industries, engineering and even financial services.","In politics, the number of women in the cabinet has fallen and, if current poll trends continue and Labour loses a number of marginal seats, the number of female MPs is likely to drop significantly.","As a relatively young woman - I'm 33 - I hope to one day have a family and already have commitments. If and when I'm elected as an MP, I would face a choice: take my family with me to London each week or be apart for four, maybe five, nights a week.","Team GB's success at the Beijing Olympics can, in part, be said to have been made in Manchester. For example, all the cycling medal winners trained at Manchester's velodrome, the National Cycling Centre.","Even though I support the blue side of Manchester's football heritage, I don't really mind that wherever I go in the world it's not Manchester City that starts the conversation. 'Ah, yes, Manchester United,' is the response when I say where I come from. It's commonplace everywhere - in Europe, Africa, Asia and even the U.S.","You're wrong if you think young people don't deserve the vote.","Sixteen- and 17-year-olds pay taxes and can join the army, so surely they should in turn be given their right to vote.","For sure, the 'Obamania' that's fast taking hold reflects an incredible thirst for change in global politics and, dare I say, a wave of optimism that things can be different.","Like many of my friends and colleagues, I can't get enough of Obama news; latest polling, speeches, visits, reaction of world leaders.","We in the Labour party owe it to the people we represent to make sure that we offer a choice at the next election between our Labour values and those of the Conservatives.","We need to dig deep and give people a reason to be optimistic just as Obama is doing in America. Because in the same way that outcome of the U.S. elections will change the course of events there and around the world, so too do politics here in Britain.","In the current climate motorists have a long list of issues from which to choose to raise on the doorstep. Policies aimed at reducing emissions - like the changes to Vehicle Excise Duty or here in Manchester the proposals for congestion charges - are not without controversy.","Being out and about talking to residents and representing their views is, in my view, as important to politics as the grandstanding that takes place in Westminster.","It's become unfashionable to celebrate political achievement, and Labour achievement even less so. And it's positively uncouth to be proud of something that this Labour government is doing. So, slam me for saying so, but I'm really proud of the NHS.","Fossil fuels, including oil, are running out and supplies are getting harder to find. If we do nothing, prices will continue to rise and our reliance on oil will come to an abrupt and tumultuous end, causing global economic and social turmoil.","At times unpopular measures are needed in order to change behaviour.","For us political activists and candidates, the morning after any election is a mix of emotions - the personal and the immediate, the culmination of your own recent campaigning efforts; and the fortunes of your party and the success or otherwise of what you stand for and believe in.","The economic and social decline of Zimbabwe is shocking and appalling. Life there is unrecognisable from that of the recent past. Each day is a struggle for basic survival.","I just hope that the democratic will of the Zimbabwean people prevails. If it does we must move quickly to help restore stability and prosperity.","In last year's local elections in Manchester a third of those who voted did so by post. It's not just that people are choosing to get postal votes, but having one makes it much more likely that they'll vote.","Indeed, when all parties campaign effectively the overall effect is to push up voting rates, as you see in tight marginal seats or close general elections. That must be good for democracy.","Over the last 15 years or so, Manchester has undergone huge transformation - from a city in decline and on its knees to one that is growing, vibrant and confident.","People in south Manchester overwhelming want to be able to recycle more than they currently can - especially cardboard and plastics - and want more frequent and accessible collections, particularly for those living in flats.","I wish that Iraq had not happened - and that we had not lost touch with so many of our natural supporters. But this should have provided an opportunity for the Liberal Democrats as a party. Yet their protest gains are now diminishing.","What the Lib Dems have failed to do is offer any meaningful agenda for government or for power.","We in the Labour party know better than most that opposition is the easy part. What's more difficult is governing and setting out an agenda for government.","In an era when party fundraising is badly tainted, dinners are a really good way of raising cash for campaigning. Lots of people giving very small amounts of money through ticket sales and raffle prizes: yes, it's much harder work than big donations, but I think it's a more democratic and transparent way of fundraising.","Although my seat is a contest between Labour and the Lib Dems, it could well make the difference between a Labour and a Tory government at the next election. In terms of international development, this choice is a very clear one."],"Lucy Punch":["I am terrified of being misjudged by thousands of faceless Twitterers.","People ask why I always play crazy people and free spirits. I guess it is because I like to have fun. But I am more ambitious than your average free spirit. This job is hard enough that, without drive and hard work, you will never make it work.","That's nice, to be compared to Joanna Lumley. She played my mother once in 'Ella Enchanted.' I was one of the ugly sisters, and she was the stepmother, so that was great. I'll take that comparison, thank you.","I had a very nice, cozy childhood. I did lots of plays at school and worked with the National Youth Theatre as a teenager.","I always find it funny when I watch actors talking about, 'I chose to do this part.' A lot of times it's 'you're lucky to get the job.' We're like, 'Thank you so much.'","I'm a really good dinner party guest. I am always so appreciative, impressed that anyone has even managed to turn on the oven and cook for me.","I tend to eat geographically. When I'm in L.A., I like to eat L.A. food.","When I was 11, I had an Ugly Sister birthday party. All my idea. Most girls want to be a fairy or a princess, but there I am with beauty spots and fur and fluorescent pink kiss-curls.","Someone told me I had funny facial expressions. I don't know whether I take that as a compliment or not, but.","I did buy 'The Sun' a few times, but I just don't read the tabloids. Sometimes they can have genius witty headlines, but that's all. There's nothing to read.","I personally do not find puke funny. I find it disgusting.","I never feel comfortable! I'm always anxious. I'm always all over the board. That said, I like doing comedy because it's easy to tell when you're getting it right because people laugh, and you can hear it, and they're smiling, and you can see it.","Trying to look cool and lovely in comedy is a recipe for disaster. You have to let go.","If you can make people laugh, you know you're getting it right; it's an instant pat on the back.","My mother loved Gene Wilder when I was growing up, so I used to watch all his movies with her. I just adore him.","What I like in L.A. is that it's a lot more brutal. In England it's, 'Have a cup of tea, have a chat,' and you still don't get the part. In L.A. you go in, do your bit, and if they don't like you, you're straight out again. In a sense, that's more honest.","I'm not ashamed to look like a total idiot.","I'm sure my agents would like me to play leading roles, and I guess I should, but I'm more interested in the character parts. They're more fun, challenging and interesting.","The actors I admire, like Ben Kingsley or Daniel Day-Lewis, they totally reinvent themselves in every part. I hope I get a chance to do that.","Steve Carell is the most spectacular ad-lib improviser ever. And just doing a scene with him, it's just one incredible topping himself on every take.","I love the Midwest accent.","To be honest, and I may regret saying this, the idea of playing the same character for a very long time is very daunting to me.","I feel very lucky that I make a living doing what I always wanted to do.","I am very chaotic; I am always late and walking into things.","My friends asked me to be a reverend at their wedding in France a few years ago. I went on the Internet, and within 15 seconds, I was printing out a certificate which allowed me to officiate at their wedding.","I can see why people love the idea of a big white wedding - it is a day when they are the centre of attention and get to wear a beautiful dress. But that sounds awful to me because that is like getting ready to walk down the red carpet.","Every movie I've done, when they cast me, they knew I'd probably do it for a toffee apple and a Frappuccino.","I won't eat offal. Once, I was in London at the Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons, which is this really fancy eating establishment and hotel, and I almost got conned into eating testicles. It was one of the most delicious meals I've ever eaten, about twelve courses. That was one of the courses.","I was very chatty and talkative and always getting sent out of class for talking too much and not paying attention, passing notes.","When I was 17 I interned at a school, and it was the most exhausting, difficult thing I've ever done, with all these screaming children.","What I love about L.A. is that people say they're going for a hike, which just means a walk. It's a stroll, but if you walk in L.A., it's a hike.","As long as it's funny, there's no such thing as too far.","I remember I had a boyfriend a long time ago who said, 'You need to change your name; you sound like a circus performer.'","When I was younger, I was nervous and didn't have a huge amount of confidence as an actor. Comedy is something - you know when you're getting it right because you can hear. And you can hear if you're not getting it right! I like to create interesting, weird characters, and they're often best in comedies.","I always played the ugly sister instead of Cinderella or the Wicked Witch. But those are the parts I love, and actually, to be a character actress, you have more longevity, hopefully."],"Lucy Stone":["I think, with never-ending gratitude, that the young women of today do not and can never know at what price their right to free speech and to speak at all in public has been earned.","Now all we need is to continue to speak the truth fearlessly, and we shall add to our number those who will turn the scale to the side of equal and full justice in all things.","The idea of equal rights was in the air.","Leave women to find their sphere.","I expect to plead not for the slave only, but for suffering humanity everywhere. Especially do I mean to labor for the elevation of my sex.","I know not what you believe of God, but I believe He gave yearnings and longings to be filled, and that He did not mean all our time should be devoted to feeding and clothing the body.","A wife should no more take her husband's name than he should hers. My name is my identity and must not be lost.","If a woman earned a dollar by scrubbing, her husband had a right to take the dollar and go and get drunk with it and beat her afterwards. It was his dollar.","But I do believe that a woman's truest place is in a home, with a husband and with children, and with large freedom, pecuniary freedom, personal freedom, and the right to vote.","To make the public sentiment, on the side of all that is just and true and noble, is the highest use of life.","Henceforth the leaves of the tree of knowledge were for women, and for the healing of the nations."],"Lucy Walker":["I'm riveted by extreme sports like big-wave surfing, 'megaramp' skateboarding and half-pipe snowboarding. I'm fascinated partly because the sports are so exhilaratingly acrobatic. But I'm also captivated by the fear that a terrible accident might happen at any moment. And accidents do happen.","Extreme sports tricks are becoming increasingly complex, the courses ever more challenging and crashes all too common.","The world of extreme sports is also one of big business. Kids might think that snowboarding is the ultimate freedom, but this freedom is being marketed to them by commercial sponsors.","I remember when the Berlin Wall fell and suddenly intractable problems get solved.","My main trick is to work with amazing people. It's a long and twisty journey, and you need people that really are amazing and have this rare gift of honesty and courage and really open up.","With portable cameras and affordable data and non-linear digital editing, I think this is a golden age of documentary filmmaking. These new technologies mean we can make complicated, beautifully crafted and cinematic films about real-life stories.","I am so picky about what films I get myself into because it's such an explosion of energy and commitment once you get in there, you destroy your life until you deliver these films. I never want to be in the position of making films that won't be a great use of 90 minutes of someone's life.","There are still people who have an issue working with a woman director. Women can be viewed as 'difficult' even though they work in the same way as men.","I think we have become oversaturated with tired fictional narratives.","I've always been a fiction filmmaker and I've been heading in the direction of fiction filmmaking, doing documentaries along the way.","I love my work, apart from when it's driving me crazy. But I get to be interested in stuff and think like a filmmaker as I'm buzzing about the world and then see an opportunity to make a film, and then make it happen.","I find titles the hardest thing. I was worried that 'Waste Land' was too much of a downer. For me, 'The Crash Reel' confronts what the film is about: it's not just about the reality of a crash, it's about the extremity we all face, and what happens when life crashes on you.","I love great locations in movies, and I couldn't believe I'd never seen a landfill on screen before. It was the most haunting place.","I have always been interested in garbage: What it says about us. What in there embarrasses us, and what we can't bear to part with. Where it goes and how much of it there is. How it endures. What it might be like to work with it every day.","I don't believe in objectivity. I observe the observer's paradox every moment I'm filming. Your presence is changing everything; there's no mistaking it. And you have a responsibility.","I can't help seeing 'Waste Land' as the third in a triptych with my earlier films 'Devil's Playground' and 'Blindsight,' and not least in the awe and gratitude I feel for the group of people who were courageous enough to share their stories with us - and to live lives so rich in inspiration for us all.","I love making fiction films as well as nonfiction ones, and hope to keep challenging myself to make better and better work.","Some documentaries are made by people who are driven more by one particular story, or have different backgrounds or ambitions, but I'm always looking for projects that let me be the best filmmaker I can be, and to be stretched and grow further.","The world needs more women filmmakers, so we have to keep encouraging ourselves and one another, and eventually things must get easier for us.","I don't know if people realize how hard I work, because sometimes people ask me for my secret. The truth is that I don't have any secrets apart from the fact that I've been directing theater and film for twenty years and trying at every stage to make my work better."],"Ludacris":["My work is like my vacation, so in a way every day is like Saturday.","I find myself eating different kinds of chicken each and every day, even if it's by surprise.","I love everything from old-school cars to whatever the latest muscle or luxury vehicles are.","I've always had an affinity and a passion for cars and that whole car culture.","I love technology. We can be our own DJs wherever we go.","I've never been a cocky individual, but I am very confident.","I'm a perfectionist, so I always feel there's room for improvement.","Your fans, they count on you to make wise decisions and wise choices. That's why they're your fan base. If you continually let them down, they're going to go find someone else to be fans of.","I used to be a video game freak, but I've kind of like eased back.","I'm just basically spillin' out my emotions to the world. 'Cause rap is about emotion. And I want you to feel what I'm feelin', 'cause that's what it's all about.","The hip-hop community is made up of a lot of hustlers. Everybody is trying to get theirs, and everybody is trying to eat.","I'm ridiculous, I'm ludicrous.","I'm one of those people that just likes to be comfortable.","I'm a part of the no-tight-jeans coalition.","But it's a blessing to be so successful within a year; it's the greatest feeling in the world, making money and doing the things that I'm doing, and I definitely trying to continue doing what I'm doing.","I made my first complete song when I was 9.","I'm always in that mode - whenever I have a little free time, I'm always recording songs, writing, whatever I gotta do. It's like my job is my vacation.","I feel like we need more aggression today.","Anytime I shoot a video, I just think of anything I can do to set myself apart from everybody in the music industry.","I made my first song when I was 9 years old. Just beating on garbage cans, having people beat box.","'Ludacris' is something that I made up. It just kind of describes me. Sometimes I have like a split personality. Sometimes I'm cool, calm, and collected, and other times I'm beyond crazy.","I've been trying to nail it into everyone's heads that I feel like I am the most versatile rapper.","I don't want to be too over-exposed, but then at the same time I don't want to be too out-of-sight-out-of-mind.","No matter how much money I ever get, I'm going to want to provide for my family and never have to go back to really struggling. You don't ever want to go outside, you don't ever want to be left in the cold. You want to be safe.","Of course I have bills to pay, but at the same time, it's more about the passion and the love, and I think that's where music should come from, the heart, not necessarily just to cash a check.","It don't take a lot to make me happy. I'm not spoiled like that.","Working through experience is best for me, just being there and trying to get into the mode.","I think half the battle is just being comfortable in front of the camera - and I already am, doing so many videos and interviews, so then it just takes that extra step of trying to get into character.","I'm going to continue to keep music number one.","I think every album you have to stretch further and further, give people another piece of you. But then I always try to deviate from the norm.","I really love when people come up to me on the street and say, 'You're my favorite rapper.'","I'm trying to be number one all the way around. It's not just the South, it's not just the East, it's not the West, I'm going for across the world, you know what I'm saying? This is where I'm coming from.","A lot of beefs in the music industry are caused from miscommunication and just not really understanding what's going on, having people in your ear saying this is what somebody did, or this is what somebody did to you.","You don't have that many women in the industry so the lane is wide open.","It's a lot of crooked cops out there. They manipulate the system."],"Ludi Lin":["You see all these movies of white men saving the world all the time.","I am Chinese. I speak fluent Mandarin. And I go, 'Man, it's about time a Chinese person could step up to a Hollywood screen, and international screen, and help save the world.'"],"Ludivine Sagnier":["In 'Swimming Pool,' all the colors are very warm, sunny, the pool and all that. In 'Love Crime,' everything is so cold, and it's all inside skyscrapers.","'Swimming Pool' was a very important moment for me because the character was written for me.","Being a mum makes you more aware of how short life is and how important it is to enjoy every minute because you have less time for yourself. A day doesn't have 24 hours any more - it only lasts 10, or eight. So you learn to get rid of all the parasites. I'm not talking about people, but things that could be toxic for happiness.","It's funny because I remember when I came to the U.S. with 'Swimming Pool,' the movie did well, and it was great box office for a French movie, but I remember I was a bit upset because all people talked to me about was the nudity.","When I was in the U.S. for 'Swimming Pool,' people had asked me, 'So are you going to settle down in Hollywood?' And I said, 'No, I'm French! I am living in France. I am not going to be American.'","When I was in my 20s, I thought that being known for 'Swimming Pool' was kind of a burden. Like, 'OK, everyone thinks I am this tanned bimbo,' and I was having problems coping with that image.","I don't act to be popular or see my face on the cover of magazines every time I go out to get coffee. I don't want to think about me all the time and what I look like.","I'd say people recognize me, but having children recognize me is the best. It is a very special thing. Suddenly you feel like you have the power to make the children's dreams come true, and it's better than anything else.","It's impossible to explain to people who you are in a five-minute interview on TV.","Hollywood is a wonderful machine for making big movies. In France, we make smaller and more personal films, but if things keep changing, this will disappear. The industry in Italy is practically gone. Cinecitta now is used mostly by filmmakers from others places, like Martin Scorsese.","When you get quick fame and success and exposure, it makes you feel dizzy, and I didn't want to lose my balance 'cause that's something I've been struggling with for so many years. I'm not fond of the idea of making it in Hollywood. That's not my aim; otherwise, I would have settled down in Los Angeles.","What I'm looking for is the variety of choices and the opportunity to work with great directors - that's what I'm looking for.","In modelling or football, being 30 is very bad. But, for an actress, ageing is like wine. You taste better and better because your body, your mind, your feelings, all this is a tool and it's getting sharper with time.","I would like to perform more in English. But there have to be many good things gathered for me to be willing to do a movie. I watch trailers of every new American movie and I'm, like, 'OK, I'm not missing anything!'","You know, the character of Isabelle in 'Love Crime' is the only character I feel the furthest from. I have nothing to share with her, so it was really difficult. Being an actor of composition is something, but you always base yourself on something you know about.","It's funny how human beings are so entertained by crimes.","To me, the director is the most important, rather than the story.","Having a movie that lasts and makes your image imprinted into the history of cinema, it's very positive.","I really have problems with horror movies. I don't watch them. It's a feeling I don't want to have in cinema. I'm too reactive. It's too draining to watch that kind of movie.","Good characters are rare. As long as I find one or two a year, I'm happy.","You know, when you start, especially with me, I didn't really know I was going to be a movie actress. I thought I was going to do theater."],"Ludovic Halevy":["In order to make money the first thing is to have no need of it.","No news is good news."],"Ludovico Ariosto":["From heresy, frenzy and jealousy, good Lord deliver me.","Such fire was not by water to be drowned, nor he his nature changed by changing ground.","Nature made him, and then broke the mold.","They think they have God Almighty by the toe.","We soon believe the things we would believe.","Who seems most hideous when adorned the most.","When the devil grows old he turns hermit.","Man proposes, and God disposes."],"Ludwig Bemelmans":["To be a gourmet you must start early, as you must begin riding early to be a good horseman. You must live in France, your father must have been a gourmet. Nothing in life must interest you but your stomach.","The true gourmet, like the true artist, is one of the unhappiest creatures existent. His trouble comes from so seldom finding what he constantly seeks: perfection.","I don't keep any copy of my books around... they would embarass me. When I finish writing my books, I kick them in the belly, and have done with them.","Caviar is to dining what a sable coat is to a girl in evening dress."],"Ludwig Borne":["Getting rid of a delusion makes us wiser than getting hold of a truth.","Goodwill is the one and only asset that competition cannot undersell or destroy.","Losing an illusion makes you wiser than finding a truth.","If one age believes too much it is natural that another believes too little.","The difference between Liberty and liberties is as great as God and gods."],"Ludwig Erhard":["A compromise is the art of dividing a cake in such a way that everyone believes he has the biggest piece.","Without Britain, Europe would remain only a torso."],"Ludwig Mies van der Rohe":["It is not possible to go forward while looking back.","Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space.","Architecture begins when you place two bricks carefully together.","A chair is a very difficult object. A skyscraper is almost easier. That is why Chippendale is famous.","Architecture is always the will of the age conceived as space - nothing else. Until this simple truth is clearly recognized, the struggle over the foundation of a new architecture confident in its aims and powerful in its impact cannot be realized; until then, it is destined to remain a chaos of uncoordinated forces.","Less is more.","Architecture starts when you carefully put two bricks together. There it begins.","It is not architectural achievement that makes the structures of earlier times seem to us so full of significance but the circumstance that antique temples, Roman basilicas, and even the cathedrals of the Middle Ages are not the works of single personalities but creations of entire epochs.","True education is concerned not only with practical goals but also with values. Our aims assure us of our material life, our values make possible our spiritual life.","Where can we find greater structural clarity than in the wooden buildings of old? Where else can we find such unity of material, construction and form? here, the wisdom of whole generations is stored.","Architecture depends on its time. It is the crystallization of its inner structure, the slow unfolding of its form.","If one limits to developing only the kitchen and bathroom as standardized rooms because of their installation, and then also decides to arrange the remaining living area with movable walls, I believe that any justified living requirements can be met.","Nothing can express the aim and meaning of our work better than the profound words of St. Augustine - 'Beauty is the splendor of Truth.'","I especially remember that on All Souls Day, when so many people wanted new monuments for the graves, our whole family pitched in. I did the lettering on the stones, my brother did the carving, and my sisters put the finishing touches on them, the gold leaf and all that.","I thought a lot and I controlled my thoughts in my work - and I controlled my work through my thoughts.","God is in the details.","Each material has its specific characteristics which we must understand if we want to use it. This is no less true of steel and concrete.","Reinforced concrete buildings are by nature skeletal buildings. No noodles nor armoured turrets. A construction of girders that carry the weight, and walls that carry no weight. That is to say, buildings consisting of skin and bones.","What finally is beauty? Certainly nothing that can be calculated or measured. It is always something imponderable, something that lies between things.","We should attempt to bring nature, houses, and human beings together in a higher unity.","Education must lead us from the irresponsible opinion to true responsible judgment. It must lead us from chance and arbitrariness to rational clarity and intellectual order. Therefore, let us guide our students over the road of discipline from materials, through function, to creative work.","When one looks at Nature through the glass walls of the Farnsworth House, it takes on a deeper significance than when one stands outside. More of Nature is thus expressed - it becomes part of a greater whole.","We refuse to recognize problems of form, but only problems of building. Form is not the aim of our work, but only the result. Form, by itself, does not exist. Form as an aim is formalism; and that we reject.","Nature, too, shall live its own life. We must beware not to disrupt it with the color of our houses and interior fittings. yet we should not attempt to bring nature, houses, and human beings together into a higher unity.","I don't want to be interesting. I want to be good.","The building art is man's spatial dialogue with his environment and demonstrates how he asserts himself therein and how he masters it.","I see in industrialization the central problem of building in our time. If we succeed in carrying out this industrialization, the social, economic, technical, and also artistic problems will be readily solved.","Not yesterday, not tomorrow, only today can be given form. Only this architecture creates.","It is much better to have just one idea, and if the idea is clear, then you can fight for it. That is how you can get things done.","The idea of service leads to community.","Wherever technology reaches its real fulfillment, it transcends into architecture.","Form as a goal always ends in formalism. For this striving is directed not towards an inside, but towards an outside. But only a living inside has a living outside.","Simply by not owning three medium-sized castles in Tuscany I have saved enough money in the last forty years on insurance premiums alone to buy a medium-sized castle in Tuscany.","Never talk to a client about architecture. Talk to him about his children. That is simply good politics. he will not understand what you have to say about architecture most of the time.","Create form out of the nature of the task with the means of our time. This is our work.","Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space. Living, Changing, New. Not yesterday, not tomorrow, only today can be given form. Only such architecture is creative.","Industrialization of the building trade is a question of material. Hence the demand for a new building material is the first prerequisite.","Just as we acquaint ourselves with materials, and just as we must understand functions, we must become familiar with the psychological and spiritual factors of the day. No cultural activity is possible otherwise, for we are dependent on the spirit of our time.","Generally, I think my work has so much influence because of its reasonableness.","We have to know that life cannot be changed by us. It will be changed. But not by us. We can only guide the things that can cause physical change.","You cannot save wonderful towns. You can only save wonderful towns by building new ones.","The tendency of our time is wholly oriented toward the secular. The efforts of the mystics will remain episodes. Despite a deepening of our conceptions of life, we will build no cathedrals.","The building art is, in reality, always the spatial execution of spiritual decisions. It is bound to its times and manifests itself only in addressing vital tasks with the means of its times. A knowledge of the times, its tasks, and its means is the necessary precondition of work in the building art.","I hope you will understand that architecture has nothing to do with the inventions of forms. It is not a playground for children, young or old. Architecture is the real battleground of the spirit.","I do not think it is an advantage to build planned packaged houses. If you prefabricate a house completely, it becomes an unnecessary restriction.","What would life be like if everybody insisted you must have actually built such-and-such a thing by yourself? I'd be an old man and have nothing to show for the aging.","It must be possible to solve the task of controlling nature and yet simultaneously create a new freedom.","Architecture depends on facts, but its real field of activity lies in the realm of the significance.","Every How is carried by a What.","It is a hopeless endeavor to make the form and content of earlier architectural epochs usable for our time; in this, even the strongest artistic talent must fail. We see repeatedly how the outstanding builders fail to achieve an effect because their work does not serve the will of the age.","The demands of the time for objectivity and functionality must be fulfilled. If that clearly happens, then the buildings of our day will convey the greatness of which the age is capable, and only a fool will maintain that they lack it.","We must understand the motives and forces of our time and analyze their structure from three points of view: the material, the functional, and the spiritual. We must make clear in what respects our epoch differs from others and in what respects it is similar.","We do not evaluate the result but the starting point of the creative process. Precisely, this shows whether the form was discovered by starting from life, or for its own sake. That is why I consider the creative process so essential. Life for us is the decisive factor.","1926 was the most significant year. Looking back, it seems that it was not just a year in the sense of time. It was a year of great realisation or awareness. It seems to me that at certain times of the history of man, the understanding of certain situations ripens.","Our utilitarian structures will mature into architecture only when, through their fulfillment of function, they become carriers of the will of the age.","You can use up all the slums for new development. In all the cities of the world, there are large areas of these. Also, you can avoid the spread of these silly suburban houses. Chicago has thousands of them all over the place.","I really don't know the Chicago School. You see, I never walk. I always take taxis back and forth to work. I rarely see the city.","Means must be subsidiary to ends and to our desire for dignity and value.","I think that an industrial process is not like a rubber stamp. Everything has to be put together and, as such, should have its own expression.","Most of our designs are developed long before there is a practical possibility of carrying them out. I do that on purpose and have done it all my life. I do it when I am interested in something.","It took me a long time to understand the relationship between ideas and between objective facts. But after I clearly understood this relationship, I didn't fool around with other wild ideas. That is one of the main reasons why I just make my scheme as simple as possible.","It is no use working with other architects. What can they do? Who does what?","Cheese was the staple. Bread you brought from home. The Schnaps came later. At the end of the week when people got paid, that's when you got your Schnaps, lots of it, five Pfennige a shot.","We made drawings the size of a whole quarter of a room ceiling, which we would then send on to the model makers. I did this every day for two years. Even now I can draw cartouches with my eyes closed.","You can teach students how to work; you can teach them technique - how to use reason; you can even give them a sense of proportions - of order. You can teach them general principles.","The problem of architecture has always been the same throughout time. Its authentic quality is reached through its proportions, and the proportions cost nothing. In fact, most of them are proportions among things, not the things themselves. Art is almost always a question of proportions.","Behrens had a great sense of the great form. that was his main interest; and that I certainly understood and learned from him.","The architect must get to know the people who will live in the planned house. From their needs, the rest inevitably follows.","In addition to the wishes of the client, the position, orientation, and size of the plot also play an important role in determining the final plan of the house. The 'where' and 'how' of the exterior then follows naturally from all of that.","After my time in Holland, an inner battle ensued in which I tried to free myself from the influence of Schinkelesque classicism.","Modern buildings of our time are so huge that one must group them. Often the space between these buildings is as important as the buildings themselves.","If there really is no new way to be found, we are not afraid to stick with the old one that we found previously. So, I do not make every building different.","When it becomes economically possible, building will become montage.","I discovered by working with actual glass models that the important thing is the play of reflections and not the effect of light and shadow, as in ordinary buildings.","In 1912, when I was working in The Hague, I first saw a drawing by Louis Sullivan of one of his buildings. It interested me.","Technology is rooted in the past. It dominates the present and tends into the future. It is a real historical movement - one of the great movements which shape and represent their epoch.","Technology is far more than a method, it is a world in itself. As a method, it is superior in almost every respect. But only where it is left to itself, as in gigantic structures of engineering, there technology reveals its true nature.","I do not oppose form, but only form as a goal."],"Ludwig Quidde":["Let us assume that the ideal were reached; let us imagine a state of international life in which the danger of war no longer exists. Then no one would dare to demand a penny for obviously completely superfluous armaments.","The relationship of the two problems is rather the reverse. To a great extent disarmament is dependent on guarantees of peace. Security comes first and disarmament second.","Great progress was made when arbitration treaties were concluded in which the contracting powers pledge in advance to submit all conflicts to an arbitration court, treaties which not only specify the composition of the court, but also its procedure.","Even a total and universal disarmament does not guarantee the maintenance of peace.","Thus, if armaments were curtailed without a secure peace and all countries disarmed proportionately, military security would have been in no way affected.","The present level of armaments could be taken as the starting point. It could be stipulated in an international treaty that these armaments should be simultaneously and uniformly reduced by a certain proportion in all countries.","The popular, and one may say naive, idea is that peace can be secured by disarmament and that disarmament must therefore precede the attainment of absolute security and lasting peace.","Lightly armed nations can move toward war just as easily as those which are armed to the teeth, and they will do so if the usual causes of war are not removed.","When distrust exists between governments, when there is a danger of war, they will not be willing to disarm even when logic indicates that disarmament would not affect military security at all.","Every success in limiting armaments is a sign that the will to achieve mutual understanding exists, and every such success thus supports the fight for international law and order.","We pacifists have not ceased to point to the grave danger of armaments and to insist on their curtailment.","The security of which we speak is to be attained by the development of international law through an international organization based on the principles of law and justice.","The following year, after I had prepared my draft, the Conference of the Interparliamentary Union at The Hague decided to set up a special commission to study the problem seriously.","Some pacifists have carried the sound idea of the prime importance of security too far, to the point of declaring that any consideration of disarmament is superfluous and pointless as long as eternal peace has not been attained.","So long as peace is not attained by law (so argue the advocates of armaments) the military protection of a country must not be undermined, and until such is the case disarmament is impossible.","Pacifist propaganda and the resolutions of the parliamentarians encouraged such treaties, and toward the end of the nineteenth century their number had increased considerably.","Limitation of armaments in itself is economically and financially important quite apart from security.","It will be sufficient to point to the enormous burdens which armaments place on the economic, social, and intellectual resources of a nation, as well as on its budget and taxes.","In life, particularly in public life, psychology is more powerful than logic.","I am convinced that when the history of international law comes to be written centuries hence, it will be divided into two periods: the first being from the earliest times to the end of the nineteenth century, and the second beginning with the Hague Conference.","Disarmament or limitation of armaments, which depends on the progress made on security, also contributes to the maintenance of peace.","Armaments are necessary - or are maintained on the pretext of necessity - because of a real or an imagined danger of war.","Among pacifists it was above all the English who always insisted on the importance of disarmament. They said that the man in the street would not understand the kind of pacifism that neglected to demand immediate restriction of armaments."],"Ludwig Tieck":["He is not dead who departs from life with a high and noble fame; but he is dead, even while living, whose brow is branded with infamy.","The noble man is only God's image."],"Ludwig Wittgenstein":["The human body is the best picture of the human soul.","The limits of my language means the limits of my world.","If people never did silly things nothing intelligent would ever get done.","Never stay up on the barren heights of cleverness, but come down into the green valleys of silliness.","Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.","Like everything metaphysical the harmony between thought and reality is to be found in the grammar of the language.","Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.","Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death. If we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but timelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present.","If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.","A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes.","What can be shown, cannot be said.","Man has to awaken to wonder - and so perhaps do peoples. Science is a way of sending him to sleep again.","A confession has to be part of your new life.","A man will be imprisoned in a room with a door that's unlocked and opens inwards; as long as it does not occur to him to pull rather than push.","A new word is like a fresh seed sown on the ground of the discussion.","A philosopher who is not taking part in discussions is like a boxer who never goes into the ring.","Uttering a word is like striking a note on the keyboard of the imagination.","A picture is a fact.","There are remarks that sow and remarks that reap.","I don't know why we are here, but I'm pretty sure that it is not in order to enjoy ourselves.","Resting on your laurels is as dangerous as resting when you are walking in the snow. You doze off and die in your sleep.","One of the most misleading representational techniques in our language is the use of the word 'I.'","Philosophy is like trying to open a safe with a combination lock: each little adjustment of the dials seems to achieve nothing, only when everything is in place does the door open.","You get tragedy where the tree, instead of bending, breaks.","Nothing is so difficult as not deceiving oneself.","I sit astride life like a bad rider on a horse. I only owe it to the horse's good nature that I am not thrown off at this very moment.","When one is frightened of the truth then it is never the whole truth that one has an inkling of.","Logic is not a body of doctrine, but a mirror-image of the world. Logic is transcendental.","Philosophy is not a theory but an activity.","Knowledge is in the end based on acknowledgement.","Our greatest stupidities may be very wise.","Humor is not a mood but a way of looking at the world. So if it is correct to say that humor was stamped out in Nazi Germany, that does not mean that people were not in good spirits, or anything of that sort, but something much deeper and more important.","A man's thinking goes on within his consciousness in a seclusion in comparison with which any physical seclusion is an exhibition to public view.","It is so characteristic, that just when the mechanics of reproduction are so vastly improved, there are fewer and fewer people who know how the music should be played.","It is one of the chief skills of the philosopher not to occupy himself with questions which do not concern him.","An inner process stands in need of outward criteria.","Don't get involved in partial problems, but always take flight to where there is a free view over the whole single great problem, even if this view is still not a clear one.","Someone who knows too much finds it hard not to lie.","Nowadays it is the fashion to emphasize the horrors of the last war. I didn't find it so horrible. There are just as horrible things happening all round us today, if only we had eyes to see them.","Not every religion has to have St. Augustine's attitude to sex. Why even in our culture marriages are celebrated in a church, everyone present knows what is going to happen that night, but that doesn't prevent it being a religious ceremony.","The world is the totality of facts, not of things.","It seems to me that, in every culture, I come across a chapter headed 'Wisdom.' And then I know exactly what is going to follow: 'Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.'","What is your aim in philosophy? To show the fly the way out of the fly-bottle.","It is an hypothesis that the sun will rise tomorrow: and this means that we do not know whether it will rise.","Logic must look after itself. In a certain sense, we cannot make mistakes in logic.","Logic takes care of itself; all we have to do is to look and see how it does it.","One often makes a remark and only later sees how true it is.","A philosophical problem has the form: I don't know my way about.","Propositions show what they say: tautologies and contradictions show that they say nothing.","A nothing will serve just as well as a something about which nothing could be said.","The logic of the world is prior to all truth and falsehood.","Language is a part of our organism and no less complicated than it.","The world is independent of my will.","The real discovery is the one which enables me to stop doing philosophy when I want to. The one that gives philosophy peace, so that it is no longer tormented by questions which bring itself into question.","For a truly religious man nothing is tragic.","The common behavior of mankind is the system of reference by means of which we interpret an unknown language.","The face is the soul of the body.","You learned the concept 'pain' when you learned language."],"Ludwig van Beethoven":["Music should strike fire from the heart of man, and bring tears from the eyes of woman.","Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy.","Music is the mediator between the spiritual and the sensual life.","The true artist is not proud: he unfortunately sees that art has no limits; he feels darkly how far he is from the goal, and though he may be admired by others, he is sad not to have reached that point to which his better genius only appears as a distant, guiding sun.","Only the pure in heart can make a good soup.","Don't only practice your art, but force your way into its secrets; art deserves that, for it and knowledge can raise man to the Divine.","I will seize fate by the throat; it shall certainly never wholly overcome me.","I must confess that I lead a miserable life. For almost two years, I have ceased to attend any social functions, just because I find it impossible to say to people, 'I am deaf.' If I had any other profession, I might be able to cope with my infirmity; but in my profession, it is a terrible handicap.","Music is the one incorporeal entrance into the higher world of knowledge which comprehends mankind but which mankind cannot comprehend.","What you are, you are by accident of birth; what I am, I am by myself. There are and will be a thousand princes; there is only one Beethoven.","This is the mark of a really admirable man: steadfastness in the face of trouble.","Nothing is more intolerable than to have to admit to yourself your own errors.","Music comes to me more readily than words.","Art! Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great goddess?","Recommend virtue to your children; it alone, not money, can make them happy. I speak from experience.","A true artist is expected to be all that is noble-minded, and this is not altogether a mistake; on the other hand, however, in what a mean way are critics allowed to pounce upon us.","O, you men who think or say that I am malevolent, stubborn or misanthropic, how greatly do you wrong me. You do not know the secret cause which makes me seem that way to you, and I would have ended my life - it was only my art that held me back. Ah, it seemed impossible to leave the world until I had brought forth all that I felt was within me.","There ought to be an artistic depot where the artist need only hand in his artwork in order to receive what he asks for. As things are, one must be half a business man, and how can one understand - good heavens! - that's what I really call troublesome.","Off with you! You're a happy fellow, for you'll give happiness and joy to many other people. There is nothing better or greater than that!","Friends applaud, the comedy is over.","I only live in my music, and I have scarcely begun one thing when I start on another. As I am now working, I am often engaged on three or four things at the same time.","Tones sound, and roar and storm about me until I have set them down in notes.","Music is the wine which inspires one to new generative processes, and I am Bacchus who presses out this glorious wine for mankind and makes them spiritually drunken.","The barriers are not erected which can say to aspiring talents and industry, 'Thus far and no farther.'","When somewhat at a distance, I cannot hear the high tones of instruments, voices. In speaking, it is not surprising that there are people who have never noticed it, for as a rule I am absent-minded, and they account for it in that way.","Beethoven can write music, thank God, but he can do nothing else on earth.","A great poet is the most precious jewel of a nation.","I joyfully hasten to meet death. If it come before I have had opportunity to develop all my artistic faculties, it will come, my hard fate notwithstanding, too soon, and I should probably wish it later - yet even then I shall be happy, for will it not deliver me from a state of endless suffering?","Often, I can scarcely hear any one speaking to me; the tones yes, but not the actual words; yet as soon as any one shouts, it is unbearable. What will come of all this, heaven only knows!","Music from my fourth year began to be the first of my youthful occupations. Thus early acquainted with the gracious muse who tuned my soul to pure harmonies, I became fond of her, and, as it often seemed to me, she of me."],"Ludwig von Mises":["The state can be and has often been in the course of history the main source of mischief and disaster.","If some peoples pretend that history or geography gives them the right to subjugate other races, nations, or peoples, there can be no peace.","Manufacturing and commercial monopolies owe their origin not to a tendency imminent in a capitalist economy but to governmental interventionist policy directed against free trade and laissez faire.","Whoever wishes peace among peoples must fight statism.","The worst evils which mankind has ever had to endure were inflicted by bad governments.","The philosophy of protectionism is a philosophy of war.","Society has arisen out of the works of peace; the essence of society is peacemaking.","Economically considered, war and revolution are always bad business.","If history could teach us anything, it would be that private property is inextricably linked with civilization.","Modern society, based as it is on the division of labor, can be preserved only under conditions of lasting peace.","A lasting order cannot be established by bayonets.","Whoever wants peace among nations must seek to limit the state and its influence most strictly.","Men are fighting... because they are convinced that the extermination of adversaries is the only means of promoting their own well-being.","Only one thing can conquer war - that attitude of mind which can see nothing in war but destruction and annihilation.","Peace and not war is the father of all things.","Sovereignty must not be used for inflicting harm on anyone, whether citizen or foreigner.","The attainment of the economic aims of man presupposes peace.","The root of the evil is not the construction of new, more dreadful weapons. It is the spirit of conquest.","Human civilization is not something achieved against nature; it is rather the outcome of the working of the innate qualities of man.","If men do not now succeed in abolishing war, civilization and mankind are doomed.","To defeat the aggressors is not enough to make peace durable. The main thing is to discard the ideology that generates war.","War can really cause no economic boom, at least not directly, since an increase in wealth never does result from destruction of goods.","War prosperity is like the prosperity that an earthquake or a plague brings.","War... is harmful, not only to the conquered but to the conqueror.","Wars of aggression are popular nowadays with those nations convinced that only victory and conquest could improve their material well-being.","Innovation is the whim of an elite before it becomes a need of the public."],"Lui Che Woo":["If I make money, I'm happy. Even if I lose money, I'm happy.","The Chinese have always enjoyed gambling, and Macau is the only place in Greater China where gambling is legal. So I believe the government understands that there has to be a place for it.","If you don't take risks, you won't be able to do anything. I was confident I could use my experience to change and improve the way Macau worked."],"Luigi Barzini":["They eat the dainty food of famous chefs with the same pleasure with which they devour gross peasant dishes, mostly composed of garlic and tomatoes, or fisherman's octopus and shrimps, fried in heavily scented olive oil on a little deserted beach.","Public and private food in America has become eatable, here and there extremely good. Only the fried potatoes go unchanged, as deadly as before.","To put up a show is to face life's injustices with one of the few weapons available to a desperate and brave people, their imagination."],"Luigi Pirandello":["Anyone can be heroic from time to time, but a gentleman is something you have to be all the time.","Whatever is a reality today, whatever you touch and believe in and that seems real for you today, is going to be - like the reality of yesterday - an illusion tomorrow.","I would love to spend all my time writing to you; I'd love to share with you all that goes through my mind, all that weighs on my heart, all that gives air to my soul; phantoms of art, dreams that would be so beautiful if they could come true.","You too must not count too much on your reality as you feel it today, since like yesterday, it may prove an illusion for you tomorrow.","In bed my real love has always been the sleep that rescued me by allowing me to dream.","Logic is one thing, the human animal another. You can quite easily propose a logical solution to something and at the same time hope in your heart of hearts it won't work out.","Each of us, face to face with other men, is clothed with some sort of dignity, but we know only too well all the unspeakable things that go on in the heart.","Whoever has the luck to be born a character can laugh even at death. Because a character will never die! A man will die, a writer, the instrument of creation: but what he has created will never die!","Drama is action, sir, action and not confounded philosophy.","When the characters are really alive before their author, the latter does nothing but follow them in their action, in their words, in the situations which they suggest to him.","It is misery, you know, unspeakable misery for the man who lives alone and who detests sordid, casual affairs; not old enough to do without women, but not young enough to be able to go and look for one without shame!","A fact is like a sack - it won't stand up if it's empty. To make it stand up, first you have to put in it all the reasons and feelings that caused it in the first place.","Nature uses human imagination to lift her work of creation to even higher levels.","The history of mankind is the history of ideas.","I present myself to you in a form suitable to the relationship I wish to achieve with you.","When you say you are in love with humanity, you are well satisfied with yourself.","Every true man, sir, who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants does not live for the sake of living, without knowing how to live; but he lives so as to give a meaning and a value of his own to life."],"Luis Alberto Urrea":["There is beauty in our roots. Sometimes we think our roots are shameful, and people tell you that you're no good or your ancestors are no good or that you come from a neighborhood of no hope and terrible crime. But it's about the beauty of those places, and I carry that with me.","Masculinity is kind of a toxic curse, isn't it? The expectations of it were hard on me.","I'm a theological writer mistaken for a political writer. My theme is grace versus karma.","The stupidity of militarized fences between two worlds is a metaphor for all the things that divide us as human beings.","It's not like Mexicans have an illegal immigration organ in their body and at 14 kicks off a hormone and shows them how to come to the United States illegally. It's a question of desperation for a vast majority of them.","It's almost easy for me to write about a magnificent tropical village with orchids and dragonflies. That's intoxicating, but the United States is magical, too. We just forget this.","Poetry is how I feed the soul, and it's how I fire the furnace of writing.","I've been treated beautifully wherever I've gone, and I really think we all want to love each other.","The situation was kind of complicated in that my mother didn't speak Spanish. My father spoke English, you know, as best he could.","Spanish was my first language. Honestly, I learned to first speak in Spanish, not English, because my poor mother had to go to San Diego every day to work and then come back. And she would come home when I was an infant long after I was asleep.","I had not seen lawns till fifth grade - big green lawns.","I have often said I come from a family of unreliable narrators. I tend to believe their struggles with racism, identity, nationality do dovetail with my motivation to write.","Borders are liminal spaces. Anyone worthy of the title of 'writer' is a border writer. We all are border people.","I often say poetry was my first love.","Many of us writers tour like a literary Bachman Turner Overdrive. We ain't pretty, but we're on the road. Many of us wish we were rock stars anyway. For my part, I live in my iPod. The musicians there are my constant companions on the road.","I missed the Wilco phenom while busy obsessing over rock en Espanol. So imagine my surprise when I found myself at O'Hare getting on a plane with my Chi-town homeboy, Jeff Tweedy. I loved the guy right away and loved his family. How odd to know somebody before you listen to them. I don't know if that's bad or good.","My dad looked like Errol Flynn, and I think my mom thought she was moving into a hacienda, but they lived on a dirt street in Tijuana, a house jammed with relatives, nobody speaking English. She didn't know a word of Spanish. She grew up well and was appalled and humiliated, terrified of anyone ethnic.","I was torn between the Americanness my mom wanted for me and the Mexicanness my father wanted - they were wrestling for cultural influence over me.","Way back when I was working at the dump, I saw that, even when living among the trash, that some people would decide to choose joy in their lives.","It's the most absurd story. I grew up in the dirt streets of Tijuana, dying of all kinds of diseases - tuberculosis, fevers, all that - and it somehow turned into this charmed life. I don't know exactly how.","Writing went from being a calling to being a job. Business ruined things. It became like making sausages in a sausage factory.","The French-Cajun culture is similar to mine - they're Catholic, they play accordions, and they eat hot chiles.","I read most often in bed as part of my attempted sleep ritual. But I spend a lot of time reading on planes and in hotels, too.","I am addicted to poetry, but the truth is I cannot pass up a good hard-boiled mystery.","Books are like chocolate. Can't eat just one.","I love books with titles like, 'How Do You Spank a Porcupine?,' 'Arnie, the Darling Starling,' or 'The Bat in My Pocket.'","With a name like Luis Alberto Urrea, it's political no matter what I do.","People think of me as a political writer, but I don't think of myself that way.","In the end, I'm really interested in people and what we do with our short time here on earth. I'm interested in the human soul.","I don't like to see people get kicked around. You have to stand up for them.","We want to ascribe a kind of tragic grimness to people, but people are funny.","'The Hummingbird's Daughter' took 20 years to write.","When 'The Hummingbird's Daughter' came out, there was a certain backlash - 'Well, this isn't 'The Devil's Highway.'' That's just the way it goes.","I saw 'The War Wagon' with John Wayne and Kirk Douglas, but it was dubbed into German. And it had Japanese subtitles and then this little strip with some Spanish words, and I've never forgotten that weird image. It was so magical and funky.","I used to work with a relief group that took care of the people in the dump. We took them food and water and medicine and built homes and took them to church services, whatever was needed.","The concept of a literature of witness - of bearing witness - has embedded in it the need for action. One must not simply hide in the shadows and type; one must also stand in the light.","The tone of 'Into the Beautiful North' is really the way I write. 'Hummingbird's Daughter' was the anomaly. It was a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon.","A great Chicano forebear of mine in writing is Rolando Hinojosa-Smith. He was writing good border mysteries for Chicano readers back in the '80s and '90s.","I was deeply infected with storytelling from the get go, and I truly love it.","I am actually a 'Seven Samurai' fan.","I've been told not to tour down in Mexico. I am too well-known now. The kidnappers may think that my publisher will pay a ransom.","To me, writing is prayer. I pray all the time.","I'm interested in the eternal soul. That's what I write about.","I'm always fascinated by the disjunct between what's really happening on the ground and the propaganda machine that feeds America alarmist news about immigration.","It became really important to me if I was going to write 'Hummingbird's Daughter' to try to do honor to women.","We're all funny. Humor unites us.","When I was doing missionary work when I was younger, which started this obsession of mine with the literature of witness, I was a translator for a missionary group, and I spent years in a Tijuana dump. People were really thrown by the fact that the Mexican poor, many of them pureblood indigenous people, seemed happy.","Writers write without support.","When I was a little boy in Tijuana, it was wonderland. We left when I was probably four - I was dying of tuberculosis.","During grade school, we moved to a white, working-class suburb in San Diego, and there were no Mexicans.","A lot of our family was undocumented. My mom and dad were both super conservative. My dad had a green card; my mom was an Eisenhower Republican who did not approve of all the 'illegal people.'","I believe God is a poet; every religion in our history was made of poems and songs, and not a few of them had books attached.","I came to believe the green fuse that drives spring and summer through the world is essentially a literary energy. That the world was more than a place. Life was more than an event. It was all one thing - and that thing was story.","I used to approach writing like a football game. If I went out there and aggressively saw more, I'd know more, and I'd capture more, and I'd write better. Hut, hut, hut: First down and haiku!","I don't like being angry all the time; it's not good for me. I have to have serenity or else go to war.","I'm always trying to, using literature, subvert people's responses."],"Luis Barragan":["A garden must combine the poetic and the mysterious with a feeling of serenity and joy.","I think that the ideal space must contain elements of magic, serenity, sorcery and mystery.","I don't divide architecture, landscape and gardening; to me they are one.","Architecture is a art when one consciously or unconsciously creates aesthetic emotion in the atmosphere and when this environment produces well being.","It is essential to an architect to know how to see: I mean to see in such a way that the vision is not overpowered by rational analysis.","My house is my refuge, an emotional piece of architecture, not a cold piece of convenience.","Life deprived of beauty is not worthy of being called human.","Beauty is the oracle that speaks to us all."],"Luis Bunuel":["Age is something that doesn't matter, unless you are a cheese.","In the name of Hippocrates, doctors have invented the most exquisite form of torture ever known to man: survival.","Thank God I'm an atheist.","If you were to ask me if I'd ever had the bad luck to miss my daily cocktail, I'd have to say that I doubt it; where certain things are concerned, I plan ahead.","God and Country are an unbeatable team; they break all records for oppression and bloodshed.","I can only wait for the final amnesia, the one that can erase an entire life.","Fortunately, somewhere between chance and mystery lies imagination, the only thing that protects our freedom, despite the fact that people keep trying to reduce it or kill it off altogether.","The decline of the aperitif may well be one of the most depressing phenomena of our time.","Frankly, despite my horror of the press, I'd love to rise from the grave every ten years or so and go buy a few newspapers.","A paranoiac like a poet, is born, not made."],"Luis Coronel":["The reason why Millennials are inspiring is what they give: the music they give.","I promised my dad before he passed away that I would take care of the family.","I want to thank all of the L.A. fans. You've never failed me. I live through you."],"Luis Federico Leloir":["After returning from Cambridge in 1936, I did some work with J. M. Mioz on the oxidation of fatty acids in liver.","The prestige of the Nobel Prize is such that one is suddenly promoted to a new status.","We managed to prepare a cell-free system which was active when suitably supplemented, and this was a novel result since the process of oxidation was believed to require the integrity of the cells.","A logical extension of our work on glycogen was to investigate the formation of starch in plants.","The variety of polyprenol phosphate sugars may turn out to be as large as that of sugar nucleotides."],"Luis Figo":["There was interest from clubs in Italy and England, I believe. But I've never been attracted by the way they play in Italy. Staying in Spain was always my preference.","Regaining the Champions Cup is not going to be easy.","Some of the fans here were not too sure about their club signing a player from their biggest rivals. Fortunately, we had a great season and won the League title for the first time in four years. Now, I think, everyone can say it was good business.","As a professional football player, I have known perfectly well from the day I started playing that every day I have to fight for my place.","When I left Barcelona, staying in Spain was an important factor in my decision to join Madrid. I did not have to change country or learn a new language, adopt a different sort of lifestyle, and so on.","In football, day in day out, you always have to show your worth.","I have a fantastic wife, and not only in terms of external beauty. Her priority and mine is our children. That is our choice.","The mistake is to imagine that perfection is possible when the very idea is unthinkable."],"Luis Fonsi":["I definitely try to be myself and not try to imitate other performers. That's why I got my music degree. I wanted to be prepared and not be a 'product.' I want people to know that I'm not only a singer but a musician as well. I studied guitar, piano, and composition. I believe that it's just about being myself on and off stage.","Everybody lives their lives differently. They have a different perspective. They've been through different things in love. They've cried about different things.","Just when you think we're living in a little bit of a divided world, music brings us together.","'Despacito' was a song that, from the time I started writing it, I felt that its hook was really catchy and powerful but at the same time very simple.","I'm going through a beautiful stage in my life. I've learned about love, about life, about everything.","I treat every album as a new beginning, so I'm asking myself, 'What is pop music now? What are people consuming?' and I take these things into effect.","I'm still the same guy who gets in front of the mic and just sings.","It's crazy how the world evolves and the audience gives you an opportunity to really grow and live out your dreams.","It's a beautiful thing to be involved with the Special Olympics.","In my player, I have a Luis Miguel CD as well as a Brian McKnight CD. I'm known for my very romantic ballads as well as the fun, up-tempo pop songs.","I've always said that inside of me there is a rocker that wants to come out, but I'm a romantic rocker.","I talk bilingual.","As an artist, you keep learning. You draw out different parts of you.","I am 100% proud Puerto Rican but have lived two-thirds of my life in the United States. So, there will be some things I write in English, but my main way of conversing with my audience is in Spanish because, at the end of the day, I'm a Latino.","My genre is the pop ballad with a touch of R&B.","My style has a lot to do with where I've been brought up. I've lived half my life in Puerto Rico and the other half in Florida, so I listen to music in English as well as Spanish.","I block out a good amount of time - could be 6 or 8 months - and I just write. I do a lot of traveling, and I do a lot of co-writing with different writers just to start getting ideas out and kind of get a little bit of direction as far as where I'm going to go with the album.","Pushing the envelope, musically speaking, is what needs to be done to rise to the top.","Ricky Martin just kind of opened a big door, but it's always been around. Latin artists have always been there, but some of them were never doing it in the U.S.","It doesn't matter where we're from, we all have to stick together and help each other out as performers and as human beings.","My daughter is my number one fan. She has always been incredibly supportive, and she tells like it is and how it is.","It's important to stay current and fresh.","I'm not a social singer. But if one can take a social message via the romantic, that's a strong statement.","I've learned and grown as a songwriter.","I've worked my butt off. That keeps my feet on the ground - I'm the same Luis Fonsi onstage and at home cooking an omelette in basketball shorts.","Part of our job as quote-unquote 'celebrities' is that we can gather people around things that are important. I think it should be a requisite - there should be a clause in the contract that you have to give back.","Whenever I get a little chance to get to Orlando, I like to take a couple days' break with the family, just hang out, go clubbing around town.","You kind of grow up and evolve in everything you do.","Performing on Broadway is an honor and a challenge for any artist.","I love and respect theatre, so I am truly honored to have the opportunity to take my voice to the Broadway stage.","Cancer is tough. Even saying it, it's a tough word to say.","To say I was near our president, performing at the Nobel Peace Prize... I think that's an amazing thing.","I won't lie, I didn't know there was a concert. I've always known about the Nobel Peace Prize and the different prizes given out for science and this and that, but I didn't know there was a concert the day after. When they said, 'You're going to perform in Norway for the Nobel Peace Prize concert,' I was like, 'All right, I'm there.'","I sang in a group for four years, and you just kind of get used to it. You don't really think about being by yourself.","It's always morning for me until 4 in the afternoon.","That is the most important thing to me, what happens behind the closed doors in the studio and makes me an artist.","The transition to the United States was very interesting. I learned the language. I kind of got into the R&B. I'm a huge fan of the '80s, Journey and all that fun stuff. But when I moved to Orlando, it was more like Boyz II Men.","Everybody has their cliques, and I was very shy. I'm still very shy. Music opened up doors. I would get to my choir class, and I was sort of one of the better kids... I could read music. That's when I realized how good El Coro de San Juan was. I felt, for once, like, hey, I can fit in.","When I make albums, I do a lot of songwriting but not necessarily a whole album.","I like to listen to other songs to get a different point of view and to learn.","When you're singing about love stories, which is most of my songs, it's good to have a lot of information and to have a different point of view.","I don't know what happens at radio as far as what is that X factor that makes a song click and have people get connected to it when it's in another language.","At no time was I trying to write a crossover record.","I've done songs in other languages. I know how hard it is.","My family is the engine of everything, and on a personal level, I feel peace, stability, and they give me force, which is reflected on my work, my recordings, and every time that I go out on tour. They are my base, my everything.","The beautiful thing about it is that 'Despacito' is not really an English crossover. It was just another song that the world made a crossover. I didn't really push it; it just kinda went there.","I never like to get ahead of myself. I'm not one of those people that do that.","I am very optimistic, and I always think positive, but within reason and never getting too far ahead of the game.","'Despacito' started with a melody hook that I had with my guitar only. The beat for this track came after I wrote the lyrics, which I wrote as if I was writing a ballad.","Each album always has its own sound.","As a songwriter, I go into the studio, and I just try to write a great song.","It's crazy because I was 10 years old when 'Macarena' was all over the place, and I remember looking at it from a different point of view. I remember culturally how important that song was, even though people didn't really know what they were saying. It was more about the dance and the movement of it and the cultural side of it.","I wrote 'Despacito' with my guitar, but where you can tweak a lot is in the production.","The genre I listen to the most is salsa, so people look at me and see this guy who's done mostly romantic ballads, but there's always been this other side."],"Luis Fortuno":["We cannot continue to close our eyes to the fact that we have to truly embrace green jobs, new technologies and alternative sources of energy.","Hardworking Americans are fighting every day to provide for themselves and their families, and leave a more prosperous country for the next generation.","Bilingualism opens doors and provides opportunity to our children so they can shine and become successful in a labor market that is increasingly competitive and globalized.","Republicans cannot continue to oppose every Hispanic issue.","In doing what I'm doing, you have to be sensitive to the fact that you're not dealing with numbers, you're dealing with people. And I will continue to be sensitive to that.","I supported the stimulus package.","I think there is a lot of fat in the government.","The GOP can't even envision winning the White House if we lose a significant percentage of the Hispanic vote.","It is wrong to believe that Hispanics are Democrats. Hispanics are traditionally and historically conservative, not just socially conservative, but fiscally conservative.","Education is extremely important to the Hispanic community, as well as faith, and certainly working hard.","I came into office to do what was correct, not to see what was politically expedient to get re-elected.","Over 90 percent of parents in Puerto Rico want their children to be totally fluent in English.","I resent Washington telling states, or the residents of those states, what to do and what to think.","I am making sure, as the governor of a territory, that our kids speak fluent English. But having said that, I will tell my wife I love her in Spanish, and I will pray in Spanish, and no one from Washington should come down here and tell us how to go about it.","I came into the Republican party in 1980, when I was a college student at Georgetown.","I watched Reagan turn around the country by lowering taxes and controlling spending, and I'm applying the same principles.","Some people called me a fascist. That's mostly over, but there will be more attacks from the unions.","When I came into office, I could have kicked the can down the road for a little while, or I could do the right thing.","Get government out of our way, and let freedom and the spirit of the American people shine through.","Speaking and writing English perfectly should not be a privilege. To those who try to politicize this matter, I tell them now, do not mess with the future of our children.","Contrary to Eastern Europe, where the border was more porous and you could exchange information more easily, Cuba is an island. Thus, it is more isolated, and it's easier for the government to have great control over its citizens."],"Luis Gutierrez":["In the public debate, while commentators and critics have targeted immigrants with blame and bullying, our nation's immigrants have simply kept on working, kept on contributing, and kept on hoping for a solution.","The pro-life, pro-family Republicans are now pro-neonatal detention and deportation. It isn't enough to drive out the people not born here; now they want to drive out the ones that were.","We need legal immigration as an alternative to illegal immigration and a way of getting the millions of unauthorized immigrants already here to get legal and get in compliance with our laws.","We need to build bridges between the LGBT community and the larger immigrant community. In the end, the bigger the tent we build, the more successful we'll be.","DACA is a lifeline for individuals who have grown up in the U.S. but who lack immigration papers.","And they do those jobs not because they want to take away anything from America, but because they want to give their skills, their sweat, their labor, for a better life and to help build a better America, just as those who came before them.","Uncertainty and fear and ignorance about immigrants, about people who are different, has a history as old as our Nation.","Mr. Speaker, Americans want, need, and rightfully expect Congress to protect them from the prying eyes of identity thieves and give them back control of their Social Security numbers and personal health information.","Because the truth is, today's immigrants, as they have for generation after generation, work the longest hours at the hardest jobs for the lowest pay, jobs that are just about impossible to fill.","It is not new or unusual for the real Americans, meaning those immigrants who came to America a little bit longer ago, to fear the outsiders, the pretenders, the newcomers.","I am a strong supporter of President Obama and was the first national Hispanic elected official to endorse him, and I want him to be reelected in 2012.","According to the Privacy Rights Center, up to 10 million Americans are victims of ID theft each year. They have a right to be notified when their most sensitive health data is stolen.","Mr. Speaker, our Nation depends on immigrants' labor, and I hope we can create an immigration system as dependable as they are.","As far as income tax payments go, sources vary in their accounts, but a range of studies find that immigrants pay between $90 billion and $140 billion in Federal, State, and local taxes.","We watched the U.S. citizenship immigration services web site in March. They had six million, two hundred thousand hits, and two million people downloaded applications for citizenship. So what we're doing is attempting to help people in that process.","Let me respond with a few points, the first being that all immigrants pay taxes, income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, gasoline taxes, cigarette taxes, every tax when they make a purchase.","Are we going to go out and arrest and detain and deport 11 million people? Nobody would argue that that is what we are going to do, because we have never demonstrated the political will to do that, nor have we ever committed the requisite resources to do that.","And let us not forget the Social Security system. Recent studies show that undocumented workers sustain the Social Security system with a subsidy as much as $7 billion a year. Let me repeat that: $7 billion a year.","According to the study, approximately 16.7 million U.S. workers born in Latin America had a combined gross income of $450 billion last year, of which 93 percent was spent locally.","The underlying part of any comprehensive immigration bill is family unit.","We need to decouple the movement for comprehensive immigration reform and justice for immigrants from the legislative process and from the Democratic Party process. They are too linked.","If I saw someone in need and I did nothing, I'd be defacing my own humanity.","If you are brown, black, Asian, or anything other than an English-speaking, highly-trained technician, the Republican Party doesn't want you here.","Republicans will criticize whatever President Obama does because that is what they do.","We should be clear that we prefer a system that allows people to come to the U.S. with visas, not in the hands of smugglers.","We should encourage people who have lived here peacefully for years to earn legal status over time.","We must stand on principle and practicality, and we should be very clear that a policy aimed at driving out 10 or 11 million people is not a good one.","We cannot be a pro-immigrant party only when it is convenient.","The Democrats cannot say that we stand with immigrants if that secretly means we only stand with immigrants in odd-numbered years or when southern Democrats complain.","The American people are much more practical than Republican lawmakers on equal pay, on the minimum wage, on same-sex marriage, and on basic civil rights.","While jobs, education, and healthcare rank among the top issues for Latino voters, immigration is a threshold issue.","If you are opposed to immigration or support strictly punitive immigration measures, you cannot even start a conversation about other issues with most Latino voters.","On Tuesday 26 July 2011, I was arrested in front of the White House along with a dozen other pro-immigrant advocates and clergy. We sat down on the sidewalk in front of the White House with a banner that read 'One Million Deported Under President Obama' and refused to move when the police ordered us to.","Ending the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program was a serious mistake that will harm the United States and will spark a national political crisis.","Punishing individual immigrants who are deeply embedded in American communities is not the mandate Trump was given when he was elected.","I was arrested twice in demonstrations in front of the Obama White House in the push for DACA.","I have never pretended to be a legal scholar, but when scores of lawyers are lining up to agree with the Supreme Court that the president has the power to make choices when it comes to whom to deport and whom to let stay, then I tend to agree with them.","U.S. v. Arizona is a landmark case not just because of the constitutional issues related to who regulates and enforces immigration, but because of its civil rights implications, too.","We believe that the way you dress and the shoes you wear are not probable cause for questioning or arrest.","We are saying that when our nation targets law enforcement efforts at someone's appearance or what neighborhood they live in or what job they do, it is not living up to our nation's basic ideals.","I understand the frustration provoked by our broken immigration system. But 50 state immigration policies are just a recipe for more chaos.","Democrats and Republicans agree on most of a unified, politically viable, and workable immigration reform package. Both parties agree that border security is a key part of any strategy.","Legal immigrants have been an engine of economic growth, innovation, and entrepreneurship on this continent for longer than we have been a nation.","Immigration policy should be set and enforced federally.","I remember clearly the afternoon I sat down with Obama. In December 2006, he was preparing for a family trip, and the decision to run weighed heavily on his mind. As a progressive member of Congress from Illinois, I was excited and energized by the prospect of my senator, and my friend, running for president.","Senator Obama and I had been on the same side of many fights, and we had worked together on the issue that is most urgent to me - comprehensive immigration reform.","I was the first Latino member of Congress to support Senator Obama's candidacy. For quite a while, I was the only one.","As a Democrat from Illinois, as a member of Congress who believes in and admires President Obama, it genuinely pains me to say that the facts show that this president has done no more to solve our immigration crisis than George W. Bush.","Too many people fought too hard to make sure all citizens of all colors, races, ethnicities, genders, and abilities can vote to think that not voting somehow sends a message.","The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has been clear that deporting young people who have lived in the U.S. for years and were brought here through no fault of their own as children should not be the targets of deportation.","We should allow DREAMers to declare that they are not criminals, that they want to be here, want to fully participate in their society and get on the books. We should make college, work, and military service available to them.","In my experience, young people fighting for the passage of the DREAM Act and to prevent the deportation of those who are eligible are among the most committed and fearless advocates for change in this country.","In the immigration debate, some things are constant. They never change. One is that opponents of immigration reform will use it as a wedge issue and will blame everything from unemployment to rising health care costs on immigrants.","The immigrant blame game is constant. Cynical politicians believe it drives poll numbers; cynical commentators believe it drives TV ratings.","The immigrant blame game is one of the most predictable, and most deplorable, elements of public debate in our nation.","If immigration reform is bad for America's workers, then why does virtually every group that represents American workers support it so enthusiastically?","Lots of special interests play the immigrant blame game every day because they like things the way they are and don't see a need for change.","The American people overwhelmingly want to see smart policy that secures our families, our borders, and our economy.","We need the federal government to assert their supremacy over the immigration issue and make it clear to state legislatures, cowboy cops, and the American people that the federal government is in charge and effectively enforcing and regulating immigration.","Obama the President needs to stand up for what Obama the candidate and what Obama the Senator and what Obama the Chicago community organizer stood for and lead the Congress towards reform.","I am a senior Democratic Member of Congress whose parents were born in Puerto Rico and for whom Puerto Rico self-determination has been - and remains - a central issue of my congressional career.","Appeasing Wall Street is to be expected from the GOP who do little to hide their true intentions and their defense of the wealthiest financial institutions and interests.","The initials BP used to stand for British Petroleum, but like Kentucky Fried Chicken, they changed their name to improve their image. Apparently, 'Petroleum,' like the word 'Fried,' connoted a company too oily for American tastes.","BP should be Banned Permanently because they are too failed to be big.","The issue of immigration is one of the most complex and politically difficult issues because there is so much passion on all sides."],"Luis Guzman":["It's ok to show all your colors.","Well, PT Anderson sent me a script of Boogie Nights which I let lay around my house for about three months, then one day I'm cleaning my office and decided that I'd better read this before the guy calls me back. I never put it down, bro.","I always wondered if you clone your wife and have the cloned wife on the moon and the real wife down here, would that be considered cheating?","I think part of the problem is the education system doesn't work - it's not accountable.","TV is not a baby sitter.","If I want my children to learn what bomba and plena is, I will teach them.","I think the Lower East Side inspires me. That whole neighborhood, a lot of the people that I worked with, seeing what we've gone through in life, being given an opportunity to understand who I am; my identity, my culture, and my roots."],"Luis Miguel":["I think we all wish we could erase some dark times in our lives. But all of life's experiences, bad and good make you who you are. Erasing any of life's experiences would be a great mistake.","I am very adamant about keeping my private life private. I don't prefer to talk about my family.","I maintain my sanity by keeping my distance.","The most enjoyable part of my career is singing live.","I don't like rock. Honestly, I like to listen to it, but it's not for me. There's a lot of musical genres that I find interesting, but they don't suit me. It's one thing to listen to different genres, but to perform a genre that isn't yours is counterproductive."],"Luis Palau":["When you face the perils of weariness, carelessness, and confusion, don't pray for an easier life. Pray instead to be a stronger man or woman of God.","One encounter with Jesus Christ is enough to change you, instantly, forever.","It's bad when you fail morally. It's worse when you don't repent.","Evangelism is not an option for the Christian life.","God is not disillusioned with us. He never had any illusions to begin with.","Feast of the Holy Innocents The most thrilling thing you can ever do is win someone to Christ. And it's contagious. Once you do it, you don't want to stop."],"Luis Suarez":["Every player would love to get to the absolute top, and Real Madrid is it.","When I say, 'I'm sorry,' it's because I regret something.","Barcelona are always a candidate to win the Champions League.","I think all the bad things I have been through are in the past. I believe I am on the right path now, dealing with the people who can help me, the right kind of people.","Injuries are not only a physical question, which is the most important thing, of course, but also a question of your mind. If you're thinking: 'I'm not going to make it', 'I can't cope', 'it hurts', 'it's never going to get better', then it won't.","I want to change the bad boy image that has stuck for a bit because I don't think I am at all how I have been portrayed. I would like that to change because it's awful to hear and read what is said of you.","Every soccer player can be on the edge, at the limit, be the bad guy. We have to get used to it. Sometimes I am one of those.","My wife says that if people reach conclusions as to what I am like based on what they see from me on the pitch they would say I am a guy who is always annoyed, always in a bad mood, they'd say what must it be like to live with me. There are two of me, two different people.","Every forward is selfish, and any forward who tells you he is not selfish is a liar.","It is always a bit hypocritical when a defender who spends the whole game kicking you complains of being kicked.","'Negro' can refer to anyone with dark hair as well as dark skin, and I've been used to the word being used in Spanish in this way all my life.","If you win while scoring goals, then you leave happy, but the most important thing is always the team. I do not think just of me.","There are only three million people in Uruguay, but there is such hunger for glory: you'll do anything to make it; you have that extra desire to run, to suffer. I can't explain our success, but I think that's a reason.","It's important for the team not to be relying on one player.","At clubs like Liverpool, great players come and go.","I much prefer being told off by Brendan Rodgers than by my wife. Brendan is more careful than my wife with what he says.","On the field, sometimes passion overwhelms you, and you do things you regret afterward.","I will give my soul every game.","I still sleep soundly every night. I'm not worried about everything people say.","If you score 20 goals one season, then you have to promise yourself that in the following season you will get 25.","I normally try to be tranquil on the pitch.","Sometimes English football takes pride in having the lowest yellow-card count in Europe, but of course it will have if you can take someone's leg off and still not be booked.","I have always preferred to keep things to myself rather than sharing them with anyone, but I am learning that if you let it go, you feel better for it. Don't keep it all bottled up inside; don't take it all on alone.","There are people who criticise me, and that's normal because of the way I am on the pitch. I get angry, I get tense.","Nobody in England knows the real Luis Suarez.","When I was a kid, I got sent off for head-butting a referee: I ran 50m to argue a decision, I was shown a red card, and I head-butted him. I'm really not proud of that.","I've scored many goals that I've liked, but I think the best memory I have is the one against Korea in the 2010 World Cup.","I need to be playing in the Champions League.","I have to put my career first.","Liverpool will always be special for me: my daughter was born here.","Of course I don't like the fact that my wife goes to the supermarket and there are photographers. But I realise that the press attention is the same wherever you go.","I'm an emotional person, and I externalise my feelings a lot with some things, but I'm strong with others.","I wanted my children to be able to see me play at the World Cup.","Coaches have told me I can help the team much more if I don't talk, if I don't moan.","On the pitch, I argue, I shout, I talk rubbish and generally do anything I can to get ahead.","Away from the pitch, I'm a very calm person. I maybe have the odd cross word with my wife, like any relationship, but that's it.","It disturbs me that Liverpool are not in the Champions League and fighting for the Premier League.","Obviously, being a forward, I would like to score more goals. But while the team does well, there is no problem.","I'm used to being the main goal scorer, but I also always like to help.","I think the people who really know who Luis is are the people who are by my side, who have always been by my side.","When you feel you've done something wrong, you should apologise for it.","I understand why biting is seen so badly.","Everyone has different ways of defending themselves.","I'm not going to another club to hurt Liverpool.","I was asked a question: 'Would I want to play for Madrid?' It's like anyone asked if they want to change jobs and move to a bigger company.","My record shows that I'm not the kind of player who wants to change clubs every season, and I would have no problem playing in England for many more years.","When I was a kid, I had to fight for everything.","It was very hard for me as a kid to get through as a footballer in Uruguay.","I had a really hard time growing up; we were a large family, and we didn't have much money at home.","The only thing I want is the respect of the fans of Liverpool and the fans of the national team of Uruguay.","I don't read the papers or watch TV.","I've been booed in Holland and in Uruguay - as a professional footballer, you need to have thick skin and just get used to it.","When I was a kid, there were some people around me who were a bad influence. When I met my girlfriend Sofia, who is now my wife, I think it all changed. She was very important for me, because she steered me back on to the path I wanted to be on.","I think Liverpool have a long history with many great players. I hope one day to be up there with those great players. I'll try my best to write some history here.","I never imagined playing in El Clasico. I used to watch the games and look at photos, and I used to say how incredible to play in it was.","It's especially important for my little girl to see her papa at work.","When I was playing for Nacional in Montevideo, the players who lived outside the city would be given money by the club to get there and back on the bus.","Every player feels differently about playing football. We are all different people. I am the type who wants to win all the time. I hate to lose.","I've been obsessed by football since I was young.","People ask, 'How can you let a defeat hurt you so much?' But it comes back to the effort you have put into your career as a youngster.","My parents separated when I was nine, but my father was always around, and he still follows me now. He is always sending me messages.","I always want more. I always want my team to perform to their best.","After my 10-match ban in 2013 for biting Branislav Ivanovic, I had questioned the double standards and how the fact that no one actually gets hurt is never taken into consideration.","All I can say is that I have arrived with the desire to be a success at Barca, that I am hungry to win titles.","If you don't speak Spanish, then don't accuse me of insulting you in that language, let alone insulting you ten times.","Put 'Luis Suarez' into an Internet search engine, and up comes the word 'racist.' It's a stain that is there for ever. And it is one that I feel I do not deserve.","I am obviously a striker who likes to score a lot of goals and have done that in every team I have been with.","A forward always has to help the team, either with assists or goals.","I want to do things right. I really, really do.","Of course I would like to play with Cristiano Ronaldo - he is a great player.","I have a very strange way of playing football.","I'm my own severest critic, and I realize when I make mistakes.","I have been hit from all sides, and I'm only human. They have ended up talking about the way I look, and it hurts. I have a family, and they suffer, too. It has gone over the limit, and I am tired of it. I have a wife and child, too, and I am not prepared to go on putting up with it English journalists.","My first season at Liverpool had good moments but also bad ones. We played three tournaments and we played two finals, and that was good."],"Luis Videgaray Caso":["If NAFTA goes away, it's not the end of the world. It certainly is not the end of trade between Mexico and the United States.","I don't know what country's willing to export - for free - the computer scientists, engineers, doctors. It's hard to me to understand.","I think a lot of scapegoating has been done on NAFTA. The reality is, a lot of the jobs have been lost mostly to technology. And that is something that happens well beyond the reach of NAFTA or any other trade agreement.","The size of the energy sector in Mexico is just so vast; it has an outsize impact on the rest of the Mexican economy.","Mexico will under no circumstance pay for the wall that Mr. Trump is proposing.","We want to send a clear message that the Mexican government won't endanger its fiscal position, and we will remain on a path of fiscal responsibility.","What would happen if the markets suddenly questioned our ability to keep public finances in check? What would be the effect on growth?","If what is on the table is something that is not good for Mexico, Mexico will step away from NAFTA.","For any country - and that includes Mexico and the U.S. - having good, robust relationships with crucial allies and neighbors, that's putting your country first.","I think always having somebody that you trust and you know can help in the communication, that is very important.","I want to make clear, in the most emphatic way, that the government of Mexico and the Mexican people do not have to accept measures that, in a unilateral way, one government wants to impose on another. That we are not going to accept.","Mexico is much bigger than NAFTA.","We don't believe trade deals are zero-sum games.","The presidency is not a collegial body... He will surround himself with people who share his vision.","We need to stop illegal weapons flowing from the U.S. into Mexico.","We always think about illegal stuff moving through the border south to north, but people forget that most guns - and we're not talking small guns, we're talking heavy weapons - they get to the cartels and create literally small armies out of the cartels.","Mexico is a market economy, but we should have better markets.","Taxes are never popular.","It's very important that the government is close to the business community and that we understand their concerns. But at some point, the government needs to be a government.","The government needs to work to improve how markets perform.","Mexico believes in free trade.","We're absolutely open to making NAFTA better.","We always saw TPP as something that we want to be part of. In the beginning, we were not part of TPP, neither Canada or Mexico. So when we finally joined the negotiations, to us it was an opportunity.","I think TPP, as we knew it, is gone.","Mexico is an important country for the U.S. We should not forget that.","There are lots of things where NAFTA can be updated and upgraded.","I think we've been able to establish good relationships with people on President Trump's team, and that gives us an opportunity to do better than what most people expect in terms of the relationship. And we are working towards that on many fronts, particularly on trade.","We obviously don't like the idea of a wall. It's not a friendly gesture. And my own personal opinion is that it might not even work for the purposes that it's meant to work for.","The wall is not a bilateral issue. It's not something that we discuss with the American government. Every country has a sovereign right to protect its borders the best way that they see fit."],"Luis Walter Alvarez":["Most of us who become experimental physicists do so for two reasons; we love the tools of physics because to us they have intrinsic beauty, and we dream of finding new secrets of nature as important and as exciting as those uncovered by our scientific heroes.","One indicator of Ernest Lawrence's influence is the fact that I am the eighth member of his laboratory staff to receive the highest award that can come to a scientist - the Nobel Prize.","At the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, we have long had a tradition of close cooperation between physicists and technicians.","Because Ernest Lawrence's award came in the war years, I had the unusual opportunity of attending his Nobel Prize presentation ceremony.","When I received my B. S. degree in 1932, only two of the fundamental particles of physics were known.","Janet Landis came to work in my group in the summer of 1957 when our first bubble-chamber was churning out its earliest pictures.","I don't like to say bad things about paleontologists, but they're not very good scientists. They're more like stamp collectors.","If the president of the college had asked me what I thought about Dewey McLean, I'd say he's a weak sister. I thought he'd been knocked out of the ball game and had just disappeared, because nobody invites him to conferences anymore."],"Luis de Guindos":["Let nobody be fooled, the next two quarters are not going to be easy either in terms of growth or employment.","The battle of the euro is being fought right now in Spain and Italy. The future of the euro is at stake in the next weeks.","In the medium and long term. Spain is solvent and able to pay its high debts. In the short-term, we have the capacity to meet our obligations.","I don't know if we're on the edge of the precipice, but we're in a very, very, very difficult situation.","We rule out raising taxes this year.","Those who have the most, who earn the most, must give an example, because that is important for Spain's collective effort.","I don't think I've been too optimistic. The government believes the contraction will be around 1.5 per cent, as the central bank said. However, we're waiting to see the Commission estimate."],"Luis von Ahn":["People are good at figuring out what's attractive, and computers are good at quickly searching and finding. You put them together, and bang!","I have multiple ideas per day, all the time. The vast majority of these are completely idiotic. Usually, I just sit on the idea for several months. And if I have not decided that it's idiotic, then it's... might be a good idea.","My first computer was a Commodore 64. I got it as a present from my mom when I was eight years old, and all I wanted to do with that computer was play games.","I put a lot of weight on feelings and am weirdly in touch with them, which is not typical for an engineer.","I watch a lot of TV. That's how I spend most of my time outside of work. If I had more time, I would fill it 100 percent with watching TV.","When I found out that I had won the MacArthur Fellowship, I had been a professor at Carnegie Mellon for a week. I probably shouldn't be saying this on TV, but I stopped worrying about tenure.","I definitely play some games, like Nintendo D.S. or the Wii, and some computer games.","As humanity goes online, it's becoming an extremely advanced, large-scale processing unit.","Basically, I want to make all of humanity more efficient by exploiting the human cycles that get wasted.","Game design is a funny thing. There are people out there who are really good at it, but it's not clear that they can teach it. It's a very intuitive process. It's an art.","The basic idea of Games With a Purpose is that we are taking a problem that computers cannot yet solve, and we are getting people to solve it for us while they are playing a game.","Science fiction has done a really good job of scaring us into thinking that computers shouldn't get too smart, because as soon as they get really smart, they're going to take over the world and kill us, or something like that. But why would they do that?","Am I a slacker? I can be a slacker. When I was in college, most people got summer jobs for college or did research during college. I went home and watched TV the whole day for three months; it was really awesome.","Our team at Duolingo is really cohesive, but this did not just happen. I made a concerted effort to hire people who are going to play nice."],"Luise Rainer":["Happiness lies in moments, and while you have it, you're not even aware; only afterwards do you know you were happy.","The secret of a long life is to never trust a doctor.","The Oscar is not a curse. The real curse is that once you have an Oscar they think you can do anything.","I always considered myself the world's worst actress.","I had immense ambition to become a really valuable actress.","Take a person like Julia Roberts: she does what she wants.","I know the good from the bad, also the in-between, but I was never political.","For my second and third pictures, I won Academy Awards. Nothing worse could have happened to me.","I should have done more. I did too little of everything.","Some very beautiful things get lost and forgotten. Just as I got lost.","Once, I was a bigger star than Greta Garbo.","I felt very alone in Hollywood.","I have never had a current state of mind. My mind changes a great deal. I am very affected by any sorrow or sad thing, and I am very affected by joy and beauty.","One can be more than once in love - that's the most important thing.","I admire people who are creative.","I feel best in nature or near nature.","I was very thin, like a boy, and I was very un-sexy.","I remember once Robert Taylor invited me to lunch. I asked him, 'What is your ambition?' He said, 'I want to have 10 very good suits.'","I don't believe in acting. I think that people in life act, but when you are on the stage or, in my case, also on screen, you have to be true.","One of the biggest dangers in Hollywood is becoming typed.","The best imitation in the world is not half as good as a poor original.","I would much rather be a bad Luise Rainer than a second someone else.","In my acting, I have tried to do this - to present to audiences a living creature in whom they can recognise themselves or someone they know.","I was one of the horses of the Louis B. Mayer stable, and I thought the films I was given after my Academy Awards were not worthy.","I am sensitive to life, and somehow acting comes to me. I can't explain it.","I don't believe in anything artificial. I don't believe in makeup.","I am an actress. I am not a movie star."],"Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva":["In Brazil, a poor man goes to jail when he steals. When a rich man steals, he becomes a minister.","No one can reap the fruit before planting the trees.","Free trade is very important if we respect equality among nations.","Brazil is a country that has rich people, as you have in New York City, as you have in Berlin or in London. But we also have poor people like in Bangladesh or in African suburbs.","I took office as president in January 2003, and in April 2003, I sent to Congress my first proposal for tax reform. Some parts were voted on, with respect to federal taxes, and then it came to a standstill. Why? Because each state is interested in its own tax reform, has its own tax policy, and each state has its federal deputies and senators.","Brazil has rediscovered itself, and this rediscovery is being expressed in its people's enthusiasm and their desire to mobilize to face the huge problems that lie ahead of us.","Here in Davos, it is generally assumed that there is now only one god - the market.","The financial system has to be regulated, we have to end with the tax havens, and it's necessary that the central banks in the world should control a little bit the banks' financing because they cannot bypass a certain range of leverage.","I have stated publicly, I want the same things for Iran that I want for Brazil. I want them to use and develop their nuclear energy for peaceful means.","I have known Evo Morales for many years, since the days of the union movement. From a historical and sociological standpoint, the election of Evo Morales is extraordinary, with great prospects and potential for the Bolivian people.","If, at the end of my mandate, all Brazilians have the possibility to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner, I will have fulfilled the mission of my life.","Everyone is innocent unless proven otherwise.","You're going to be hearing a lot about one scrappy president.","My greatest desire is that the hope that has overcome fear in my country will help vanquish it around the world.","A war can perhaps be won single-handedly. But peace - lasting peace - cannot be secured without the support of all.","I don't need arms, and neither does anyone else... At the very least, a ban would prevent fights from turning deadly.","We've advanced in the construction of a true free-trade area across South America... What's needed now is less rhetoric and more action.","What most surprises me about Brazil is the extent of the difficulties that we create for ourselves. We create a lot of legislation to control the Brazilian state itself, that this ends up meaning that things don't go with the speed any head of government would like.","They were two and a half decades in which Brazil had no capacity to invest in infrastructure. Just to give you an idea, in 1989, we had in Brazil about 50,000 project-engineering businesses. When I took office, there were just 8,000. Universities were no longer turning out engineers.","The thing is that we live in a presidential system with a parliamentary constitution. Congress has a lot of weight in Brazil, and the president cannot always do when he wants; he does what he can.","In my opinion, the Doha Round is the most important thing that we can do to reduce inequalities, create opportunities, and develop the poorest countries, face up to the struggle against terrorism and strengthen democracy.","It is important to remember that I am not in the G-8; I am just an invited guest.","Since 1990, we have been building up the idea that democracy is the best way for sectors that feel socially excluded from politics to win power.","Latin America is convinced that, starting with South America, our way forward is to consolidate the process of integration: not theoretical integration - the integration of speeches - but physical integration, with infrastructure, with roads, with railways, with communications, with energy.","I believe together, with the OAS, everybody condemned the coup d'etat, and everybody is demanding that President Zelaya should go back to the presidency, and they should call for general elections and realize an election. That's what we want. And I believe that President Obama made the right decisions condemning the coup d'etat.","I learned during my term and in the presidency that we should not discuss about assumptions or insinuations. If one day I have to do something against the U.S., the first one to get to know what I was going to do would be the president of the U.S.","I know what unemployment means because I was unemployed for one-and-a-half years, and I know the drama that the worker and unemployed worker faces. I know the world of the labor union better than I think anyone else does.","Brazil does not want to become an exporter of crude oil. No. We want to be a country that exports oil byproducts - more gasoline, high-quality oil - and to strengthen the petrochemical industry.","No one has to agree with everything that someone else says. But in state-to-state relations, we have to understand that we can help each other much more doing it that way. We have to be more generous.","Venezuela needs to develop; economic growth is essential for the country after so many years of lagging behind.","When President Kirchner complains, I often sympathise with him, because Argentina was deindustrialised, and it is perfectly normal for the president of a country to try to get industry back.","I have suggested that Brazilian enterprises invest in Uruguay and Paraguay. These are small economies, so some things can be produced in these countries that will give them greater and more equitable involvement in the Mercosur game.","If there was one last thing I could do in my life, it would be to help Dilma turn this country around, with the decency that the Brazilian public deserves.","It is a coup because while the Brazilian Constitution allows for impeachment, it's necessary for the person to have committed what we call high crimes and misdemeanors. And President Dilma did not commit a high crime nor misdemeanor. Therefore, what is happening is an attempt by some to take power by disrespecting the popular vote."],"Luka Sulic":["Even in classical music, the cello doesn't get a lot of respect because the piano and the violin get it all.","The range of the cello is so big, it can play as low as the double bass and as high as the violin. It has the perfect shape, and its sound is the closest to the human voice.","Of course, there will always be, you know, conservative classical people who will judge you, but you know, who cares about them?","The cello is such a versatile instrument. It can rock like the hardest rock guitar, and it can sing like the human voice. We couldn't do what we do without the classical training. It's a hard instrument to play. There are no frets, and it takes finesse and technique to play.","We wanted to make a powerful cello sound in order to show to the world the possibilities of the cello and to use it in a different way than the classical way they are used to. We wanted to play something exciting, something crazy, something to draw younger generations to this great instrument.","Don't wait for someone to call you up. You can do anything. You have all the possibilities in the world.","People don't think of cello as a rock instrument, really, and we want people to know all the possibilities that the cello can offer.","I like to swim a lot, while Stjepan likes to take long walks with girls. He's the very romantic type. Yes, musicians are romantic.","Now, we are still learning how to approach girls, you know, learning what to say, etc., because the practice we've had was with our other girl, the cello. If you noticed, it has the shape of a female.","A cello can sound like so many instruments, but it's only one, you know, like a guitar; it has percussive qualities. It can sing like the violin, you know, like a voice.","It has endless possibilities, and but what we do with our arrangements, we move the borders of cello playing and discover new ways of new techniques of cello playing.","Of course we had the best possible classical education, which gave us a very strong foundation and tradition. But we also learned a lot by collaborating with different pop/rock artists and especially by recording and working in the studio.","Many classical musicians lack pulse and rhythmical strength and precision, so for us it was very important to acquire and learn those.","It took us three months to finish the arrangement of 'Thunderstruck.'","For us, it is all about breaking the boundaries between different genres of music and combining different styles of music and performing what we are passionate about. We are so lucky that we can experience both worlds: the more intimate classical world and the wild and crazy world of rock n' roll.","Everybody recommends New Zealand. I really want to learn this haka, the traditional dance - I love it; it's so cool.","Everything was so fresh and unique to us - it was a whole new world of music. Michael Jackson was so fresh, you know? We could approach it with such fresh ears, which wouldn't be possible if we had been listening to it when we were younger.","Because in classical music cello is not regarded as a popular choice, it's always playing the long, boring notes.","We want to connect all these musical worlds together. We just improvise; we know straight away if its going to work or not. They're not covers - I hate the word cover. We do a transcription: mix it up, put our own spin on it. I think people will be surprised how powerful our show is.","I started playing when I was 5. I'm from a family of musicians.","We tune differently, and we use some tricks. There's just the two of us for much of a concert, so we want a big sound. We do use some guitar effects, distortion and delay. Playing cello with distortion sounds so good.","When our video of 'Smooth Criminal' came out, suddenly we started getting all kinds of offers. We were getting calls from TV shows like 'Ellen DeGeneres' and from record labels.","We were never happy with the way cello was recorded, and we wanted to experiment in the studio to make the cello rock as much as possible. On the second album, we had great help from Bob Ezrin, who helped us develop our sound even more."],"Lukas Forchhammer":["I think it's an important thing, if you grew up in a neighbourhood that's different from the rest of the world, to remember what was different about your place and keep that in your heart, because that's what made you.","I don't like the whole 'slander, slander' conversation that most political debates are these days. So I tend to keep my political standpoint not to myself, but just relatively private.","Here in America, the big-brand collaborations kind of signify how far you've gotten. So in that sense, it's a giant kudos to us that we, within the first year, get to be the first ones to be the launchers of this Pepsi Sound Drop.","I find it a very, very powerful thing to be yourself and not to try and be something else and to use that as your biggest shield and your biggest attack in the world - to just be you.","I don't know how to thank all the people listening to our music. It's so amazing to come home to my friends who resist conformity, because they're so happy that I've made it.","We're surprised, ecstatic, vibrant and exultant about the success of '7 Years.'","I grew up with nothing, and I know that I don't need anything to be happy. We were wearing second-hand clothing and eating leftovers, and I was so happy. Five-star hotels and private pick-ups hasn't changed that.","We don't take advantage of our position. We keep saying no to free stuff, as we can afford it now.","Our art, in a sense, is quite revolutionary.","We're talking about growing up in regular families, dreaming about better things, instead of popping bottles in the club and spending a lot of money that you don't have while living in your mother's basement.","It's not that I'm trying to write another '7 Years' or a new version of 'Mama Said.' Songs just kind of come out of nowhere, and you need to catch them when they do.","I never watched any award show.","It's always more fun when something happens outside of a script.","When we perform music at TV shows, we always try to do something that's not scripted because anything that's a surprise for the audience and the crew and the other performers, it works better on camera and for the people back home, too.","The neighborhood where I live has little canals, and there are a lot of houseboats there.","Seeing my child born is so much more important than anything else I've got going on.","I always saw law as a performance, just like being on a stage.","I just thought it would be awesome to become a lawyer, especially being from a neighborhood seeing the police rough up so many people unnecessarily, people who haven't done nothing. Growing up with kids from dysfunctional families and stuff, I just felt that some kind of difference could be done. And now I'm getting to do it with music instead.","I'll probably stay in Copenhagen... I can keep writing songs about my local community and about crime.","If I moved to L.A., I wouldn't move to a ghetto neighborhood. I'd move to some posh, fancy place.","I've always wanted to release records in America. That's where I believe the music belongs, and the style and the eclectic musical mix that we put together kind of belongs here.","Listening to all these different musical genres from all over the world and listening to my father's record collection, the Irish folk influences from home. Of course they're all in there somewhere hiding within the lyrics and melodies. But rap music was the biggest influence on my way of writing and my performing.","If it was up to me, it would be nice not ever to get stopped on the street, because we just do music. I didn't do this to become a celebrity.","I don't think I can remain anonymous for that much longer. It was fun while it lasted. Very fun.","I really like singing. I believe that if I wasn't a good singer, I would have been tossed out of school.","My biggest influence is rap. It spoke to me, probably because of my upbringing in Christiania. You listen to 'The Chronic' and you can hear that anger and frustration.","I was writing rap at 12 years old and began writing songs as a 20-year-old. I think I wrote my first song in the winter of 2008-2009, when I was in Buenos Aires. I was writing about growing up and my boys back home.","When my dad died, my world crumbled.","What hit me in the gut about hip-hop was that someone else grew up tough enough to be angry at the entire system.","When you get frisked by the police at the age of 10, and they empty your schoolbag out in the street and kick your books around and calling you names because of where you live, you just get an anger towards everyone who is outside of your neighborhood.","I never want to lose sight of my roots... A lot of artists want the riches and the fame. I want to tell stories you can put into the context of your life.","I don't play any instruments. I don't produce. I don't know which keys or chords I am using, so, in essence, I need the band and the production team - otherwise, I am just some guy with a hat and a song.","It's very satisfying when you see your song at the top of the charts.","'7 Years' seems to have attracted a lot of age groups - people seem to see their own lives in the song, and it's great to see so many people reacting in that way to it.","I don't know why, but I don't fancy writing love songs; I never have.","Christiania has a lot of strong, nuclear families. It gave us a sense of empowerment and belonging and richness. We had so much love; we were never in doubt that we were wanted in this world.","In the early '90s, my cousin gave me a Snoop Dogg cassette tape, and the rawness of the lyrics were something new to me.","I think losing my father was OK in the sense that it's cool for me not to have a father; it's normal. I'm supposed to bury my father. But what I didn't realize was that my father was my best friend, and that still gets me... that still irritates me a lot.","I write instead of going to the shrink!","I remember getting a toilet in our house. I remember sharing a bedroom with my sister, and my little sister was sleeping in my mom and dad's room.","Our goals, our dreams and ambitions have always been towards performing live music across the globe, and so when we were told we were performing at The Billboard Awards or being nominated for a VMA, they're like extra bonuses.","We're like, 'Woah, are we even in that league where we get nominated for a VMA?' And yet our name is right down there among the other nominees. It's very, very strange coming from a country of five and a half million people.","I wish we could not ever get recognised on the streets, do no selfies, and still perform music all over the world. Unfortunately I don't think that's going to be the case, but I'm doing my best to just keep my feet on the ground and my eyes on the prize.","Dr. Dre's '2001' album changed modern pop music.","I dropped out of law school when I got my record deal.","We mix a lot of genres - soul, pop, jazz - but we most agree on hip-hop.","The lyrics are the essential part in our songs.","I bought a restaurant - that was pretty expensive.","'7 Years' is, you could say, a song that eats its own children. That we need to get past the song and get to the person and get to the record and get to the music so we can keep releasing.","We have a big fan base in Australia, but none of us have been before.","We've had to be escorted out of venues, things like that. We get security guards now.","The last thing I want is for people to say that the music is nice. It's not nice. It sounds good, but it's got grit, and it's got edge. It never veers into sweet.","That's why I can't listen to a whole record of Adele's. She has the most amazing voice, but people must have convinced her they just want to hear love songs.","Graham was my father's second name, so I took Graham because Lukas Graham sounded cool.","The songs were there before the band was there, and it's my songs. And it's like, we're not in the 1950s. We can't call ourselves, like, 'The Revolvers' - it just doesn't work that way. And 'The Lukas Graham Band' just sounded wrong.","I don't mind Ed Sheeran, but I wouldn't want to be compared to a guy that builds his song around a guitar, since we do not have a guitar in our band.","I get emotionally spent answering questions about my dead father and my criminal friends and my upbringing in a hippie environment in a marginalized community.","The furthest I can see is me being 60.","Writing is very cathartic for me.","I write about what happens in my life - and my dad's passing was a huge blow to me.","A part of me understands why a mother is equally proud of all her children, but that little boy inside me just wants my mom to say, out loud but even just to me, 'I'm a little bit prouder of you.'"],"Lukas Foss":["There is another interesting paradox here: by immersing ourselves in what we love, we find ourselves. We do not lose ourselves. One does not lose one's identity by falling in love.","That is why the analogy of stealing does not work. With a thief, we want to know how much money he stole, and from whom. With the artist it is not how much he took and from whom, but what he did with it.","To come to grips with creativity, I must ask creative, adventurous questions - the kind which, in all likelihood, cannot be answered.","As I sit down and start to work, I often panic. I stare at the empty piece of music paper. How can I say that my piece will be ready for performance next January when I do not have a recipe for making it happen?","Yes, influences are enriching, and they can be found in every work of art, even the most original.","Why do we pigeonhole and label an artist? It is a sure way of missing the important, the contradictory, the things that make him or her unique.","When I went back to visit my native Berlin after World War II, I noticed that the only thing I really remembered from my childhood Berlin days is the shoe store.","Truth is a big concept.","Truth implies meaning.","To understand Mozart's contradictory qualities would indeed be to understand genius.","To me, Mozart is our Shakespeare, the one who wrote the most dramatic, psychologically most baffling music. He combined ideas that no one else would have thought of putting together.","The fact that Stravinsky used the classics as a major influence is obvious. What is interesting is how he used them, how he turned Bach into Stravinsky.","The creative act is like writing a letter. A letter is a project; you don't sit down to write a letter unless you know what you want to say and to whom you want to say it.","The best way to investigate the elusive phenomenon called the creative process may well be to target all the misconceptions, to explain what the creative process is not.","Since age seven, I've been composing and have never stopped composing, yet, the creative process is as elusive to me as it has ever been.","Personality is essential. It is in every work of art. When someone walks on stage for a performance and has charisma, everyone is convinced that he has personality. I find that charisma is merely a form of showmanship. Movie stars usually have it. A politician has to have it.","My students frequently ask what their next project should be. My advice: immerse yourself in the music you love and you will find what you want to do; you will discover your next project.","Mozart wrote so many works in his thirty-five years that it would take a lifetime just to write out the notes. We literally do not know how he did it.","Most people think an artist tries to be original, but originality is the last thing that develops in the artist.","Most artists have experienced the creative block. We get stuck in our work. We beat our head against the wall: nothing. Sometimes, it is because we are trying something at the wrong time.","It is the element I miss in electronic music - no performance, no loving immersion. Maybe that is why I was never particularly drawn to electronic music.","It is obvious that anything a scientist discovers or invents is based on previous discoveries and inventions. The same applies to the arts.","In the nineteenth century the more grandiose word inspiration began to replace the word idea in the arts.","If one uses music that one does not really love, then one will not succeed in making it one's own.","I strongly suggest that we play down basics like who influenced whom, and instead study the way the influence is transformed, in other words: how the artist made it his own.","I still do not know where the notes will come from when I accept a commission for a new work.","I don't dare postulate about science, but I know that it takes both emotion and intellect in order for art to happen.","Great music does not just make me feel good. It means something. It makes us understand. It makes us happy.","For years that may mean imitation. Then, one day, it is like a door opening, and a new thought comes in. Why not try this instead. Suddenly he is doing something original, almost in spite of himself.","Anybody can put things together that belong together. to put things together that don't go together, and make it work, that takes genius like Mozart's. Yet he is presented in the play Amadeus as a kind of silly boy whom the gods loved.","Any creator owes a debt to past creation."],"Lukas Haas":["I was in Kansas for about a month, and we worked most of the time in a very small town, so it felt like the production basically took the whole town over. In a way, we were the Martians in Kansas.","It was a wonderful experience to work with Sylvia. She pushed me to be more powerful with my acting, and she told me scores of the most incredible stories I've ever heard. She is amazing.","It's cool to play a sinister bad guy who also has a human side.","This was basically the first time I got to act in action scenes, with things blowing up all around me. It sounds corny, but I think every actor would like to - at least once in his or her career - play the person who saves the entire world.","On a low-budget film, you don't have all the luxuries.","Material Girls was so different for me, I'd never done a teen movie.","In choosing any role, I ask the same questions: what kind of part is it? is the role challenging? does the director have a vision? is the story moving? etc.","I also couldn't pass up the opportunity to be in the same movie as Jack Nicholson and Glenn Close.","A low budget is uncomfortable.","I've been into music for a long time. I started playing drums when I was 8 and piano when I was 10, then bass and guitar when I was 18.","I've built an 8-track studio in my house that's virtually identical to what they used at Abbey Road, and I also own the 16-track set-up that Led Zeppelin used to record 'Houses of the Holy.' I'm interested in producing, but I'm mostly recording my own stuff.","I've had offers to sign a record deal, but the people I've talked to have wanted to package me and have me meet with songwriters who've written stuff for Whitney Houston, that sort of thing. That's not at all my style.","I'm remixing an R.E.M. track called 'I've Been High' from their last album, 'Reveal.' It's a beautiful song, but record execs didn't put it out as a single because it didn't sound like the R.E.M. we're used to. So I asked Michael Stipe if I could have the tapes to do a remix, and he agreed.","I love seeing people having fun. Everyone over in L.A. is too cool for it. That's the problem.","One day when I was like 9, I heard the Beatles on the radio, and I asked my dad who they were. He told me they were the best band in the world, and I became obsessed. He started giving me their albums in sequential order, and I listened to them - and only them - until I was probably in high school.","I like both music and acting, and they both have a lot in common - timing, immediacy, stuff like that. But acting is more regimented. You wait around for hours, you don't get to write the script, you get hired. Music represents me better. I'm not acting; I'm just expressing myself.","Balancing my film career and my music will be something I'm just going to have to deal with, as it happens. I think I can balance it out; the choices will probably be pretty clear. If there's a movie I just have to do, I will work the music around it."],"Lukas Rosol":["Every single match, every single point, I have to concentrate.","Sometimes I can wake up and I can beat anyone.","Sometimes, how I said already, I just wake up and play good. And sometimes I'm so tired.","For me, it's important to stay healthy more than it is to have one good victory.","I never had goals to be in the top 10 or top five in the world. I just try to find the borders, find what level I can reach. I have a good team around me, so hopefully it's going to get even better."],"Luke Benward":["My mother told me, 'Always do your best,' and my dad says, 'It's important to be humble. That's the key. They're not there for you. You're there for them.'","If you don't stand up to your fears, have bravery, loyalty, and you don't have friends, you'll never win. You'll never feel better about yourself.","I believe the favor of God on my life is not for me to keep to myself and become proud of, but to be used for others... I believe God has a plan for me in the entertainment world.","When I was little, my mom was an actress, and she still is now, and she'd go on commercial auditions, and if they needed a mom and a son, she'd take me along, and that's how I got started.","I just kind of feel like it's my choice to do what I want to do. And my agent, he's totally with it. He tells me, 'You can turn down any audition you don't want to.'","I'd love to play in, like, a 'Lord of the Rings,' or something like that, or a James Bond or, you know, just something like with action, shooting.","I always remember loving 'Even Stevens' - that show was so brilliant and funny and smart.","I'm a big Leonardo DiCaprio fan. And if I could have a career like his... he's amazing. And not only his career, his public persona and how he carries himself.","I want to be in 'Star Wars.' That would be amazing.","I've always loved to incorporate music into acting because I have a passion for both.","I'm really scared of clowns, and for a while, I was scared to perform and sing in front of a crowd. Also, I'm not a big scary movie guy. They stay with me for a while.","One year, my family and I dressed up in the theme of 'Wizard of Oz' for Halloween. We all went as the different characters. I was the Tin Man!","In 2nd grade, a girl who was a friend of mine gave me a homemade valentine. Like, a real, handwritten one!","I really like 'Passion of the Christ.' I like that movie. I also like 'We Were Soldiers,' and 'Braveheart.' And 'Napoleon Dynamite' - that movie was funny.","I have done a Hamburger Helper commercial, a Hardees commercial, a McDonalds commercial. American Express commercial."],"Luke Bracey":["No one I knew in Sydney was thinking about how they might come to America and become a movie star. That would be considered delusions of grandeur. My parents were supportive, though. They just told me to keep at it as long as I was having fun.","No, 'Point Break' for me - growing up on the beaches of Sydney as a surfer, it was kind of the movie that we watched every week. For me to be Johnny Utah, I'm beside myself.","I see similarities in the sports I played growing up in the sense of how I tackle a role when I get a job. A lot of effort goes in on an individual basis. There is a lot of time spent by yourself working on your craft and what you have to do. But, at the end of the day, you're there to serve the movie just like you would the rugby team.","I'm really into the idea of telling stories. Everyone needs stories. Everyone needs to escape every once in a while.","I moved to Los Angeles when I was about 20, all by myself. It was exciting. I had this moment when I felt like I needed to put on my big-boy pants and just make that leap to see what would happen.","My poor mother. Every time I get a job, she asks, 'Am I gonna have to watch you kiss someone again in this one?' and I say, 'You're probably gonna have to watch me kiss someone in most of them, Mom.'","With action movies, that's just fun stuff for me. That's me being a kid again. Same with 'The Best of Me' and these romantic dramas. It's such a freedom from reality and social constructions. You get to just have fun and play and be in a movie.","'Point Break' is a movie that I and all of my friends grew up loving, watching all the time, quoting, living and being.","At the end of the day, it is just a movie, and we should remember that we're doing it for the audience, and we should have fun doing it. If we have fun doing it, it will come across on the screen.","I thought I'd be a professional rugby player or go to university and get some degree in construction.","I remember my first night in L.A. I was sitting outside, looking out at the city and thinking, 'I don't know anyone.' I just approached it as a big adventure. I still think of it that way.","I wake up every day and look at my own ugly mug in the mirror and don't think twice about it. The fact that other people might want to look at me still feels funny. It's flattering, but funny.","You can make movies and not particularly get along with the people you're working with but, when they say 'Action,' your job is to make it look like you're in love.","I like to think of myself as a romantic person!","I've still got to go and see the world, but I will come back to Australia in the end, when I have my family, in many moons to come.","I grew up surfing. My dad probably put me on a surfboard before I could walk."],"Luke Bryan":["From my dad I learned to be good to people, to always be honest and straightforward. I learned hard work and perseverance.","Just really, really believe in what you're trying to do. Don't let people alter that. Let people advise you and lead you down paths to make smart business decisions. But trust your instinct and trust that overwhelming drive that made you put all your dreams and everything on the line.","Growing up in Georgia, my dad was a farmer and we worked in agriculture, so we were always looking up at the sky, checking if rain was in the forecast. That always set the tone for the mood in my household, whether we had rain coming in or not - we knew the crops would be good and it was going to be a good week around the Bryan household.","Every day I wake up and I lay in bed counting my blessings and saying my prayers for how fortunate I am to have great fans and health and family.","Life's up and down from the time you get here to the time you leave.","Probably fishing is my first passion.","It's kind of like a college degree... when you get one, no one can take it from you. When you get to say for the rest of your life that you've got a platinum album, that really means something.","It's pretty cool to see how far music can take you.","I think certainly after every show I headline, I will be available to the fans. When I'm headlining a show, I don't walk off stage. I'll walk to the front of the stage and sign hats and shirts and tickets for 15 to 30 minutes, until everyone has everything signed.","I'm a really, really optimistic and really, really positive person. My main thing is, 'Enjoy life. Celebrate life.'","I grew up in a family where everybody had a good time and we were at the lake every weekend and going to the beach and living a good life. It's been the way we always lived, and my wife's the same way - enjoy every day and have fun.","You always have to work to become a better singer, songwriter and performer.","I always look back to awards shows and think about being a kid watching them.","I've been so blessed to have my career gradually get bigger and bigger, so I've been able to absorb stuff and take stuff gradually.","I always want to make an album that lets people immerse in it, kind of like you get caught up in a good movie.","American Idol allowed us to find Carrie Underwood.","That's gotta be the one remaining constant - jeans have gotta be tight, baby.","I've always enjoyed things going at a nice pace, nothing too fast, nothing too crazy.","Even with all the negativeness of the whole social media thing, I still think it's leaps and bounds more positive.","I always want to have a personal relationship with everybody that works for me.","You see a lot of people out there that say they're country, and they do their little things that are stereotypical country things, but being country is a way of life.","If I wake up one day and people tell me I'm not sexy, I'm not going to stop making good music and having fun. That 'sex symbol' thing is typically part of being in the limelight. You better be very talented in your music, but it's good to be nice to look at, I guess.","You know, if Kelly Clarkson wants to do country albums because that's what inspires her, then let her do it. Look at Kanye West or Ludacris... they aren't rappin' and cussin' like they were on their first few albums, so what does that make them? It's all in the eye of the beholder and the listener. We all use our outlet to grow ourself.","I used to work at my dad's peanut mill, and worked 15 hours a day, 6 days a week. So, now, riding around on a nice tour bus and doing shows, you'd have to get picky to have a downside.","We're putting on a show, and if I'm dancing and having fun, you can take a shot of the crowd, and they've got smiles glued to their faces.","Anytime I sing the anthem, it is an honor and my heart beats out of my chest.","I just like Forrest Gump. Maybe I'm a little smarter than him, maybe I'm not. Probably because of the whole Southern aspect of his character and for some reason I always wind up on the better end of all deals... I've just kind of got the old silly boy luck!","I want to be comfortable on TV. If I'm comfortable, they're comfortable watching me. I think nothing's more icky than watching icky on TV.","I'll never forget when me and Jason Matthews wrote the line, 'Don't be a tape player hater,' in 'Country Man,' I don't think I ever laughed harder. We didn't know where we were gonna put that in a song, but we knew we had to make it into a song. I just remember laughing and being so proud of such a goofy little line.","Obviously, fans are the beginning and end for any artist. The minute your fans embrace you and accept you, you begin this ride of being in music and having a career doing something you love. You get to go be a kid and live out your dreams by performing music for fans who come out to your shows.","My dad is very successful in his business. He's always been big in having hobbies and having little ways to get away. He always made time for hunting and fishing. He always encouraged me to do it.","You want women to think of you in a sexy manner. It's all part of the business. It drives ticket sales. It's all a part of it.","My focus is trying to make great music and putting on great shows, and whatever happens beyond that is a bonus to me.","My first memories of music were country music and Ronnie Milsap. Where I grew up, it was what you listened to. And anything else, you were somewhat out of place.","I'm a big sports fan in general.","Anything I've ever read by John Irving has been really well written.","A lot of people don't have near the amount of success as I've been blessed to have, and it's all about working hard and hoping that continues.","Nothing is more rewarding than to take a song, create it out of thin air and then watch it affect people.","I refuse to be one of those artists who, 10 years from now, they're bitter about the rise and the fall of their career. I understand that somewhere there's a peak and a crest for me, and I'm going to enjoy all levels. I'm going to enjoy this ride that I'm on, and when it slows down, that's when it will be time for another phase of my life.","With every album, the approach is find the best songs you can find, write the best songs you can write and try to sound better.","I think the attraction to country music is the fans, the lure of the hardcore fan base.","You never take your fans for granted. You always appreciate them every show, night in, night out.","I don't keep diaries anymore; They're quite incriminating. I just keep all the dirt road diaries in my head.","My main thing is I'm gonna go out there every night and give it all I got and just try to put on the best show I can. That's just the way I'm programmed and wired.","To have your first No. 1 as an artist was everything I could have ever dreamed for. Now we're keeping our fingers crossed, and hopefully we'll have many more, but there's certainly nothing like the first one.","I think 'Country Girl' is one song that can veer into country or hip-hop or rap. You can listen to it and enjoy the humor and the fun in it.","My thing is to get up there and have a good time and give the fans all you can and appreciate them spending their money and being in the stands - and just be appreciative of them cheering when you come onstage.","My thing is, when you put a bunch of rules on a tour, you have to hire three more people to enforce all the rules. So, with me, I want everyone to feel comfortable. It's a lot of little moving parts out here, and little hiccups will come. At the end of the day, the show's going to go on, and I want everybody to truly enjoy it.","Our crew guys, it's amazing what they have to go through to make a show happen every night.","When you look into the eyes of your people out there that came to see you, that's when it's like, 'Yep, this is what it's all about.' This is why we don't sleep, and this is why we write songs and try to be the best. This moment right here onstage.","As far as heroes thorough the years, I'd say definitely Alabama and Randy Owen, Conway Twitty was a big influence of mine, George Strait, Lionel Richie.","I think the defining moment in my career is the day that I moved to Nashville - September 1, 2001. That's the biggest step to getting here is making that move. Anything that happens, the wonderful opportunities that happen to you, can't happen until you make that move.","It's a good community, country music, because we get the chance to sit down and... me and Tim McGraw spend a lot of time. Me and Kenny Chesney had the opportunity to spend a lot of time together. It's been a lot of great advice through the years.","My best artist friend is definitely Jason Aldean. He and I really get along great and are really great friends. It's fun to tour with a buddy and somebody that I just enjoy hanging out with. If we weren't touring together, we'd be hunting in the off-season still and knocking around doing stuff, certainly.","Early in my songwriting career, when I was learning a lot about writing songs, I'd force myself to sit down until I came up with something.","'Tailgate Blues' is kind of a lyrical masterpiece of a country song.","My thing is you just have to try to feel young and stay young. Obviously you get a little older, but I still want my music to be young. I don't want to sound like an old dad onstage, so you just have to write music that sounds young.","I would like to be a heart surgeon or brain surgeon... something with that knowledge and the ability to save a life would be pretty cool. I wasn't that good in science class, though.","I think it's always important to constantly keep the band on their toes and try new things that you hope will work. That's how 'Apologize' was born, and maybe down the line another little song will be born by that mentality. I've always really liked that song.","I've been out with lots of other artists opening for them on tour, and you just learn that none of their success came easy - it was all hard work for them, and you have to buckle down and get ready for the hard work yourself, too.","That's the beauty of country music - you have to get out there and earn it and work hard. And when you're on the road with big name acts, you realize there's no easy way to the 'Promised Land' in this business.","I wouldn't necessarily say she is a country artist. I mean, obviously Taylor Swift started in country, but she morphed into somewhat of a cultural icon, so, who am I to judge what she is?","There's always room for your hard-core country songs, and that will always shine through, and I'll always have those on my albums. And then I'll have fun stuff that gets people up and dancing that some people may want to say, 'Well that sounds real pop-y!' but I don't really think it does, I just think it's what's going on.","I hope someone thinks I sing good. I'm always working hard to sing better. I sound the way I sound, but I can always be better. I work hard at singing and being a better recording artist.","I'm kind of at a point in my career where I can get away with traditional stuff and then get away with some more rocky and pop and edgier stuff, too.","'Dirt Road Diaries,' in my mind, is a perfect country guy song. It speaks to the hard-working guy, and I'm excited for the fans to hear that one.","I will always really work hard to write as much as I can, but I also love sitting back and waiting on those big Nashville songwriters to send me some great songs, too.","My path is exactly where I want it to be. I'm doing my thing. I'm getting better with every album.","When you get performance slots for award shows - that's a big deal for me.","I want my music to jump off the stage and out of the speakers. When we do 'Rain Is A Good Thing' paired back to back with 'Country Girl,' it just feels like the roof is fixin' to come off the place.","Nothing is more frustrating to me than putting a song on an album and regret putting it on there. I'm excited that there are no songs on 'Tailgates & Tanlines' that I'm iffy about.","I'll always have songs with a farm connotation on my albums. It's in the fabric of my music, and I plan to keep it that way.","I would say my fraternity was nothing but a bunch of farm boys; we weren't really in the whole fraternity scene, but yeah, that's a safe assessment of who I am. I've lived that life, growing up in agriculture and then going off to college and joining a fraternity, livin' that life.","I don't give any merit to criticism. 'Country Girls (Shake it for Me),' I can see where people view that as sexist, but I just view that as having fun.","When I'm writing a song, it's just me and the songwriters. Then when the song is done, there are publishers that hear it, then people in my management, then my wife and my boys and my friends, and if they're all lovin' it, it's kind of withstanding all the criticism I need.","I love nothing more than to perform my songs in front of a live audience. And whatever I'm doing is driven toward finding or writing songs and putting out hit songs that drive people coming to see me live. Because, at the end of the day, that's what I enjoy the most.","You get weird, funny requests on Twitter. With our fan club, I was seeing a lot of fans were having some issue with the way the fan club tickets were being handled in one of the shows. So I was able to correspond with that fan, and be like, 'Listen, we'll be on it.'","Anytime you have a fellow artist say, 'Loving the new Luke Bryan album,' that's awesome.","When the show opens, fans can text to a number we flash up on the screen, and then we do a meet-and-greet with 60 to 80 people every night. It's something I love doing, and I would say that's probably more fans than most artists bring backstage after a show.","If there are people out by the bus, I'll come off the bus and sign autographs, too. I always want to be accessible. I always tell my fans, 'If I ever get on the bus and don't come off, it's because I'm under the weather or I'm really tired.'","I got my iPad, and I'm trying to buy books on that, but I kind of like a book. At the end of my life, when I'm old, I want to have all these shelves full of books. So I'm just gonna do the book thing.","I thought being on stage was an amazing feeling, but there is nothing that can top watching my wife bring our son into this world.","I'm excited to be part of a movement that's progressing country music. There's always gonna be people saying, 'It ain't country anymore,' but I don't get into that whole deal.","I try to be a good representative for country music. But as a country artist, it's important to move the needle and make a difference beyond your core audience. But you can't ever strategically try to accomplish that; then things get weird.","I just cut songs I love and that represent what I want to say. And if it crosses over, that's very flattering. It's cool to know that with people listening to rock and rap, I'm sitting on their iPods along with that stuff.","There's always gonna be guys who are just wonderful singers and probably shouldn't be writing songs. Then there's always gonna be guys who move up the ranks writing. I don't know what's healthier or what's the best thing - probably whatever yields the best songs."],"Luke Combs":["I'm an honest dude, not trying to be anything other than who I am.","I've always been a 'small goals' kind of guy.","Sometimes people are looking for, 'What's the next Tesla car? What's this really cool, super-specific thing that people are going to want?' But I try to be just like a Ford truck. They sell a lot more Ford trucks than they do Tesla cars.","When I picked up guitar, it wasn't like, 'OK, I'm going to be Kenny Chesney.' It was like, 'I want to play a chord,' and then it was like, 'I want to play another one, then play a song, then sing while playing the song.'","I could play a gig on the moon and not be nervous about it.","I've always been a super regular guy.","If I can reach the guy in Alabama that hunts, and he hears that song, and he sees me - like, he's comfortable with me, my image as a person, as an artist - he's willing to sit down and give that song a chance.","I'm a student of Eric Church, and I say that a lot... I was drawn to it because of the honesty and because it's got rough edges on it. He doesn't shy away from anything, and that's the way I wanted to be.","I don't want to put myself in any kind of a box as far as my sound goes, because being an artist is fluid. If you look at a painter's work, a lot of times, it's similar in style, but other times - over even a year's period - it can change so much. I'm just going with the flow.","I just love writing songs and singing them. People seem to enjoy them, and that's all you can really ask for. I didn't get into it to try to be a celebrity or whatever.","I think there's kind of a comfortability with me onstage - and I think my cool factor is not having one. I'm not extra cool or extra different.","When I go into a room to write, it's like I'm not trying to say, 'I need to write a song that sounds like Eric Church or Jason Aldean.' I just try to get the best song that's in the room that day. Whatever style or sound that may be, I'm not afraid to attack it at that angle.","I do gravitate towards the sad songs because I find them to be more of a challenge for me from a writing perspective. There are things about those songs that do touch people in a way that a fun song can't.","I've been singing my entire life. The guitar came to me later on down the road."],"Luke Davies":["If there's one thing I've written that could survive into posterity, I'd want that to be the poetry.","That's why actors are so great and why they earn so much money. They take away the anxious necessity to find the right words.","The experience of watching great cinema - great art - is life enriching and spiritually uplifting no matter whether it's about as difficult as it gets, like 'Breaking the Waves,' or as light as it gets, like 'Jerry Maguire,' 'Election' or 'Toy Story.'","I was a weird kid. It wasn't until I saw 'Aguirre: The Wrath of God' at 16 that my whole world changed. The obsession with that was equal to the obsession with writing.","Being the writer is merely control freak level two. You've got to get to control freak level one.","The only films that really matter to me are the ones where there are characters whose interactions are moving.","Without Deborah Harry, there's no Madonna; there's no Lady Gaga and beyond. There was something that she did that was very new and powerful in pop, and she was responsible for a change in the way the world acted.","Drawing on real life is what novelists do. It's not the same as reconstructing real life, which is what historians do.","I liked school. I was happy enough there, I think."],"Luke Donald":["I'm probably an average hitter, at least, and if you talk to my peers, they will tell you that I hit the ball plenty far enough.","It will be a great story when I'm an old man telling my grandkids that I was once the best player in the world.","I'm sure people see me as quiet and someone who keeps things to himself a little bit. I might be quiet, but there's a lot of fire inside me, and hopefully people see that sometimes.","I am not a bomber. I'm more about precision and being target-oriented. I have to rely on all parts of my game firing if I'm going to win.","There is more to the game than hitting it far. There are ways to make birdies other than hitting 350-yard drives. I pride myself on a good short game; I work very hard at it.","I'm not a 'big picture' sort of guy. I prefer making small improvements each day.","Chicago is fun. We've spent a lot of time there, about 15 years. My wife's parents and family live in Chicago, so that's a big selling point.","I've never played the Olympic Club. I have played Lytham, but only some amateur events. I haven't played Kiawah.","Dad was certainly a free spirit and had his own ways. He was very proud of my golf achievements but more proud of the person I've turned into. He brought me up to lead a very balanced life.","The message I really want to get out there is that I'm someone who works hard, gets the most out of his talent, off the course has a great family life.","I'm sick at myself for not winning more. But I am always trying to find ways to make myself a better player. I am not just turning up to make up the numbers.","From my own point of view, I went to college in the States. I am very comfortable on the PGA Tour. I have made my family life over there. It would be a big upheaval for me to play full time in Europe, which is why I have decided that I am going to play mostly in the U.S. but still support Europe when it is possible.","My objective has always been to get better, no matter where my ranking is.","The majors are very important, and I would love to win one or many. I'll continue to compete in them hard and win if I can. There's not much more I can say. I'd love to be part of the club of people who've won majors."],"Luke Evans":["For your own self-respect and sanity, your creative freedom, you have to be careful that you don't rely too much on other people's opinions of what you do because it can stunt and inhibit you.","I'm not a 'Twilight' boy; I'll never be as good looking as those lads, and that's fair enough.","A guy's biggest style mistake is definitely trying to look too cool. As long as you've got a good pair of jeans, a good pair of boots and a few good shirts, you're fine.","Living in New Zealand, it's like a different world - it is a different world. It's very, very cool.","I always find cardio the most monotonous. Running on a treadmill shows me why hamsters are so crazy.","I really loved 'Fast Five.' I thought it was a brilliant movie. I thought it was so well done, well directed. The action sequences were really well thought out. It looked fantastic.","You never get over an ex, but you learn to live with it.","The gym is somewhere you can go to just forget for an hour what you do for a living, what you are doing on a daily basis. You just turn up and get on with it.","My trainer is with me all day. We train before I come to work, and then I just keep training all day.","Wales is blessed with some truly magnificent castles, full of history and a must see for visitors.","I look in the mirror, and I don't mind what I see.","If you decide you want to work in the film industry, you just have to bite the bullet and take other jobs until the proper jobs come in.","I come from a country that lives and breathes rugby, and I didn't think there would be anywhere else in the world that could be the same. But New Zealand takes it to another dimension. It's extraordinary how much passion Kiwis have for the game.","Vampires were always able to transform into creatures of the night. The dark creatures like bats have always been associated with vampires and using the darkness to their own advantage.","My mother did like to make clothes, and in I think the worst picture I've ever seen of myself - I must have been eight or nine - she'd dressed me in a matching t-shirt and Bermuda shorts ensemble which I think looked like somebody had thrown up all over it. I was so glad when that sewing machine stopped working, I have to say.","Costume is a massive thing. I think costume makes you stand differently.","One funny thing is, though, I wear my watch on my right hand and I'm actually right-handed. People always wonder why - I don't know myself, I've just always done it that way and I like it the way a good watch fits on my right wrist.","British actors are renowned for being great villains in movies, like Bond films, all the rest of it.","I come from the countryside. I come from a bunch of horticulture family members. My best friend was a farmer's boy.","I think every role you take on, you should take on the responsibility of doing the best representation of that person or that character or that role. When it is a human being that has actually existed, and it is a person that people know of, yeah, you feel an even more amount of pressure to do a good job.","The fascination for the Great Train Robbery has never diminished.","I'm not one of those superstitious people.","I've had some pretty awful jobs that I don't miss, like working on a nightclub door, or compiling VIP lists at 3 A.M. in the morning, but sometimes it's just got to be done.","I've always had quite long canines. It's a very strange thing. My parents don't have them.","Before the 'Fast & Furious' promo in Manila, I went on a vacation in the Philippines 10 years earlier. I loved it. My 'Miss Saigon' friends showed me around.","I don't comment on other people's opinion.","Everybody knows about Peter Jackson, 'The Hobbit' movies and 'The Lord of the Rings' films being made in New Zealand, and to actually have been part of it for such a long period, to live there and to have friends that I will have for life because of that experience, is an amazing thing.","Basically, Apollo was more of a mediator between Zeus in Olympus and Perseus on Earth. He played much more of an active role.","I was often looked at as a leper by kids at school because I was a Jehovah's Witness. They didn't like it - you were 'weird'. And on Saturday mornings, you'd be knocking at their doors. I remember standing there with my mum and dad, thinking, 'Oh my God, I know whose door this is, and I'll have to see them on Monday.' It was terrible.","It's just hard to get an independent film made.","To me, growing up in South Wales, a pair of Diesel jeans were the thing to have - if you could afford them.","Good suits don't come from anywhere, though - I mainly wear Armani, Louis Vuitton and Burberry.","I think sandals should be burnt. I hate them - purge them!","I always wanted to sing, as a child.","When I left school, I got a job in a shoe shop and I used to save 15 quid a week and pay for my own singing and acting lessons.","I felt alive when I read a script and acted out a scene, or sang a song. It was my dream. I'm just very lucky that I'm still doing it and able to earn a living from it.","And I knew that, being an actor, you have to take the rough with the smooth and the highs with the lows. That's how it is.","Most men have an insecurity of some sort. But we're brought up to believe that we can't show them.","And I love to cook! I've impressed hundreds of women with my cooking. And they always come back for more.","In 10 years, I'd love to live near the sea, in a warmer climate. I could see myself with three dogs... and it'd be great to share them with someone else.","There are certain films you want to see on the big screen.","I have seen 'Fast Six,' and it's awesome.","People want to hear your stories about these wonderful experiences you have, and that's what press tours are for.","Directing is something I've sort of always felt like I'd like to do at one point, and I thought the best way to start it is to write something myself or with someone and I'd go from there. My own material.","I guess once you've been acting for a long time, you glean the great bits of good directors and the bad bits from other directors, and you know the way that you would like to be directed.","There's a lot of directors who were actors, so they have the sensibility of an actor, which sometimes helps.","I don't see enough theatre.","Gemma Arterton in 'The Master Builder' at the Almeida - she was absolutely brilliant. Ibsen is difficult and quite hard to follow, but she just brings the stage to life.","Miranda Kerr is absolutely lovely.","You have to have a lot of money to go to college. It's not cheap.","The percentage of people that go to drama college in the U.K. is probably just like anywhere in the world. It's a very hard business to work in. They say that, at any one time, there's only 5% of actors in the world that are actually working and getting paid, which is a shocking percentage, really.","In theater, you sometimes can only do one or two jobs a year because they're long periods. In film, you can shoot so many. It's quite interesting.","The Sixties was all about style and a certain look. But what was interesting about 1963 was that it was pre-Beatles, so the clothes of that time, especially the suits, were very different from the clothes post-Beatlemania.","Voices are always a challenge. I always have to work at each accent I do.","I understand, certain scenes have to have a lot of takes. As an actor, I think it's quite nice to have a handful of takes, because you don't want to do it once or twice; I think once or twice sometimes is quite terrifying because you don't really feel like you've given them what you want.","It was never really part of my plan to be in films; it was really sort of a dream.","I don't necessarily pay extreme attention to what I wear on a daily basis, but I do love to wear something special for an important occasion or when I feel happy.","My style is determined by the mood, the period and the circumstances which I'm going through in a given moment.","When you get to work with people like Ian McKellen or directors like Peter Jackson, you sit and watch.","I research the role, and if it's a literary character, I read the book, and if it's an historical figure, I research documents and biographies. If it's a fictional character, I work off the script.","'The Desolation of Smaug' stands alone as an action/adventure epic movie. It's visually stunning, and the 3D is incredible. Plus, it's directed by Peter Jackson, and he's extraordinary.","I'd like to make a film musical. That's really my dream.","I would love to be able to tap dance.","From the big mountains in the north to the valleys in the south, all through my childhood and teenage years, my family would always holiday in Wales.","I've dabbled in period films in my career, and I've enjoyed each one.","I certainly didn't want to make another movie that's 'just another Dracula film.'","It is a very beautiful story, 'The Crow.' It is a very tragic story with huge emotional themes.","I used to take my car and go down to the South Island for five or six days and climb glaciers and jump out of planes and jump off bridges and go white water rafting - a bit of thrill-seeking.","It was very weird because for a long time no one really recognised me from my films, but 'The Hobbit' has totally changed that, and I've had some really special moments, especially with youngsters.","Most of the time, you do films and they can be big films, but you are rarely aware of the fan base that comes with it.","One thing Tolkien does incredibly well - and this is from a lay person's point of view; I am not scholar or anything - is that you don't have to make an effort to envisage the worlds that he writes about.","A longbow takes a massive draw for the arrow to go anywhere.","I feel that New Zealand is my second home.","When I'm training hard, the diet is miserable.","In all honesty, I should have given up this acting lark years ago.","Being involved in 'The Hobbit' has been a huge boost for me. It's really put me on the map and helped me be taken more seriously as an actor.","I wouldn't say being in a film with The Rock was 'motivating.' 'Terrifying' would be a more accurate description.","It's good for your body to have a break. Even when you're training, you have to have a cheat day every week. The body reacts better to training if you give it intervals of not training, or you relax the diet."],"Luke Ford":["Looking back, I wince at the careless way I tossed out my opinions.","One in 150 kids is autistic these days. The autism spectrum is growing.","My habit of glorifying things far away in space and time, also contributed to my social isolation.","I learned from my Adventist upbringing that the biggest sins were sexual.","I teethed on books of heroes such as Winston Churchill, Abraham Lincoln and King David.","The Seventh Day Adventist Church believes that it was specially chosen by God to prepare the world for the Second Coming of His Son Jesus.","I knew in my gut that there was something wrong with a system that couldn't fire its incompetents, and I had my share of incompetent college teachers.","With 'The Mummy' it was a fantasy action adventure. You get taken away for a few hours and come out and feel revamped and ready to go into the world and enjoy your next day at work.","At times during high school and college I wished to be a sportswriter.","Acting in anger and hatred throughout my life, I frequently precipitated what I feared most, the loss of friendships and the need to rely upon the very people I'd abused.","I loved history, particularly of the British, American and Old Testament kind.","I believed that English-speaking people had a divine mission to civilize the world by making it western, democratic and Christian.","I did not want to reject religion as nonsense because life seemed to have no ultimate purpose without it, and most of the good people I knew were Christians.","I've often thought that my lack of intimacy with those around me is the fault of those around me.","In my right-wing politics of the time, I held that unemployment was usually the fault of the unemployed.","At the time I perceived most religious men, particularly the pastors with all their talk about love, faith and relationship, as effeminate.","I decided to take God and organized religion seriously, and to reject the secular life which in my teens had looked attractive because it allowed me to act in any way that I wanted.","I have decided to follow in my sinful ways, and have largely abandoned the increasingly religious life I was leading over the previous months, including several hours of Talmudic study a day.","I now attend non-orthodox synagogues, and study little during the secular week.","Judaism is much more communal, and partly as a consequence of my religious switch, I am increasingly more suspicous of my previous view that what people do in the privacy of their own home is their business alone.","Everything we do affects other people.","I'm one of the guys who wants to watch the film completely done, with special effects, sound and music, because I tend to get disappointed if I watch it not fully done.","I'm not jumping into anything fast. I'm an actor that likes to choose my work and there's an element of good taste to my work.","I've had horror movies thrown at me and I just don't want to do any because violence isn't really good for society.","If 'Black Balloon' had come out before 'The Mummy,' casting agents wouldn't have been able to see me for the first time in 'The Mummy.' But now that 'The Mummy' has come out before 'The Black Balloon,' that's a very good combination.","The thing about me is I have a great little acting school. I teach about 125 students.","Whether you do a play in front of 100 people or a movie that one billion people see, you're still affecting people."],"Luke Goss":["When I look in the mirror, I never see a handsome chap or the person people think I am.","I'm a gamer. I play PlayStation all the time.","As far as trucks, the great thing about a Range Rover is if you're going out for a dinner, even a black tie event, you can take the Range Rover.","I'm very uncomfortable about the way I look but confident as a man.","I need to be agile because I do all my own stunts.","For a boy or girl, driving cars that they love is fun.","I love as you come into Paris, you've got the Arch de Triomphe and all that crazy traffic. Then I love the drive from Paris down to Antibes and you veer off east in through the Alps and you come into the south of France on the mountain road as opposed to the freeway.","I love film. I am very blessed to be making movies.","When a man has written a role for you that you admire, the expectations are higher.","I think sex appeal is something that's fun. But I'd guess any man with any conscious consideration or understanding of his own sex appeal is one of the least sexy men you might meet.","I think woman is phenomenal, magnificent. I mean that sincerely.","My grandfather was a faith healer and medium, and he always encouraged faith in the unseen. I believe in fortune tellers.","Danny Trejo is so bloody cool, I mean, he can just stand there and look cool.","I am quite a physical chap - I think that's why my waist and physique are pretty much the same as when I was a kid, although my chest is a lot bigger."],"Luke Grimes":["I'm not really a fan of organized religion.","It's really odd to be up close to an icon like Bruce Willis. You're used to seeing him on a screen, 50 feet tall. To think, 'Hmm, I'm taller than you are' is just weird.","I don't really invest too much in the future."],"Luke Harding":["I first visited Kurdistan in 2003. I arrived in the town of Sulaimaniyah, courtesy of smugglers who drove me across the border from Iran. Sulaimaniyah was a small, charming provincial Kurdish town.","When I first began visiting West Germany in the early 1980s, I was startled by the contrast between Birmingham, where I went to school, and affluent Cologne. My host family, the lovely Schumachers, always had an opulent array of grapes on the table; they were better dressed than anyone I knew in Britain.","Under the Assads, Kurds were forbidden from learning their own language at school, or even from speaking it in the military. The result is a generation of Syrian Kurds, many now in late middle age, who can't write their own language.","Notionally a left-wing movement, the Anti-Germans were born after the collapse of the Berlin wall. While most Germans rejoiced at the end of the Cold War, the Anti-Germans feared that a united Germany might lead to a fourth Reich - and a return of anti-Semitism.","Snowden was extremely good at digital self-defense. When he was employed by the C.I.A. and N.S.A., one of his jobs was to teach U.S. national security officials and C.I.A. employees how to protect their data in high-threat digital environments.","The FSB's invisible presence continued; the agency became an intangible part of my Moscow life - sometimes loudly, sometimes quietly, with someone in a back room clearly turning the volume of minor persecution up and down.","By August 2008, we had left Voikovskaya and moved into a wooden dacha in the artists' colony of Sokol in north-west Moscow. The house was a haven amid the madness of the city: lily of the valley grew near our front gate, Virginia creeper decked the green picket fence.","On 30 June 2010, the FSB broke into my office again. They unplugged the Internet, opened the window and left the phone off the hook, placing it next to my laptop. The message was clear: we are still here.","My four years in Russia end, then, in dramatic fashion: with a textbook Soviet-style expulsion. I am the first western staff correspondent to suffer this fate since the end of the Cold War. I'm stunned. But my expulsion is not, I reflect, a surprise. It's something I have always accepted as a real, if far-fetched, possibility.","There is a long dishonourable tradition of western intellectuals who have been duped by Moscow. The list includes Bernard Shaw, the Webbs, H. G. Wells, and Andre Gide.","My journalistic mission was straightforward: to await the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Nobody knew quite when this would be. But the diplomacy - the meetings in the U.N. security council, the allegations about weapons of mass destruction, the martial language of Tony Blair and George W. Bush - all suggested a war was brewing.","I left Kurdistan in April 2003 with the peshmerga, following their excited advance as Saddam's forces crumbled. First Kirkuk, then Mosul - where looters broke into the city museum and seized its Parthian sculptures - then Tikrit. I reported from Baghdad in month-long stints until the end of 2004.","Two decades after communism and the alleged end of the Cold War, Russia is still a cash economy. The preferred currency is dollars, though euros are also acceptable.","Germany's hierarchical reverence for seniority may have something to do with the fact that everything here happens relatively late. Germans start school at six, graduate in their late 20s, and get their first proper jobs in their 30s. Adolescence can go on a long time. It is rare for anyone to achieve responsibility before their 50s.","Taking your clothes off in front of strangers is something of a hobby in Germany, among both men and women, especially in the former communist East, where it was one of the few freedoms allowed.","Strict shopping laws mean that most German shops close on Saturday afternoons, reopening only on Monday when everybody is back at work."],"Luke Hemsworth":["I've seen sharks in the ocean, it hasn't made me get out of the ocean; that's for sure.","My head is massive. My head is, like, off the charts.","I don't think most people decide to become an actor because they want to be followed around all the time... I see it when I'm with my brothers, and I don't get it. I don't understand why someone wants to take a photo of us getting out of a car or on the beach. I think that's really weird.","I could probably live in London if you had better surf."],"Luke Kirby":["I believe in love at first sight, and I feel sometimes you have to just be open to whatever love is and let yourself fall.","Yeah, I think on my resume it still says that - that I can juggle.","But with woodworking, it's really sort of gratifying to be able to have an actual piece to touch, and then step back and be able to share it.","Yeah, I do get to do some theater occasionally. I don't get to do it as much as I would like to.","I have been taking some classes in woodworking. It's really helpful just looking at a problem, and having a very tangible way in constructing it.","I'm a drama nerd."],"Luke Mably":["I'm a typical guy. Driving cars and speed are really fun.","I like playing heavy metal music and pretending I'm a vampire in front of the mirror.","That's why I enjoy acting: getting in the mind of someone else.","I steal things from people, characteristics, and I just stock them in my head like a library to use for characters in the future."],"Luke Macfarlane":["Gay marriage - it's not about two people being gay: it's about two people who love each other and who have decided to commit to each other for the exact same reasons any other couple would get married.","After three years in L.A., I began to dream of my glory days on the boards. But it's very difficult to make a living as a theater actor in New York, which is why I moved out here, and I always had an ambition to work in television. I am a great admirer of the format, and I think it's how we tell long stories.","I always like to start with a great pair of shoes. It's your first contact with the ground, and it can really change the way you move and act physically.","Juxtaposition is interesting to me.","I live in a craftsman house, but I'm a big fan of modernist and mid-century furniture and architecture, too. But my dream is to do a truly original chair design, something that is all these different things but is my own, too.","I think the first table read I ever did, my hand was vibrating the whole time.","I think, like most actors, it's really exciting to be challenged.","Most important, in portraying gay people... it's just like portraying anybody else.","The thing about watching a show about the Iraq war, especially for an American audience, is that it reminds them they're responsible in some way.","I don't think a lot of the news outlets examine the effect of war on a family.","I was in a band when I was in high school, and I was bitten by the performance bug, if anything else.","I had this notion that maybe I wanted to be an actor... I thought it might be a neat career. I thought if I was going to try that, I should shoot for the best, and I auditioned for Julliard.","There's a kind of integrity to being an observer of a culture. I think Canadians have that privilege innately. We are, like, the observers of the American culture.","There are very few things that 13 million people tune in to witness, so television is a really relevant and powerful thing.","I've always actually taken very good care of body.","Growing up, one of the shows that the entire family ate dinner at the table was 'Star Trek: The Next Generation.' That was one of the greatest television shows ever, and then I'm a fan of 'Firefly.'"],"Luke Mitchell":["At one point in time or another, everyone's an outcast, and you have to deal with those sort of issues in society. Especially for teenage kids, I don't think there's anyone that's really been through childhood and not been an outcast in one way or another.","Considering the 'Tomorrow People' are supposed to be the next step in human evolution, I think it's a fascinating idea that they can't kill. They've evolved in all these other ways, and they have these special abilities, but they can't kill. It's a very interesting concept. I really like it. I like the idea of it.","I think every character I play definitely has parts of me. I can't ever play someone that's completely different to me.","I never did drama at school. I did it for one term, when it was compulsory, and I hated it. Tennis was the main thing in my life, and I was not open to anything else. When I removed tennis from the equation, I didn't know who I was.","My favorite group growing up was 'The Hobbit.' It was the first book I actually finished. One of those adventure things that takes you to that land and it will forever hold a special place in my heart. I am not a huge book reader.","I have quite an eclectic taste in music. I like Angus & Julia Stone; they are an Australian brother/sister duo. I like Adele. She is phenomenal.","I do weights and work out different body parts on different days. I don't do cardio - I did too much in my tennis-playing days!","I got to a stage where tennis was the only thing in my life, and I didn't like that.","I try to stay away from processed foods. I eat lean meats and get as many veggies as I can on my plate, so when mum calls me on a Sunday, I can tell her I'm eating enough veggies! I love pasta, but I don't eat carbs a whole lot, and I love fruit."],"Luke Nosek":["There would really be no reason to get up in the morning if Founders Fund was not willing to invest in companies that were doing important things, great businesses that very few people believe in.","If genetic research doesn't seemed to have lived up to its therapeutic promise, it's because sequencing is just too slow and expensive.","With Halcyon's technology, the pool of genetic information will grow by orders of magnitude in the course of months, offering the first real chance at cures for cancer and other previously intractable diseases.","Ultimately Halcyon needs the greatest scientists and engineers in the world to succeed in its mission.","Halcyon people have put aside and left their homes, their million dollar salaries, full professorships at major universities, and fully seed-funded startup companies to be part of this effort.","I have realised more and more that great companies, founded for a long-term purpose, such as Google or Facebook or SpaceX, may do more good in the world than any other vehicle that we have.","We had a mission at PayPal - which was to create a new financial system, a new world currency, and we failed. We were a financial success, but we didn't succeed at the purpose of our company.","As I became a venture capitalist, it's almost like I went to the dark side for a while.","What we believe at Founders Fund is that technology is a way to help everybody on the planet.","We believe SpaceX will become the world leader in space transport, and we want our investors to be part of that future."],"Luke Pasqualino":["When it comes to dating, I'm straightforward and traditional with a twist.","Pretty good, you know it's nice when you get people coming up to you saying 'Can I have a photo or an autograph'; it's a compliment, I think.","I speak a little bit of Italian, yeah. I understand more than I speak. I speak more of a dialect; my mum's from Naples and my dad's from Sicily, so it comes out little a bit of a cocktail of the Italian language.","You can't steal every scene. There are scenes in which you need to sit back and do a lot less, verbally, physically.","I've always liked food, and I've always been interested in cooking and stuff like that.","So many people are are using the Internet now to watch movies and TV shows online.","Any project that you shoot, it's never going to be completely finished the way that... I don't think I've ever worked on anything where every scene has been kept in the order that it was originally in, or that it hasn't been cut down in some way.","That's where the theatre of dreams is, over in L.A.; it's the land of opportunity for actors, and to go over there with a good team behind you and have a part you want to audition for really makes it a joy.","My first real acting job was 'Skins' at eighteen years old, and I just kind of grew into myself in those two years; I would have done terribly if I'd have got that job at sixteen.","The recognition thing started to happen in 2009 when 'Skins' season three had come out and we were on TV. It used to happen much more when we were in the height of our success, but I never really saw it as a chore or anything like that. It was just quite exciting - you had fans.","My cousin owns restaurants, and I used to work in his restaurants with his chef. I've always liked food, and I've always been interested in cooking and stuff like that.","I did enjoy cooking, I still do really enjoy cooking - I make a nice salmon dish, and I'm a huge meat freak, so I love to bang a few steaks on the grill or pasta. Anything Italian, really.","In my opinion, the BBC are one of the best producers of drama in the world, and it made me incredibly happy to get the opportunity to be one of the leading men in one of their productions.","I suppose if I did get into a situation with a friend where we both liked the same girl, I like to think we'd sit down maturely and decide who was going to get in there, and then the other would stand aside.","When I was 16 the first girl I had a crush on wasn't interested at all. I liked her from afar for ages, and when I eventually got the courage and told her, and she wasn't into me.","I don't think I've ever properly been in love. I've had a few girlfriends and have liked them loads, but I'm not sure it was love.","I like a girl that takes pride in her appearance - looks are important to me, but it's also important she gets on with my friends and family. If my parents don't like a girl, then she's instantly a no-go.","I remember everyone in my nursery school class getting a carton of milk before the day started. Only, I got mine about 20 minutes later than everyone else because it had to be kept on the radiator for a short while. I liked warm milk when I was small.","I wouldn't let anyone say a bad word about Cheryl Cole.","Normally, when I read a script, I read 30 pages, and then go have a cup of tea and come back. And then, I read 20 pages and go make a phone call, and then go back to it.","I was quite young when I went to a drama workshop. I was around 9 or 10. I showed interest in it. I never saw it as a career. At around 16, I knew what I wanted to do."],"Luke Perry":["When I was a kid, I was at a bowling alley and I ran into a soda machine. I still have the scar on my right eyebrow obviously.","I was something of a prankster. One time I put a ski mask on my head and used a fake gun on the school secretary so that I could get some of my friends out of detention.","I always felt like something of an outsider. But I identified with people up on the screen. That made me feel like I wanted to be up on the screen too. I felt like eventually I would get there.","It's hard and sometimes it's scary. It still amazes my mother. I went home for Christmas one year and there were fans all over the front lawn, hoping to see me.","I've had tons of odd jobs, but I think that I would probably be a fireman because you get to see the results of your job. You get there and there is a house on fire. You leave and there's not a fire anymore.","I have a girlfriend, but I don't really want to talk about her. I won't name her. She isn't in show business, has nothing to do with it. So I'd rather just keep her out of it.","I think that sometimes kids use the show as a jumping off point for talking about things with their parents.","It was a fun film. I had a great time doing it. I was looking for a role just like that for my first movie role. I didn't want to have a starring role, because I wanted a chance to learn. I didn't want the whole thing riding on me.","I open to anything... just about anything.","Growing up in the Midwest, people don't drive Porsches and Ferraris. They drive Fords and Chevys. And so even if you have the opportunity to buy a more expensive car, it doesn't occur to you because it's not what you relate to.","I go four- wheeling in my truck. I also like to fish, cook, do stuff around my house. I even studied fencing for awhile.","My high school was nothing like West Beverly High, let me tell you. I grew up in Fredericktown, Ohio.","I knew that I was going to do Westerns. I like 'em.","There's a big difference between me and a real, legitimate working hand, or a world-champion rodeo cowboy. I play 'em, and I aspire to be like that, but those guys are tough.","When I was a kid, I just devoured TV 24 hours a day. Now that it's actually available 24 hours a day, I'm usually busy doing other stuff. But I do watch TV when I can.","Why doesn't Apple stop for a year and make medical devices? When people talk about technology, that's where I start to get a little hot under the collar because I know that it's the key to solving some of the world's biggest problems. Having a faster, thinner telephone is not one of the world's biggest problems.","I don't think what I have to say is that important.","I'm not much of a matchmaker. I think people have to make their own choices and mistakes and all that stuff."],"Luke Rhinehart":["Those who believe that they have absolute truth and the only moral system are destructive both to themselves and to those whom they try to convert.","In 1965, I was teaching a seminar on freedom when I told my students that the ultimate freedom lay in casting a dice to decide what to do. They were so shocked and fascinated that I knew I had to write the book.","When I was a young man, barely 18, I discovered Jesus Christ as my personal saviour, and for six months I told my mother she was damned to hell. That wasn't much fun. I abandoned it.","The thing the Buddhists and the Sufis have in common is a belief that religious certainties are destructive.","Part of the philosophy of 'The Dice Man' is that you have got to be laughing at yourself at every moment and be free of yourself at every moment.","I am George Cockcroft. But when I come to England or Europe, where the name Luke Rhinehart is better known, then I use that name.","'The Dice Man' is an anti-establishment cult novel, and you don't normally make studio films from such dark comedy material."],"Luke Richardson":["We need to change the culture of this topic and make it OK to speak about mental health and suicide.","I would be surprised if there weren't some owners who didn't want to get a deal done right now and get back to playing hockey.","We decided to speak publicly about suicide because we wanted to make a difference in other people's lives."],"Luke Roberts":["Conflict is good in a negotiation process... it's the clash of two ideas, which then, all being well, produces a third idea.","It's nice to sort of walk in and at least create the illusion that you are, or your character is, a well-rounded human being, a complete person. Especially when you're playing these impressive, high-functioning professionals. You feel like you have to come in sort of guns blazing.","Playing the greatest warrior in the seven kingdoms, that's absolutely no pressure.","I grew up on courtroom dramas, and I really love the feel of a dramatic thriller.","I don't think I'm a particularly good negotiator.","I enjoy a good reasoned argument. I love the power of logic.","I was quite intrigued by the idea of following the exploits of people who are often in the margins.","Playing the greatest warrior in the seven kingdoms, that's absolutely no pressure. It didn't help, during the casting, the director kept saying, 'Remember, you're the most legendary swordsman ever.' I said, 'Great. I'll try and convey that in my four lines of dialogue.'","What I've learned is that the clearer the creative vision, the clearer the idea for the show, the easier it is to rally your partners around what you're doing.","I was quite intrigued by the idea of following the exploits of people who are often in the margins. You see the negotiators, but it's usually the SWAT team or the tactical team that draw our eye.","I give everything far too much thought. If you think you know what you're doing, then you can kind of relax, and then you can improvise and play and just enjoy the day rather than be chasing the lines.","'Game of Thrones' has kind of got the Midas touch, certainly for the lead actors and those recurring guest stars. It's the show that can do no wrong because it's so well produced. My contribution is short, but I think, in my mind, it was sweet because it involved such elaborate scenes."],"Luke Scott":["We all have the right of freedom of speech under the First Amendment. We all don't have to agree with one another on our opinions. Everyone in my circle, that I run around with, we all feel the same about God, country, integrity and character.","Gun control means control. It means control for the government and the government starts controlling the people.","Crime is actually less in places where people own guns. Washington, D.C., is a case in point. It has the strictest gun laws, but who has the highest crime rate in the country? Washington, D.C.","I believe God created sports for a good reason. It's recreation. It's something that we enjoy. It teaches us a lot as well... I believe God is a sports fan.","You know, I've carried a weapon for 10 years, never shot anybody, never robbed anybody. It has saved my life twice, but I know they're not toys. I practice with firearms, I enjoy shooting, it's a hobby of mine and I have a healthy respect for them.","I rely on guns for protection in life. God does not say, 'This is la-la land.' God doesn't say, 'Welcome to Earth. Everything's perfect. There's no crime. There's no murder. There's no death.' The world is imperfect, and you have to be on guard.","We have good security. It's hard to get in here. Barring a tactical entry where terrorists come in and hold us hostage, that's about the only thing that could possibly warrant me carrying a gun in the clubhouse. That's highly unlikely, and I admit that. But my personal belief is I don't want to suffer from the poor choices of others.","I asked myself, 'What are you going to do with your life? Are you going to be like everyone else or are you going to do what's right?' I just made a decision. I said, 'It's time to grow up. It's time to start living for the Lord, do things the right way.' I accepted the Lord, and it changed my life.","Obama does not represent America. Nor does he represent anything what our forefathers stood for. This country is basically built on an attitude. It's a way of life. It's not because you're born here. It's not that you're supposed to take from those who have and give to those who haven't. That kills a country. It killed Russia.","You can see my guns at my apartment. The safe room is a special place... It's good to have a safe room in your house. It's storm-proof; we've got food, store supplies, all kinds of stuff.","The real issue behind these people who are gun grabbers, the truth is - based on fact - the reason why is, they want control. They want control of the people. That's what socialism is and communism.","If someone accuses me of not being born here, I can go -within 10 minutes - to my filing cabinet and I can pick up my real birth certificate and I can go, 'See? Look! Here it is. Here it is.'","I am not politically correct. I am all about the facts, I am all about the truth and I am all about Godly pursuits and what this country was built on, and I am not apologetic about it.","I've carried a gun for 10 years. I've carried them in the locker room, and nobody really knows about it. I know how to handle myself, and I stow it away where nobody really knows about it.","Our forefathers got it; they got it, man. They took godly principles and they put them into action, and they developed our Constitution - the land of freedom where each man is accountable and responsible for his actions.","I think what the Tea Party movement is - I'm all for it; they're out there fighting for our rights, fighting for what our forefathers stood for.","If living by these sets of morals and principles and wanting to help better my land, better my country, my community, my team, my environment and helping the next person help themselves, if that's considered crazy, then I'm a crazy.","There's a lot of people that fought for their country and that's not something to be taken lightly. They gave their life, everything they had, they gave their lives, to give us what we have. That's why I'm so passionate about my beliefs - because someone died.","There's no one here in America swimming the Pacific Ocean - or the Atlantic, or the Caribbean - to leave this place. The reason why is because of the freedom. Freedom for a man to mark out his own destiny. It's not, 'Hey, you have so much.'","You cannot trust 25 guys in a locker room to have the same respect and training as I do with a weapon. That I do understand. I've carried a gun for 10 years. I've carried them in the locker room, and nobody really knows about it. I know how to handle myself.","An athlete gets paid a lot of money. And someone who is after that, a thief, a mugger or someone who steals from people, they are taking a chance with the law that if they get caught, they are going to jail or face some other problem. In my case, you are going to get shot.","How do you combat a man with a firearm? You don't combat him with a golf club, baseball bat or a knife. You combat him with another firearm.","In the Bible it says God has made everything good for man to eat and to wear their skins. Whenever we eat beef, we eat chicken, we have to kill to eat. But at the same time, hunting is a sport. I think it is a great sport... I would say most hunters are Christian men."],"Luke Treadaway":["London is full of creative people - you can never say that it's not.","I do actually dabble in a bit of poetry! And I'm yet to pen a script, but it is something that I've been telling myself I want to do.","When I was about 7, I fancied Anna Chlumsky; the girl from 'My Girl.'","I used to go to the supermarket dressed as Peter Pan when I was about five years old.","This morning someone sent me a very funny photo of me holding their puppy. We have matching colour jackets.","I can walk on my hands.","If you think, 'I'm jumping out of a plane at 30,000 feet!' you're not going to do it. But if you just jump out, then you'll have an interesting ride.","Other actors don't get asked about their brothers or sisters, so why do I have to always answer questions about having a twin brother? I suppose it's interesting for everybody other than me.","It's not the easiest thing in the world to act with Harry - we are very close. I'm not saying it won't ever happen again but it's best to work with other people. There are no professional boundaries at which to stop when you act with a sibling.","It was great to play an ex-marine cockney thug. All my roles are as different as the colours of the rainbow.","A lot of my mates are actors and it's lovely to be able to work with friends.","It's been too many years since I've played live as myself as opposed to in a fake band for a film.","Maybe there's less oppression growing up in a small village, and fewer rules, and less danger.","I've no grand designs to conquer the music industry, but I'd love to be able to tell my mates that I'm playing in a pub in Camden one night.","I love music, particularly Radiohead, TV on the Radio, The XX and Tribes - they're a great new band from Camden and well worth a look at.","I have started to record some demos so hopefully in the near future I can play live."],"Luke Wilson":["As long as you're getting along, it's nice to work with someone you know well.","Whatever kind of movie it is, you're going to be more into it when you care more about the drama, or you'll have a better laugh if you feel like you know the people better.","That just seems like a tough thing to do... just work in the middle of a company for your entire life. You just do the same thing out of college until you're 60, and then you retire.","Especially with a comedy, you've got the clear cut goal of trying to make a scene funny. It's not like drama where you're trying to achieve some kind of emotion or trying to further the story along. You're trying to figure out what's the funniest way to do something.","I always laugh the hardest at the stuff you see in day-to-day life. It's great when somebody can tell a joke that really makes you laugh hard, but to see some kind of personal interaction that no one could write is so good. Those are always the things that make me laugh.","I'm probably one of the worst people with numbers you've ever met. My brothers always kid that they think I'm counting cards in Vegas, but I'm just trying to add things up.","I like to think I can keep a pretty level head.","That's one of those things that will really hurt me personally, if I label a character or think about what it might do if it were to do well. I just try to do a good job with it.","There definitely is that element of guys who like to party and have a good time and... putting off for as long as possible the idea that they'll actually have to settle down.","The thing about being an actor is that you're in the business of not growing up.","When you're in Los Angeles, nobody bats an eye, they're so used to seeing actors, they just act really cool.","It's always been my personal feeling that unless you are married, there is something that is not very dignified about talking about who you are dating.","I never had to say to myself, 'OK now, I've got to grow up and work for a bank, or go and sell real estate.' I never had to make that kind of break.","I don't really have a type of woman.","As a movie-goer, I really like to watch all different kinds of movies and, as an actor, I always feel like I could do pretty much anything but a musical.","When you do a comedy, the goals are much clearer to me.","I'd always envied actors who got to play real people or got to do research. I've always just had these scripts where, I mean not in a bad way, but it was right on the page.","I'm really just doing whatever comes my way and trying to stay busy and get better at what I'm doing.","It's nice, though, getting older and being able to do different roles.","I've worked on movies that are being rewritten as you go, but you take so long and so much time doing it, that it's not really an issue knowing what's going to happen or how the movie is going to end.","You can get pigeonholed in Hollywood and people think of you in a certain way.","I spent so many years with people saying, 'Hey, you're like America's boyfriend!'","Do men have a biological clock? I feel like I do. Something is definitely ticking!","Sometimes when you get on a new movie you kind of how to figure out the way other people work and it can be like being the new kid in high school where you're just trying to find out where your place is on the movie or on the set.","I just always wanted to stay busy.","I have never, for better or worse, thought about a 'career path' or anything like that.","I like to think I've done a lot of different kinds of roles, but obviously I have done quite a lot of comedies."],"Lulu":["For me, it's more about keeping it simple with a rock and roll edge. It's all about accessorising.","I have a crush on Steve Tyler. He's funny, he rocks, and has a voice like a god. There is another one who I have discovered can sing. I should try and make an album with him... it's Barack Obama!","'Boom Bang a Bang' was a huge part of me, maybe a part that I didn't relish, and there might be psychological reasons for that - I was a child being made to do things I didn't want to do. I was perhaps an elitist, a bit of a snob.","Because I've been around forever and ever, like wallpaper, people ask me for secrets... it's the same with my skin care range; that's out of necessity. As soon as I saw the first signs, I bought everything in the market.","I think it's nice to have children. I didn't have many, and while I don't sit around regretting it, I maybe would have liked a couple more. But it wasn't meant to be, and I didn't want it badly enough.","Self-indulgence is something to watch, but anything that helps you understand situations that are difficult to understand is good. If you're having some sort of emotional trauma, you need to find a person to talk to about it who says, 'This is quite normal; it's fine.'","I feel I have been protected all my life. I am still here, for God's sake, and a lot of my contemporaries have gone. I'm very fortunate. No matter the difficulties - and we all have difficulties - I am definitely one of the fortunate ones. If I have any really good characteristics, one is that I am resilient.","When I'm singing, it's like I'm at home. And music is a great healer. I think I'd have been a basket case if I hadn't been a singer.","I don't want to be left in the past. When I stand next to Kylie, Beyonce or Rihanna, I don't want to be a decrepit old lady.","My mother always told me to take pride in my appearance.","I didn't like any British music before The Beatles. For me, it was all about black American music. But then I became a successful pop singer, even though the kind of music I liked was more elitist, which is what I'm trying to get back to.","For young people, it doesn't matter so much, but when you're older, less is definitely more - too much make-up can give you the 'eccentric Aunt Sally' look!","Time Bomb encapsulates everything I have learned over the years and wished I could find in a capsule collection. It's the absolute best skincare and body products I could envisage - and I am fussy. I am now able to indulge my love of beauty products and call it research.","I am always keen to discover something new, but my advice is always to exfoliate. Get rid of those dead, dry cells; then the new skin is ready for moisturising, and you find your inner dewy, youthful glow. It's in there somewhere.","Because of the shape of my eyes, I can wear a lot of make-up. I can do a smoky look in the evening, but in the day I wear a lot less. Most women don't deal with lip pencils - they have been given a bad name, but are essential, especially as we get older."],"Lupe Fiasco":["People don't understand that where I come from, everyone is either a convict, been in jail, been in a gang, is a hooligan of some sorts, but those are my brothers, my family and the people that I travel with. Those are the people that I roll with.","If you are an open-minded and tolerant Muslim, you have enough knowledge to question the moves of a Christian governor or even the Ku Klux Klan. They called themselves a Christian organization, but how is that possible since Jesus didn't do that?","This nation was founded by rebels and revolutionaries, and its flags were carried across the battlefields by people who were very, very against the status quo and who questioned and criticized.","It definitely wasn't like, 'Hey, I'm going to steal that, and nobody's going to know.' The original 'T.R.O.Y.' came out in 1992, and it was like a 20th anniversary kind of thing. All of those intentions were there for it to be resurrecting a classic for a new generation. I tried to honor it.","What's the biggest commercial for aggression, sexuality and materialism? What gets pumped into these kids' heads? Taking someone else's girl, which is so laissez-faire in hip-hop, will get you killed in the streets, but it doesn't seem to be an issue when you hear it on the radio.","That should be the measure of success for everyone. It's not money, it's not fame, it's not celebrity; my index of success is happiness.","I always saw two sides of life. I saw the dudes who would be the gangsta, big-time guys on the block, but would also be dedicated fathers. It was kind of weird to see that dual story that everybody has.","Faced with the way the system does you in the 'hood sometimes, if you don't literally get out, your chances are slim. You'll definitely die mentally. You'll pretty much die physically.","Reggae, oh man. It's the ultimate music. The positivity. The musicality. The whole cultural expressionism of it. The danceability. Just the cool factor. The melody factor. Some of it comes from a religious place. If there were a competition of who makes the best religious music, it would definitely be the Rastafarian reggae.","True terrorism, you know, weaponized fear. In defense of ourselves, we're fighting - actively fighting something else. But if you're going to fight terrorism, to me, you fight the root causes of terrorism.","We've done shows - we'll be in Dublin, and it will be nonstop pandemonium to the point where you think the crowd is going to implode, because they're making so much noise and they're so excited.","I trust people to be human. Sometimes you do things that make amazing amounts of sense; sometimes you do things that don't make any sense whatsoever.","We have to make the physical music a little more valuable instead of just having a download link and a bunch of songs you downloaded from some torrent site. People try to make the music value-less, and I don't think we're going to stop that train, but the one thing that they can't devalue are things that are in the outside world.","Some people are the greatest people on Earth with good hearts and will get in the studio and make the most negative music in the world for the sake of success. That's what the music business does to you. That's what capitalism does to you.","I think it is important that you have people from all different vanguards, from all different walks of society and different viewpoints to be focused on the struggle for equality and democracy. We need as many champions for the cause and as many events as possible to help keep this in focus.","In Chicago, you have an absence of strong family units, and that absence gets filled by gangs. You have a failure in the school system, after-school programs and other social programs to help keep kids off the streets. Amnesty International speaks to that in some way, by keeping these issues in the forefront.","You know what I had a problem with? The war - the war in Afghanistan.","There's already been black presidents who've been corrupt, so it doesn't strike me that having a black man in office means he's going to be the Messiah.","Before my father would open up a karate school in a particular neighborhood, he'd clean up the block - kick all the drug dealers and gang bangers off the block. My father was very clear: 'I've got guns too, and I'll kill you just as much as a rival gang would.' And he meant it. He was a man of many facets and complexities.","If you want to relate me to the newer cats, let's go. Let's go line for line and bar for bar. If it's all about spitting and metaphors and MCing and lyrics and entendres, I will eat 99 percent of you dudes up.","Barack is at a level where he can't - no matter how much he wants to or how much we want him to - he's not going to come take out our garbage, so to speak. He can't be the garbage man and the president. He can't be the mayor and the alderman. He can't fill all those roles. So I always push for local, local activity on the political scene.","I always preach that you have to be active as a citizen no matter what, and some people just voting as an excuse not to do anything.","Sometimes I do feel hopeless when I look out and scream out through my music, and I scream out through these interviews, and I scream out to people to kind of get their attention back on the things that are meaningful. There's people dying on the streets of Chicago - young people, young men and women who are losing their lives.","I have so many miles and I've been flying for so long that every time I fly, it's first class. It's one of those things that, if I needed to jump on a plane, and fly to Spain tomorrow, I know I could get it done. Just like that.","Oh yeah, I'm literally walking through my house now looking down and there are maybe, like, 15 pairs on the floor. For real. Real talk. It's just simplicity. They're something I wear every day. Before I got a deal with them, I was wearing some type of Vans all the time. I would just order them by the box, like, 10 at a time.","I was born Muslim, but for a large part of my life, I wasn't necessarily raised Muslim. My father always kept everything around us, from Western philosophy to Eastern philosophy.","I can't play any instrument for the life of me, but I know what I want to hear.","I have an understanding of Queen and the way Freddie Mercury did his harmonies. I know what tablas sound like, because my father played a lot of Ustad Ali Akbar Khan.","The story of 'Lasers' is my story. I didn't have to look too far to get subject matter for this record; it was stuff that was happening to me.","360 deals are the new things of the industry. It's not about selling records; it's about selling T-shirts, getting a piece of your publishing, getting a piece of your touring, and all these other kind of properties.","My whole team, it wasn't about putting the album out, it was about getting off the record company and going independent or going to another label. To the point we were like, 'Listen, just take 'Lasers.' You can have whatever percentage off the next ten records I do for the rest of my life. I just do not want to be here anymore.'","I think that American presidents, that position in itself, as well as American foreign policy, it has terrorism in it. CIA agents going to overthrow certain governments - they're using terrorist tactics. They're not going in there like, 'Hey, you wanna have some cake?'","You have educate the masses to exactly what their tax dollars are going to pay for. I think once people educate themselves and open up their minds to understand that on that really basic level, then you'll have some type of change in the way that Americans associate themselves and participate in their own political process.","I don't really get the same kinda romance that I would get from, like, jazz. And even to a lesser extent to rock 'n roll. Rock 'n roll has a romance to it - how can I put it? A very vulgar romance, but still a romance; whereas hip hop has more facade.","I look at people like Picasso and Da Vinci and Escher and Miles Davis, and they'll write or paint that one definitive masterpiece of maybe 50 that they have that's really trying to go outside the box, trying to do something that's tough. And then when you accomplish it, you look back and go, 'Yeeaaaah - masterpiece.'","You know, my goal, once I leave the music business, is like, 'Man, Lupe didn't lead us astray.' It comes directly from Islam: leading people astray is the worst thing you could do. Especially in perpetuity; like, your music continues to go on and live without you. That risk is too great for me; I'm gonna keep it positive.","Chief Keef scares me. Not him specifically, but just the culture that he represents.","I'm trying to fight the terrorism that's actually causing the other forms of terrorism. You know, the root cause of terrorism is the stuff that the U.S. government allows to happen, and the foreign policies that we have in place in different countries that inspire people to become terrorists. And it's easy for us because it's just some oil.","In my fight against terrorism, to me, the biggest terrorist is Obama, and the United States of America.","I think you have to ask yourself does voting work on the level that you are trying to effectuate change; that is the conversation you must have.","All the big revolutions, whether it's the Industrial Revolution, the Arab Spring, those changes happened by economic and social shifts brought about by the people's voices, and those things weren't voted for. Most of our changes today are brought about through technology, not by voting.","I don't mind payin' for the police and for streets and sanitation, or road work, bridges, trains, food subsidies and welfare. But I don't wanna pay for bombs to fight proxy wars in the middle of nowhere against enemies in the night.","It was, 'If you don't do 'The Show Goes On,' your album's not coming out.' I had nothing to do with that record - nothing. I was literally told how I should rap on it. But I'm a bastard, 'cos I'll turn around and put it back in your face.","I don't hate the music, but I hate the process. When I look at it, I don't see song titles and artwork, I see the fight - I see the emotions, the blood, sweat and tears. There are a couple of songs on there that I love; but 'Lasers' is a little bit of what you love, a little bit of what you like, and a lot of what you had to do.","People say, 'If you don't vote, then you don't have a right to say anything. But nine times outta 10, I pay more taxes than they do - so even if I don't vote, I still have the right to speak out.","It's a massive undertaking putting an album together... It's not light weight at all.","Everybody has their opinion on what's 'real,' and what's they choose to listen to and their personal preference. Whether they're 2 years old or 200 years old. And people can listen to whatever they want.","I never want to be an artistic bully, and put myself above anyone else... or be more prestigious than anyone else. You like what you like, and you have to take that as you want it.","I find it somewhat liberating to jump, to dive into things that are the opposite of me.","Da Pak was a group out of Chicago. It was a put-together group. We actually met for the first time at this showcase. They were like 'Yo, you should do a song together.' So we did. It just so happened that the name of the song was 'Wolf Pak.' They said, 'Y'all should be a group called Da Pak, and here's a record deal.'","You expect certain things. You build up in your mind how it's supposed to go down. When you get a record deal, you think you're supposed to get X, Y, and Z. It doesn't happen like that. You're like 'Oh, this isn't as exciting as I thought it was going to be.'","When you start creating opinion, and you start creating difference of opinion, you're doing something. People are actually sitting down and critiquing. A lot of the stuff people hate, they really don't. They only look at the outer shell. They don't really get into it.","I love Obama, and I love the fact that it's a black president of the United States of America, but he's not the first black president. Robert Mugabe is a black president, too, so let's not get to talking about precedents being set.","The economical policies that are instigated really makes you think that the American government is a bunch of evil bastards. So just because you're black, you're still representing that government, and when Obama came into office he enacted the same policies that we would critique other presidents for.","I pay my taxes, but I've never voted and I never will vote as long as the system works the way it does. Even when Obama was running, I wanted to see a woman run! I'd rather see a woman in the White House as opposed to Obama.","The party lines don't change, that's what makes them a party and you'd be a fool to think that just because there's a black man in there it's not gonna change the real foundation of the system. Especially when you look at his largest contributor to his campaign, AIG, one of the culprits in the economic meltdown itself.","I think there's a lot of the hip-hop crowd behind Barack Obama because he's a black man. Honestly, I'm rooting for Hillary because race is only going to go so far. All the presidents are men at the end of the day.","I do understand that America is a predominantly Christian country. A lot of morals and values are based in Christianity as opposed to Buddhism, which it's not, or Judaism, which it's not, or Islam, which it's definitely not. So I'm not going to lie to myself and just be like, 'Well you know, everybody's equal.' Because we're not.","I just downloaded '1984' for my iPod, but I've read that before. It just hearkens back to the 'romance' of my high-school days. I really liked the space I was in when I was reading it.","For me, I never wore my religion on my sleeve, you know what I'm saying? I never put myself out there as Lupe Fiasco, he's Muslim, he's from Chicago, he likes to ride a skateboard.","Obama came in and gave $700 billion to the bankers off the top as opposed to giving $700 billion to the poor.","I think Romney's talking himself out of the election, to be honest. I was wondering what was gonna happen when the Republican power structure turned the money on, and then they turned on the money and nothing happened.","I have yet to see someone attack Obama over his report card. A lot of people I talk to from both sides of the fence are like, 'Well, what about this economy? What about these incidents?' There are still no answers except time, but time is the answer for everything.","I didn't go out shooting for anybody in particular because I shot for everybody unparticular. I make records for Muslims, Christians, rock 'n roll kids, skateboard kids.","I grew up in the 'hood around prostitutes, drug dealers, killers, and gangbangers, but I also grew up juxtaposed: On the doorknob outside of our apartment, there was blood from some guy who got shot; but inside, there was National Geographic magazines and encyclopedias and a little library bookshelf situation.","We weren't raised Muslim - we were born Muslim. I didn't go to a Muslim school, but it was just the theme song. It was ambient.","This game wears on you. It tears you down. It's perpetual motion for some people who've achieved a level of independence, like Madonna and Jay-Z - they don't need to do music anymore. But there's people who need it. And in that need, that's when it's tough and it tears you to pieces.","I do this for the sake of myself. It's a selfish process. I don't really have any expectations from anyone for your comments or your reviews or your previews.","Some stuff I don't even put out. I'll just be home, happy, creating something for myself, and then ball it up and throw it in the trash. It's less about trying to prove something or get on somebody's list or make a fan happy or make a hater mad or convert a non-believer. That's not the case for me anymore.","You can't control it once you turn it into the label, so there's the expectation that it'll leak a week before the album comes out. That's the world we live in.","Sometimes I wish I never found the Internet. Sometimes I regret getting a laptop and Wi-Fi for logging into the Internet because it is such a distraction. If you have any addictive personality, the Internet will magnify it.","There is no line of demarcation between the amateurs and the pros; everyone is using the same tactics and playing in the same arenas. The only thing that separates them is radio, but the artist doesn't control who goes to radio and who doesn't.","I was literally told for 'The Show Goes On' that I shouldn't rap too deep. I shouldn't be too lyrical. It just needs to be something easy on the eyes. Like a record company telling Picasso that we don't need these abstract interpretations of life, where people have to sit down and look at it and break it down.","I don't have to work on it. I'm naturally a writer. The rapping and writing, they can go hand-in-hand - but rapping is an art that you have to practice and master, so I worked at it for a long time.","The only person who really impressed me with making new music is Cudi. Everyone else seems to be jumping on the same music, the producer-made stuff, but the one person that's made new music to me is Cudi.","With Australian audiences, there's a certain level of education - as far as how much access and exposure they have to music from various genres. So when you do 'Big Day Out' and there are all these different musical acts, you see the same people in your crowd that were there for a completely different artist.","Once you've been on tour six, seven years, you get an idea of what works and what doesn't work universally. There will be some crowds that we just can't play a song, but we've got 90% of a show that we know is going to be a hit with the Lupe Fiasco fan. I think the catering has already been done.","I definitely want to work with Thom Yorke. I want to work with Damien Marley; there's a few international artists I wouldn't mind working with - like Massacre Children would be ill, and I still have an affinity for the U.K. hip hop scene.","With 'Hip-Hop Saved My Life,' I attempted to make 'Kick, Push,' but for rappers. To give a real basic play-by-play of the life of a rapper before he makes it - if he ever makes it, because you can get stuck in that and be trying to make it for the rest of your life."],"Lupe Ontiveros":["I'm proud to represent those hands that labor in this country.","I've given every maid I've portrayed soul and heart.","The deaf community is hungry to see itself in the most positive way.","I long to play a judge. I long to play a lesbian woman. I long to play a councilman, someone with some chutzpah."],"Lupita Nyong'o":["Clay can be dirt in the wrong hands, but clay can be art in the right hands.","I discovered that joy is not the negation of pain, but rather acknowledging the presence of pain and feeling happiness in spite of it.","It's only when you risk failure that you discover things. When you play it safe, you're not expressing the utmost of your human experience.","Slavery is something that is all too often swept under the carpet. The shame doesn't even belong to us, but we still experience it because we're a part of the African race. If it happened to one, it happened to all. We carry that burden.","I give myself homework when I have an audition. I give myself goals, and that's how I check how I'm doing. It can be something simple like 'listen,' or 'find your feet.' And then afterward it's an assessment, so in a way it's not about booking the job or not. It's about what I learned as an actor about that character.","In the madness, you have to find calm.","Personally, I don't ever want to depend on makeup to feel beautiful.","I have a very ostrich mentality. I feel like I have my head in the sand so no one can see me.","My father was a professor of political science and also a young politician fighting for democracy in Kenya, and when things got ugly, he went into political exile in Mexico. Then I moved back to Kenya shortly after I turned one, and I grew up in Kenya.","All throughout filming '12 Years a Slave,' there was a focus like no other. Everyone took ownership of this film and gave their all.","There's always a sense of newness with acting, because every role, you come to every role fresh.","I can speak of actors that I love. I love Cate Blanchett, Viola Davis, her tenacity. I love Charlize Theron. She's so surprising and so exhilarating, the kinds of projects she takes on. Marion Cotillard as well.","I got teased and taunted about my night-shaded skin, and my one prayer to God, the miracle worker, was that I would wake up lighter-skinned. The morning would come, and I would be so excited about seeing my new skin that I would refuse to look down at myself until I was in front of a mirror because I wanted to see my fair face first.","We, as human beings, have the capacity for extreme cruelty.","It's so funny, you go to acting school thinking you're going to learn how to be other people, but really it taught me how to be myself. Because it's in understanding yourself deeply that you can lend yourself to another person's circumstances and another person's experience.","I'm pretty awesome at making salad dressings.","As human beings, what makes us able to empathize with people is a connection that is not necessarily understood mentally.","My father was a professor of political science and also a young politician fighting for democracy in Kenya, and when things got ugly, he went into political exile in Mexico.","I grew up in Nairobi, which is the capital of Kenya, so it's hustle and bustle, and there's always something going on.","I feel privileged that people are looking up to me, and perhaps a dream will be born because of my presence.","I definitely intend to create my own work in the future so that we don't have to keep saying, We don't have work for black women.'","I thrive on structure. I find my freedom in structure.","I was raised in Kenya, and I always wanted to be an actor from when I was really, really little, but the first time I thought it was something that I could make a career of was when I watched 'The Color Purple.' I think I was nine, maybe, and I saw people that looked like me - Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah.","As actors, you become an expert at starting over.","There is something about acting that's mysterious and magical because there is only so much I can do to prepare, and then I have to just let go and breathe and believe that it will come through.","I come from a very close class. I lucked out because drama schools are often very competitive... I have fourteen classmates.","I grew up in the limelight and being the child of someone famous. So my relationship with fame is not bedazzled.","I never understood who all those people are behind the actors! When you see them on the red carpet on TV, you go, 'Why does that person need such a large entourage?' And then you realize that every single person there has a role to play.","My father used to act in high school. He was in a production of 'Othello;' I don't know who he played, but it wasn't Othello. He would talk about it, though, and read Shakespeare to me.","I want to be uncomfortable - acting is uncomfortable.","Growing up, I had really bad skin. I had a skin disorder. Yes, I did. And my mother went to great lengths to try to find something to remedy it. I remember she took a trip to Madagascar and came back with all these alternative, medicinal herbs and stuff. They didn't smell so good, but I think they worked some magic.","My mother talked about the stories I used to spin as a child of three, before I started school. I would tell this story about what school I went to and what uniform I wore and who I talked to at lunchtime and what I ate, and my mother was like, 'This girl does not even go to school.'","I grew up in a world where the majority of people were black, so that wasn't the defining quality of anyone. When you're describing someone, you don't start out with 'he's black, he's white.'","Human beings have an instinct for freedom.","Makeup isn't something I've worn a lot of in my life.","Slavery is something that is all too often swept under the carpet.","I do my best work when I feel conviction to say something through the character I play. Always I want to have integrity and not compromise that.","What's becoming very obvious to me is that fashion is art.","I always envisioned working in film and in theater. Theater and film are not, they're not in any way substitutable. What I love about theater is so different from what I love about film, and I enjoy the craft of both.","Being considered a fashion star is wonderful. It's definitely a bonus thing.","I always love to learn new things. That's the reason I like being an actor.","Ralph Fiennes was a pivotal influence on me. He asked me, 'So what is it you want to do?' I very shyly, timidly admitted that I wanted to be an actor. He sighed, and he said, 'Lupita, only be an actor if you feel there is nothing else in the world you want to do - only do it if you feel you cannot live without acting.'","I loved make-believe. I was the child in the cupboard playing with my Barbies.","I love filmmaking, but I decided to go to drama school because I thought that when I'm 60 and looking back on my life, if acting hadn't been a part of it, I would hate myself.","Home is where my family is.","One of the reasons why I went to the Yale School of Drama is because I felt that I was acting off of instinct, but sometimes that is not reliable. When you're not feeling it, what do you do? So, going to grad school was about getting the tools to just use my instrument to the best of my ability.","I spent some time back in Mexico at 16 because my parents thought it would be prudent for me to learn Spanish, because I held a Mexican passport.","My immediate family was always very supportive. It was my own fear of the rest of the world not accepting me, the rest of our society not accepting my wish to be an actor.","Drama is my sweet spot, but the thing about being an actor is that you want to do a variety of things. I definitely love fantasy and would want to be in a fantasy project.","When I was younger, I was almost too afraid to admit that I wanted to be an actor. I didn't know any successful actors in Kenya, so I felt like I could get away with going to college to study film more easily than I could with saying, 'I want to be an actor.' That's what I did.","The set of '12 Years a Slave' was an extremely joyous one! We all recognized that we were making a powerful, necessary and beautiful film, and we weren't about doing it without that sense of responsibility, and we recognized that we needed each other to tell this story. We also knew we needed to hold each other up as we told the story.","Whoopi Goldberg looked like me, she had hair like mine, she was dark like me. I'd been starved for images of myself. I'd grown up watching a lot of American TV. There was very little Kenyan material, because we had an autocratic ruler who stifled our creative expression.","I have the opportunity to learn about the fashion world, and I appreciate it as an art form... But I never want it to take over my acting.","My conscious life has all been in Kenya, and it's my point of reference. But going back to Mexico was very formative.","I didn't know any successful actors in Kenya, so I felt like I could get away with going to college to study film more easily than I could with saying, 'I want to be an actor.' That's what I did.","I've loved the opportunity to learn about the fashion world and appreciate it as an art form, and I look forward to my continued education, but I never want it to take over my acting.","I am thrilled beyond words that The Academy has recognized my performance in Steve McQueen's '12 Years a Slave,' and I am deeply proud to be in the company of my fellow nominees.","I'm a crybaby.","I thought I was going to school to be other people, but really, what I learned was to be myself - accepting myself, my strengths and weaknesses.","When I was younger, I was almost too afraid to admit that I wanted to be an actor.","I never, in my wildest dreams, could I have thought that the first role I get out of school would lead to an Oscar nomination.","It's great to have something to dress up for. You know, I spent three years in slacks at drama school, so now I like putting a dress on.","I was born in Mexico because my father was teaching at a school in Mexico City. I was born during the third year he was there. And when I was 16, I returned to Mexico to learn Spanish.","To this day, I love eating steak tacos before going to the red carpets.","I would love to have a career that's governed by the material; I always want to be part of stories that I feel are worthwhile.","My parents gave me a Mexican name. In our culture, we are named after the events of the day.","I grew up watching foreign programs - American, English, Mexican, and very little Kenyan. 'The Color Purple' was the first time I saw people who looked like me.","I haven't always been gluten-free.","Every single laundromat, grocery store, everything is called 'Lupita' in Mexico.","The muscles you flex in theater are muscles that you really need. I must always find a way to get back there. It's irreplaceable.","I'm still trying to get over the fact that my name is being mentioned with people like Brad Pitt.","I'm interested in generating work for myself. I have trouble with this waiting-for-the-phone-to-ring lifestyle, especially after drama school, which was so creatively fulfilling.","The Hollywood Film Awards were really stressful. It was the biggest press line I'd ever seen.","Being a part of '12 Years a Slave' has been one of the most profound experiences of my life.","Part of being an artist is that you are always concerned you don't have what it takes. It... keeps us honest.","As human beings, we aren't as individual as we'd like to believe we are. And I think that's what makes acting possible. Despite the fact that I have not experienced something, I have it in my human capacity to imagine it and to put myself in someone else's shoes, and to take someone else's circumstances personally.","I had moved back to Kenya after undergrad, and I went through this crisis of, 'What is my life going to be about?'","Steve McQueen is a genius. And I think that word is overused, but I think with Steve it's rightly used. He's a genius."],"Lurlene McDaniel":["Old characters never die, but I do need to take a break from them in order to create new ones.","On TV, stories and events are finalized in 30 or 60 minutes, or neatly tied up after a season or two. The best stories are the ones that force us to come to our own conclusions and to explain why we believe in our conclusions.","By using novels, I show ordinary kids confronting and overcoming great odds."],"Lusia Strus":["I actually would love to live in New York. But I need land; I need space. I'd love to move to a place where I could have a lot of land and a goat.","I've always had this deep and chronic sense of dissatisfaction.","College was a great time. I partied there, but I also learned how to act.","Acting is very much like a child making believe. I'm not one to become a character, but I fall in love with the character. It's like having faith; you're going to be that person for a while.","I don't call myself an artist. I act. That's what I do.","I get bored at the theatre a lot because I notice that there's not always a connection between the actors. They may be technically proficient, but they're not surprising each other. I'm thrilled by actors who make choices that are surprising.","I personally take cues directly from the script, then I like to surprise the other actors. But you must maintain control on a level and see how far you can go up, down or out emotionally. You have to balance the craft with spontaneity.","I pray to be of service to the playwright, the audience, the other actors and my character.","I realized that I wanted to play characters and do traditional theatre. I wanted to make believe again. I like putting on a costume and pretending to be someone else for a few hours, and I have a great respect for playwrights.","I think my face and voice suit me better as I get older.","There's a part of me that wants to be known and make a comfortable living but still be able to go grocery shopping. My overall idea of success is having people I want to work with want to work with me.","What draws me to the theatre, and what appealed to me about Too Much Light, is that you have no idea what's going to happen. That's the most exciting part of theatre, it's never the same. If it were, it would be like watching a movie.","What I love about theatre is that it disappears as it happens.","I always wanted attention, and I realized I could make people laugh."],"Luther Allison":["I've been waiting for that bright sunshine to show up and shine in my back door someday.","I don't want to be in some big beautiful place that nobody want me, because I play the blues.","But let's face it, I still have to look at my self and look at the things I've done down the stretch.","I mean, look how many musicians have come through and played beside me, and I'm workin' and they're not.","But you know, I still had a dream of being able to go back home and tour.","And I can do the rock clubs if I have to.","Well, I first started going to Europe in the late '70s.","But my big thing was always the blues.","So I cut out all the drinkin' and hangin' out and stuff like that early on.","I focused on how these people became how they were.","I want people to recognize Luther Allison when I play.","Buddy Guy finally got a break and made it. And Buddy Guy deserves it.","I look in music magazines now and see things on Luther Allison, and my name's getting out there more, thanks to all the good people at Alligator Records and at my management company.","Well, I've had to deal with everything in my life... leavin' the family, learnin' what not and what to do.","We played the same thing in Europe we played in the States.","But there was not a job that could say that Luther Allison didn't do his job.","In the blues, it just takes so long for us to get recognized.","What I want to do, is play music for somebody who believe in me.","I want to play in a place people want to hear me.","Me being a skinny guy, I could crawl into the steel pit.","But I did that, and I created another blues scene, another something I can sing about.","I have as much input to the blues; I just never got the chance, the opportunity or maybe the respect.","I think I'm the most positive guy still going in my generation, and I'm out there to prove that.","In the States, it takes you a lifetime just to get from Chicago's South Side to the West Side.","When I got to Chicago I had to find my way.","The blues is the foundation, and it's got to carry the top. The other part of the scene, the rock 'n' roll and the jazz, are the walls of the blues.","Before I left, I opened a lot of doors for a lot of people to play the blues.","But I never had that commercial opportunity to be played on the radio, so how could I be popular?","I had the qualifications, but I was not chosen."],"Luther Burbank":["Flowers always make people better, happier, and more helpful; they are sunshine, food and medicine for the soul.","The secret of improved plant breeding, apart from scientific knowledge, is love.","We must return to nature and nature's god.","If we had paid no more attention to our plants than we have to our children, we would now be living in a jungle of weed.","I see humanity now as one vast plant, needing for its highest fulfillment only love, the natural blessings of the great outdoors, and intelligent crossing and selection.","Science is knowledge arranged and classified according to truth, facts, and the general laws of nature.","It is well for people who think to change their minds occasionally in order to keep them clean. For those who do not think, it is best at least to rearrange their prejudices once in a while.","Less than fifteen per cent of the people do any original thinking on any subject. The greatest torture in the world for most people is to think.","For those who do not think, it is best at least to rearrange their prejudices once in a while.","If you violate Nature's laws you are your own prosecuting attorney, judge, jury, and hangman.","In the span of my own lifetime I observed such wondrous progress in plant evolution that I look forward optimistically to a healthy, happy world as soon as its children are taught the principles of simple and rational living.","Heredity is nothing but stored environment.","The scientist is a lover of truth for the very love of truth itself, wherever it may lead."],"Luther Campbell":["Words are just words.","Tampa's crazy... The ladies in Tampa come in all flavors. I felt like I was at Dairy Queen.","People expect me to be with some stripper... That's just the kind of woman I work with.","If it wasn't for 2 Live Crew videos wouldn't look like they do and rappers wouldn't sound like they do.","I'm gonna perform on one of the nights. Good clean fun; we're not going to jail. For the record.","I want to do a record with Monica Lewinsky.","I have done so much for hip-hop and 'til this day, I haven't received any awards or any recognition for it.","I am tired of being in an industry that doesn't appreciate me.","I am going into the adult market because they don't care what label you are signed to or who you know.","I also want to announce that I'm changing my name. I haven't told anyone. You get the scoop.","Goodness and hard work are rewarded with respect."],"Luther Strange":["Under President Obama, we saw an unwarranted extension of amnesty programs which neglected the root of the illegal immigration crisis. We saw a troubling lack of urgency in addressing the sanctuary cities which subvert the rule of law.","Our farmers feed the world. They are up before dawn and work till well after sunset. They face any number of challenges they can't control, from too much rain to not enough, from disease to insect infestations.","A job is the best cure for poverty, and that's why economic development and job creation has been my principle focus.","When President Trump and I arrived in Washington, there was a new sense that the crisis of illegal immigration would now be taken seriously.","We have a fabulous civil rights history here in Birmingham.","Stewardship of our air and water is a responsibility that should be free of the bias of politics. What's more, environmental regulators should abide by the law.","I stand with President Trump in the fight to make sanctuary cities pay for the border wall.","The federal, state, and local governments are involved in virtually every aspect of business.","Short of the passage of a Constitutional Amendment protecting marriage as between one man and one woman, the U.S. Supreme Court has the final say.","We want to make sure that we take care of people that most need healthcare, make sure they actually get healthcare instead of just an insurance policy that means they can't access the doctor they want.","Science has advanced a long way in the 44 years since Roe v. Wade, and it is time that our laws reflect the undeniable truth that life begins at fertilization and that unborn citizens are entitled to the same protections as every American.","I think more and more business leaders are becoming aware of the impact of the government in their success.","I have no doubt that Russia tried to meddle in our election. They're going to continue trying to - just like they have my entire lifetime.","We have neglected our aerospace program, and I am detecting a lot of bipartisan support to continue that mission.","We have a failing Medicaid system, and you know who that's going to hurt in the end are the most vulnerable in people in our society.","I'm running because I think I'm the best candidate to take Jeff Sessions' place.","Tom McMillen was a three-term congressman from Maryland. He is the tallest member of Congress. Period. He's 6'11''.","I think the thing that's impressed me the most has been the fantastic professionalism of the officials in the Senate.","It's really important if you're in politics to have a loyal friend.","I was recruited at Alabama and at Auburn to play basketball.","It just worries me that if we start trying to erase history that we can learn from, where does that end? Do you start taking away books people find offensive? It's just a path that seems very dangerous to me in this country.","You can't erase history.","We learn from history. That's what it's all about.","To suggest the President of the United States and the head of the free world - the man who is changing the world - is being manipulated by Mitch McConnell is insulting to the president; it's absolutely insulting.","I have been fighting - and winning - against Obama-era experiments with illegal amnesty.","I am confident that President Trump's administration is capable of making the Pentagon run at maximum efficiency and enacting procurement reforms that will get weapons and assets to our warfighters more quickly and efficiently.","I agree with President Trump that our trade deals need to be renegotiated so they are more fair to American workers.","I'm not backing down on immigration. I'm not backing down on the wall.","President Trump is the greatest thing that's happened to this country. I consider it a biblical miracle that he's there.","If I have to filibuster on the Senate floor, I'll even read the King James Bible until the wall is funded.","Daily fantasy sports operators claim that they operate legally under Alabama law. However, paid daily fantasy sports contests are, in fact, illegal gambling under Alabama law.","I have the best job in politics in Alabama. As the attorney general, I just go to work every day and think of a way to sue the Obama Administration. If you don't think that is fun, that is a full-time job.","Almost every day, you see an article in the papers about someone violating a campaign finance law.","A corporation cannot make a campaign contribution to a candidate for federal office.","Sen. Sessions' commitment to public service is nearly unparalleled in Alabama history, and his departure from the Senate leaves tremendous shoes to fill.","I pledge to the people of Alabama to continue the same level of leadership as Jeff Sessions in consistently fighting to protect and advance the conservative values we all care about.","Based on my experience and record, I'm the best person to take Jeff Sessions' place.","I've had the honor and privilege of knowing Jeff for over 25 years. He's been a dear friend and a mentor, and there is no finer person in public service than Jeff Sessions. He's conducted himself with the greatest integrity of any public official I've ever met.","America is very fortunate to have Jeff Sessions as Attorney General.","There's a learning curve to understanding how the Senate operates.","I've got that hands-on experience with federal judges and how important it is to have judges like Neil Gorsuch, who will take a rule-of-law approach to the decision-making process. I think he's eminently qualified.","We need to work as hard as President Trump is working.","Alabama has a history of safeguarding our freedom of religion.","If the federal government believes free contraception is vital, then surely it can find another way to implement it than by forcing family businesses and religious broadcasters and others to violate their religious beliefs.","The U.S. Military is no place for social experiments.","As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, my first priority is to ensure the readiness of our military.","I've always been supportive of President Trump and his agenda, and that's what people in the state that I talk to care about.","I feel very comfortable being compared to Sen. Sessions.","I have the utmost confidence in Sen. Sessions, now General Sessions.","It's frustrating when people question your integrity.","Exxon fought claims resulting from the Exxon Valdez spill in court for 20 years. Alabama could have suffered the same fate. What would be the benefit to the state or its coastal counties in delaying indefinitely the receipt of monies that we need sooner rather than later?","The BP settlement is a victory for Alabama: not only for the amount of compensation we were able to secure, but also for avoiding many more years of litigation.","The BP settlement is good for Alabama, particularly Alabama's coastal region.","It is hard to imagine any single special interest trying to buy an office without a motive.","I simply apply the law fairly and equally to all our citizens.","BP cannot undo a settlement it negotiated and signed just to avoid its consequences.","Alabama has made great progress in proving that BP, Halliburton, and Transocean are liable for the devastating effects of the oil spill.","Unfortunately, the Obama administration is more interested in furthering its political agenda than in following the law.","As Attorney General of Alabama, I have never hesitated to stand up to the EPA before when it was wrong.","Every day, the hard-working men and women of Alabama's Department of Environmental Management are on the ground, protecting Alabama's rivers and lakes in a way that is beneficial to all. EPA should support them in that work, not make it more difficult.","No one is arguing that the entire Voting Rights Act is unconstitutional. Section 2 is the most important part of the act. It gives people the right to challenge discriminatory laws in court. It applies to the entire nation. It is constitutional, and it will continue to protect all Americans.","The people of Alabama are fed up. They are tired of politicians who lie to them, and they are sick of elected officials who've been in Washington so long they've forgotten why they ran in the first place.","What I see in Washington reminds me of what I saw in Montgomery when I was first elected Alabama's Attorney General. In Montgomery, corruption was the problem, so I assembled the finest public corruption prosecution team in the country. Their work wasn't always popular with the mainstream media or the local politicians. We didn't let that stop us.","I promised to carry on Jeff Session's legacy of fighting for the conservative values we believe in. I promised to help pass the Trump agenda and serve the people's interest, not the special interests. And I promised to help Donald Trump drain the swamp in Washington.","I drafted and proposed a law to secure our borders and build the border wall - and make the sanctuary cities pay for it.","If the federal government can mandate what we have to spend our own money on, then the federal government can make us buy something even if we are morally opposed to paying for it.","Governing through federal ultimatum grates against our history, traditions, and, most importantly, our Constitution.","Climate change is not an excuse to give the federal government ever more power over private property and state resources.","Debate about the causes and consequences of climate change and the policy positions taken in response to it should be encouraged, not silenced.","Climate change is not an excuse to silence political speech.","Climate change is not an excuse for the EPA to ignore the bounds of law and issue illegal regulations that will cost jobs, shutter industries, and have little to no positive impact on the environment.","The Obama administration demonstrated time and again a disturbing willingness to bypass the separation of powers and disregard Congress as a Constitutional watchdog.","George Wallace is gone; Bull Connor is dead. He's not coming back.","Alabama and other states had a terrible record in terms of depriving people of their right to vote, making it difficult for them to vote, discriminating against people.","When my good friend Jeff Sessions endorsed Donald Trump, that was good enough for me.","When I was attorney general, we had the strongest public integrity unit in the country.","Shame on Congressman Brooks for his lack of faith in President Trump's and Attorney General Sessions' commitment to work together to make America great again.","As attorney general, I don't get to pick and choose the laws I like and don't like.","We rely on the rule of law. I think we've lost touch with that concept in Washington.","The Obama administration's EPA ruling to cut carbon emissions at power plants is a direct affront to workers in states like Alabama, which not only rely upon coal-fired plants to generate most of their electricity but are also home to thousands of coal industry jobs.","The extremist agenda of the Obama administration is forcing unwarranted higher energy costs upon Americans and further threatening an already sluggish economic recovery.","As a gun owner and sportsman, I am proud to join NRA members from across the country to make the voice of liberty heard.","The Second Amendment reflects the brilliance of our founders, who knew that no right is guaranteed unless we are willing to fight for it, and I remain committed to fighting for the rights of lawful gun owners as the senator for Alabama.","I am very pleased with President Trump's selection of Judge Neil Gorsuch as his first appointee to the U.S. Supreme Court.","I am confident that Jeff Sessions will do his part to restore the delicate balance between the states and the federal government that the Founders envisioned.","I was proud to cast my vote for President Trump.","As I have said before, our society cannot be truly prosperous until it respects the rights of the most vulnerable among us.","The Obamacare law has failed.","The fault always lies in the candidate or the head coach or the guy holding the ball.","To suggest that the President of the United States - the head of the free world, a man who is changing the world - is being manipulated by Mitch McConnell is insulting to the president.","Our religious liberty was threatened by the Obama administration as part of the Obamacare law. I was in the courtroom when that law was, I think unjustly, held constitutional."],"Luther Vandross":["The best part is still ahead of me - I haven't experienced my 'good old days' yet.","I'd like to be remembered as a premier singer of songs, not just a popular act of a given period.","All through school, I was losing hundreds of pounds in school, so that's a journey - that's an old journey. I'm tired of that. I know that road.","I feel a sense of sadness and joy. Mostly sadness though about what I've experienced and sadness about what others have experienced in reference to the stroke.","When I was larger, people said I was fat. Now that I've lost weight, they say I died."],"Luvvie Ajayi":["I feel like my career is to speak truth to power, and a lot of times, that sounds like troublemaking. If speaking truth is troublemaking, then yes, I will consider myself a professional at that.","People think you can find a mentor by walking up to somebody and saying, 'Hey, be my mentor,' or by sending an e-mail to someone you've never e-mailed before and saying, 'Hey, I want you to mentor me.' But, mentorship really happens in rooms that you're actually in.","I want to create a TV show that people will watch and say, 'Hey, I have a favorite character,' or 'Hey, that person reminds me of myself,' or 'Hey, I've made some of those same mistakes, or those are some of the things I've dealt with.'","It took me a while to affirm the fact that I'm actually a really good writer. I couldn't even call myself a writer with a straight face because I didn't take my gift seriously.","I think that if everybody committed themselves to making a better world than how we found it, things would be much better than what they are.","The cool thing about the Internet now is it's democratized platforms. Like, anybody can create a blog. Anybody can give themselves some type of place where their work is visible.","A book is not a short-term project. It's essentially your baby, so it takes a lot of work.","Putting out a book is absolutely a lesson in vulnerability because it doesn't matter how much of an audience you have. Some people who have giant audiences can't sell books because those audiences don't feel like they need to give them their money.","People love my voice because they say I say what they were thinking but dare not to say because they had a filter or a job.","Who needs soap operas now when we have social media timelines? Now you can get a similar drama fix by just paying attention to your friends and family members' Facebook pages.","I knew exactly what I wanted to be when I grew up. I was like, 'I'm going to be a doctor!' Doctor Luvvie was the dream. I was Doc McStuffins before it was a thing.","My integrity is something I hold dear.","Telling the truth - telling thoughtful truths - should not be a revolutionary act. Speaking truths to power should not be sacrificial, but they are.","Avoidance has never been a great tactic in solving any problem. For most situations in life, not addressing what's going on only makes matters worse.","Being able to live without having to be defined by your skin color is the hallmark of privilege.","The most glaring aspect of white privilege is that when someone is described neutrally - without indicating color or ethnicity - more often than not, people will assume that the person is white. That assumption indicates an uncomfortable truth: in our society, whiteness determines humanity.","I want people to see my color and my culture written all over me, because I am proud of the skin I'm in. It is an important part of my identity. What I don't want them to do is mistreat me because of it.","Chicago's one of the most segregated cities in America. Everybody lives in their own silos and vacuums.","People need to seek out some diversity in their life. One of my friends is a pig farmer in Michigan, and even she has black friends. She's in the middle of nowhere - the closest airport is, like, three hours away - and she manages to connect with black people.","I could write a whole other book called 'I'm Judging You, America!' I still might.","In a world that wants women to whisper, I choose to yell.","People use the guise of art, and artistic expression, to do all kinds of hateful things. It's like Trump and everybody else using the guise of humor to say hateful things, the excuse being, 'I was just being funny.'","I knew I was Yoruba and Nigerian for the first 9 years of my life. I did not become conscious of my color and all that came with it until I moved to the United States with my family.","Being conscious of Global Blackness is knowing that we are not an island of our struggle but a nation of our triumphs. That's blackness to me.","Through my school years, I learned more about slavery, anti-black racism, and oppression in the U.S., and my blackness could no longer be an afterthought. I started wearing it proudly, and as my consciousness deepened, so did my love for black folks.","I am of the bridge generation that remembers life before social media permeated everything but cannot imagine life without it now.","In my workshops for young adults, the most important thing I emphasize is that anything posted online, no matter how private they think it is, is permanent.","People are prospering from being unapologetically offensive, trite, and stupid. And we are tweeting ourselves into high blood pressure and ulcers trying to tell them to do better... Being a pompous nut biscuit is now a publicity strategy, and I don't know what we can do to end the madness.","Humor is this great equalizer. It gets people's defenses down, and once they're down, you can discuss some really difficult topics.","Shoes are my love language, and women love shoes.","You can be tweeting strangers and saying, 'Don't say that,' but are you saying that to your friends? How about your mom? Your boyfriend at the dinner table who says something homophobic? If you're not saying the same things in person that you're saying online, then what are your tweets doing?","When I set out to write 'I'm Judging You,' I wanted to create something that was both timely and timeless. But I didn't know how timely this book would be until we, the people of the United States, elected a walking Cheeto to the highest office in the land on November 8, 2016.","I have no love for those who consider themselves 'good people' but stand idly by as the world crumbles around them. It's not enough to personally not do damage. If you're present as someone else destroys what's around you and you do nothing, you helped them.","Fear has a very concrete power of keeping us from doing and saying the things that are our purpose.","Being quiet is comfortable. Keeping things the way they've been is comfortable. And all comfort has done is maintain the status quo.","I wasn't the only person out there writing about pop culture and race, but I stayed true to my voice, and people felt attracted to that. They said it felt like they were having brunch with their best friend.","Under promise and over deliver. People will be pleasantly surprised that you gave more than they expected. And remember that there is always room for us to be better and do better. That's what I am calling for. Not just everybody else - myself, too.","Do one thing today that scares you - and you already know what that is! - and go do it. Even if you just make one step toward it, it will help you look at the world differently.","That's one thing brands are understanding is, I'm the blogger who's not writing about fashion. I'm not writing about beauty. I'm not writing about gossip. I'm not writing about politics. I'm writing about all of that. I'm the person they can come to if they just want to reach people who care and have their fingers on pop culture.","If we don't challenge each other to use our platforms for better than our niches or what our quote-unquote brand is, what are we doing as influencers? If we can't activate our audiences at the times it's important or needed, then what do we have these platforms for?","If a brand will shy away from you because you dare to say that black lives matter, that's probably not a brand you want to work with anyway.","I think it's important for service to be a part of your life instead of an option. It's awesome to make it a point to do something that's gonna make the world slightly better than you left it.","I've reached the point where people text me randomly for favors, like, 'Hey can I pick your brain?' People I haven't talked to in years are asking for favors. It's like, 'Wow people really got some nerve.'","When people say things like, 'Oh, I can't find black or brown whatever position it is,' I wanted to be clear that we exist in droves. When I tell people, 'Hey, share your work, share your LinkedIn,' it's with the ultimate goal that somebody on that thread gets hired, or something positive happens.","As a freelancer, as a writer, and running my company, people have always tried to negotiate me down. Some might think that I might accept their offers because they think I don't have many options. The truth is, I always have options available to me.","You can't just set the vision, take a nap, and not keep working on making your vision happen. Your intention has to be backed by work.","Sticking with your craft goes a long way in ensuring that you'll be successful.","I need to sleep more. The 'sleep when I die' mantra is not cute.","Fire Yourself. Outsource some of your life. Because you know what won't be cute on a tombstone? 'Her grind was impeccable, and she did it all by herself.'","Working 16-hour days to ensure that I can pay my bills has been a bulk of my entrepreneurship life. And on days when I don't, odds are I'm running to the airport.","'Imposter Syndrome' is the feeling of wearing a mask and playing a role that one does not feel at home in. It is when you feel like you or your work is a fluke and that you're a dwarf amongst giants. Many of us have this, especially when we're in some sort of creative industry.","I am not the best. I don't have to be. I am enough.","Never underestimate the power of confidence. If you believe you're the dopest thing walking, you might convince people of the same just because you're so headstrong about it as a fact.","Doubt has purpose sometimes. If we don't think our work is good enough, we strive to do better and be better. Which then makes us better because practice does just that.","I wish people were realer in talking about how leaps of faith don't have to be taken without at least looking down first.","I am a firm believe in the power of dreams, because the world is basically one giant realization of people's collective dreams come true. We need to dream to aspire to do something that keeps us striving. But those dreams and ideas and wants mean nothing without execution, which doesn't usually happen without a plan.","Unless life is one giant rap battle, you don't need to freestyle your way to success.","What I sacrificed as I pursued my dreams was my comfort, not the lives of other people who looked to me to stay afloat. That alone freed me to take more risks, which did pay off in dividends. Having a safety net is an asset that most people do not have.","There are two types of people in this world: people who can be on time and Nigerians. I am in the latter group, and I confess to my inability to arrive anywhere punctually.","Find me someone who is Nigerian who is always on time for things that aren't work-related, and I will find you a Tyrese quote that makes perfect sense. They might exist, but they sure are rare.","Toddlers are couthless. Lord. They are so couth-deficient. They'll tell you, 'Those shoes look like my nightmares' without a second thought because your feelings don't matter to them.","Good friends are often our lifelines. Mine have seen me through heartbreak, through the deaths of loved ones, and through that phase in college when I was obsessed with denim jumpsuits and matching fingerless gloves.","Being a 'good man' is something you do, not something you are."],"Lyall Watson":["Smell is a long-distance sense, a way of stretching time and finding out in advance what lies ahead.","If elephants didn't exist, you couldn't invent one. They belong to a small group of living things so unlikely they challenge credulity and common sense.","If the brain were so simple we could understand it, we would be so simple we couldn't.","Even in the lives of fishes, sensation is seldom a matter of one thing or another. Senses overlap. The lines between them often tend to be blurred, and the best that we can manage, by way of description from the outside, is to say that the senses of fishes appear to dominate one at a time.","All I do is look, listen and try to make sense of what I find, in biological terms.","I live and work alone and travel light, relying largely on my memory and making a point of letting intuition guide my way.","Smell was our first sense. It is even possible that being able to smell was the stimulus that took a primitive fish and turned a small lump of olfactory tissue on its nerve cord into a brain. We think because we smelled.","Before sight and sound hijacked our attention, we shared with all life a sort of common sense, a chemical sense that depended on direct contact with matter in the water or the air.","Smell is stimulating. It stirs things up and makes us nostalgic - a wonderful word which literally means 'ache for home' - which serves to inspire new circuits in the brain.","The limits of sensory evolution in fish are defined very largely by their habitat. Water is physically supportive, carries some kinds of odour well, and is kind to sound - letting it travel several times faster than air will allow, but it inhibits other more personal kinds of communication.","Breathing air is a liberating experience. It freed our ancestors from the constraints of staying wet or having to remain within easy reach of water for refuge, respiration or reproduction. But the biggest change it made in our lives was to expose us to a whole new range of sensory experience.","Air is traditionally 'thin,' but the more we learn about our atmosphere, the more substantial it becomes. In some places it is so filled with inorganic flotsam that it is almost thick enough to plough; in others, it has become so primed with the by-products of life that it comes close to being a living tissue in its own right.","Even the cleanest air, at the centre of the South Pacific or somewhere over Antarctica, has two hundred thousand assorted bits and pieces in every lungful. And this count rises to two million or more in the thick of the Serengeti migration, or over a six-lane highway during rush hour in downtown Los Angeles.","We share our planet quite naturally with a permanent aeroplankton; a buoyant ecology too soft to hear, too small to see, but heavy with mood and meaning. Imagine being aware of all these airy inclusions - and you can begin to understand how it might feel to be able to smell really well.","I have had close relationships with three species of wild pigs, each a chance encounter on a different continent, and all continue to enrich my life in surprising ways.","Seriously, a smaller, leaner, cleaner, tuskless and more secretive elephant is exactly what is needed. It definitely would live longer."],"Lydia Davis":["If a translation doesn't have obvious writing problems, it may seem quite all right at first glance. We readers, after all, quickly adapt to the style of a translator, stop noticing it, and get caught up in the story.","Often, the idea that there can be a wide range of translations of one text doesn't occur to people - or that a translation could be bad, very bad, and unfaithful to the original.","My stories are sometimes closer to poems or meditations, but often there is at least a little narrative in them.","I do see an interest in writing for Twitter. While publishers still do love the novel and people do still like to sink into one, the very quick form is appealing because of the pace of life.","I would recommend, definitely, developing a 'day job' that you like - don't expect to make money writing!","I think the close work I do as a translator pays off in my writing - I'm always searching for multiple ways to say things.","I never dream in French, but certain French words seem better or more fun than English words - like 'pois chiches' for chick peas!","I don't pare down much. I write the beginning of a story in a notebook and it comes out very close to what it will be in the end. There is not much deliberateness about it.","I am basically the sort of person who has stage-fright teaching. I kind of creep into a classroom. I'm not an anecdote-teller, either, although I often wish I were.","I started writing the one-sentence stories when I was translating 'Swann's Way.' There were two reasons. I had almost no time to do my own writing, but didn't want to stop. And it was a reaction to Proust's very long sentences.","I don't like to hurt people's feelings, and I don't like to knock other writers as a matter of principle.","I've gotten very alert not just to mixed metaphor but to any writing mistake.","I see people sometimes who remind me of my narrators.","I follow my interests pretty - I don't like the word 'intuitively.' I follow them in a kind of natural way, without questioning them too much.","I think I have a sense right in the beginning of how big an idea it is and how much room it needs, and, almost more importantly, how long it would sustain anybody's interest.","I find teaching - I like it, but I find just walking into the classroom and facing the students very difficult.","I always interrupt work with other work, either in a small way or big way, so that's normal.","All of the little entries in 'The Cows' were written in an irregular way. There might be one or two done one day, and then two weeks might go by or four weeks, and then they were put in an order or sequence.","Ordering is difficult. It's like arranging pieces of music in a concert: What do you put first? What do you put after the intermission? I want the reader to be sort of surprised, to come to each story freshly.","Collections aren't really planned. I just keep writing short pieces until I have enough for a collection.","I wrote the first draft of 'Madame Bovary' without studying the previous translations, although I gathered them and took the occasional peek.","I first read 'Madame Bovary' in my teens or early twenties.","The existence of another, competing translation is a good thing, in general, and only immediately discouraging to one person - the translator who, after one, two, or three years of more or less careful work, sees another, and perhaps superior, version appear as if overnight.","Of course we may have any number of translations of a given text - the more the better, really.","Even though I believe a superlative translation can achieve timelessness, that doesn't mean I think other translators shouldn't attempt other versions. The more the better, in the end.","I do see an interest in writing for Twitter.","If I was writing about an academic or a more difficult person, I would use the Latinate vocabulary more, but I do think Anglo-saxon is the language of emotion.","I do think novels are overlooked. I did write one some years ago that I think is quite good, called 'The End of the Story,' not to blow my own horn."],"Lydia Ko":["It's important for me to understand more about my swing and my game, no matter who I end up working with.","Um, yeah 15-year-olds don't lead at an LPGA event all the time. But like I said, I'm very surprised. I've been playing really good golf and I'm confident with my game.","I feel like there are a lot of positives in my swing. I'm really going to work around the rhythm of my swing, being able to keep my rhythm and being more consistent. Consistency is what I'm looking for, performance-wise.","I'd love to go out on a Saturday night with my friends and watch a movie, but that happens really like once a year or a couple of times.","A 3-foot putt can be more nerve-racking than a 9-foot putt because a 3-foot putt you should be getting in. A 9-footer, there's a chance it won't go in.","I've played such good golf, and it was hard coming up and it wasn't easy in any matches or any shots. It means a lot. I think hopefully it will mean a lot to New Zealand because I'm the next winner of the U.S. Amateur after Danny Lee.","I've got a golf scholarship for school, so they understand if I'm away. A couple of years ago they called to see why I wasn't at school, and now they're like, 'oh, she's at golf.' Sometimes I'm in class and sometimes the teachers don't realize I'm there. She goes, 'oh, Lydia's absent.' And I'm like 'no, actually, I'm here.'","Everyone gets surprised because neither one of my parents play golf. Like I said in my speech, my aunt and uncle really love golf, and we visited them, and she gave me two clubs. Like people think when they don't know who my dad is, they think he's my coach.","If I make a bogey or three putt I'm on fire inside. But it's not like you're going to play any better slamming your club or getting angry. So you might as well just keep it in. People say I'm pretty calm, but I do make mistakes and I do get angry, but I try and not show it.","Before, I was like 'Oh my God, I have to do this media, this media and this media,' but now I've learned these are stages you need to go through. If you play really good golf, you're going to get more media attention and more interest in you, and you'll get more confident handling it.","I can't say I'm not nervous at all with media and doing speeches, but I'm getting used to it and better at it, hopefully.","Golf is like 99.9 percent of my life, and then there's school. I don't get much time to go out with my friends.","One of my goals is to play the Olympics in 2016. If you're able to represent your country in the Olympics everyone will understand you as a player and not many people do get to go to the Olympics.","I have always wanted a dog, but we don't have anyone to care for it.","Two weeks ago at the U.S. Amateur, my mom caddied, and that is kind of a different feeling, because she's your mom and you have to listen to her. It was really comfortable having my mom there, but it's also really relieving and comfortable to have someone that knows the course off their hat, really.","It's never easy playing 36 holes when you are concentrating so much for all the shots.","Ever since they announced that golf would be returning to the Olympics, I thought, 'Hey, I wanna get myself on the team.' It has always been my dream.","When I was getting overly 'droppy,' that's when I was hitting shots left and right. That's what we were doing, so maybe if my swing was a touch flatter, I wouldn't drop the club as much.","The best cure for a double-bogey is a toffee, or sugar - any type of sugar; I love my chocolate."],"Lydia Leonard":["When I was a child, I wanted to be a jockey. I love horses, but it's not practical to have one in London. I also wanted to be an accountant, which isn't glamorous at all, but my dad was one, and I quite liked maths.","Anne Boleyn was a warrior forced to use the only tools available to a woman in her position at that time. She was bold and ambitious, and had she had a son, history would have been very different.","There's a certain amount of pressure that comes from playing real people. It's a pressure to deliver something fair and right to the real person and any living relatives. But generally, it's a joy, as you get to target your interest on a particular era.","People ask me if I think Anne Boleyn was a feminist... but she wasn't striking out on behalf of women, and she wasn't particularly keen on them.","You have to accept that when you don't get the part, it's to do with all sorts of reasons completely beyond your control, unless you know it's because you weren't prepared.","As actors, you always have that moment thinking you've been absolutely terrible or a fraud.","Anne Boleyn is certainly the most exciting character I have played on stage.","I was born in Paris, and my mother was a French teacher, but then I rebelled against my upbringing and studied Spanish in school. So now I just speak bad French and bad Spanish.","I've never done a musical, and I don't think I could do one, but I would love to play Sally Bowles in 'Cabaret.'","Anne Boleyn isn't a sympathetic character, but I like that she isn't a people pleaser. She's ambitious and manipulative, but she's honest. I'm biased, but I don't think a woman who has said 'no' to the King of England for six years would jump into bed with four of his best friends. She was a slick political mind.","Greek tragedy was pre-Freudian, so every emotion has to be so raw; there are no psychological undertones.","I used to love 'Jeeves And Wooster.' That theme tune was great. I remember writing to them when I was little to get the music so I could learn it on the piano, and they sent me the sheet music.","I'd always wanted to be an actor, ever since I was very little. I don't know why.","Professionally, I was at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School and did lots of things there, and then I won the BBC Carlton Hobbs Award, so I did some BBC Radio drama work, which is a lovely way to start out because you work with lots of great people, and you're working all the time, so you're learning rather than sitting around and waitressing.","I knew who Jackie Kennedy was in terms of being the wife of JFK and being a clothes horse, and I knew that she later married Onassis, but I had a very, very vague idea of who he was.","Television's so quick, and there's so many other fun elements to it, but you don't get such good scripts and the time to really make much more three dimensional characters.","I've met more than one person in their early 20s who has never heard of Jackie Onassis, though most girls have because she exists as a fashion icon.","What you think is going to be a big break or opportunity can sometimes turn into the opposite, and vice versa.","Broadway is the actor's Mt. Everest - but with more flattering frocks.","'Broadway' is one of the big American words. It's exciting to be given the chance to rattle around in one of the big words.","I don't think I'm intense."],"Lydia Lunch":["If what I write is literature, I guess you'd better emphasize the 'litter.'","If someone says 'grunge' or 'punk,' you know what the sound is, but if you say 'No Wave,' it's kind of mysterious. That was the most interesting part and should have been the most inspirational thing about it... here's this collective sonic insanity, and none of it sounds anything alike.","I have to laugh because despite the destruction, we cannot let 'them' steal our pleasure. That is always the theme of my performances: I'm here to thrive, not just to survive.","If people could understand how much pleasure they could have by themselves, I think everyone would be a lot saner. I think that people really need a dose of quality time with one's self.","I believe happiness is a chemical imbalance - it's a silly thing to strife for. But satisfaction - if you seek satisfaction, you can succeed. Satisfaction is knowing that you're doing the best that you can do; you're living your life to the fullest.","I'm completely optimistic - I know the end is coming!","I'm nihilistic, antagonistic, violent, horrible - but not obliterated, yet. I just refuse to be beaten down. I think it's stubborness that keeps me going.","The biggest insult is that I've been called an exaggerator... I tell the truth as I know it. I don't glamorize the nightmare and horror that I witness; I just digest it and spew it back, with venom.","I used to think feminism was a liberating force - now I see many of those people are just censors under a different name.","I am a humanist not a feminist. There's a big difference.","Sure you're powerless, sure you're just one person, sure you can't change anything... but you don't have to be miserable about it as well.","I think my speeches are hilarious. I think I'm a natural comedian, but I like denying people the chance to laugh. I want to deny you the relief of the punchline.","Part of the charm of what I do is the fact that it's completely unrelated to everything that came before.","I think it's important to encourage gluttony in all its formats.","I would be humiliated if I found out that anything I did actually became a commercial success.","I'm a very sympathetic person, but that doesn't always come across in my work because I'm too busy being mad at everything.","Think your own thoughts.","Because we have so much eye candy and mind candy, spending so much time trying to pay the rent, all of this conspires to keep us from thinking too hard or taking action from that. Our time is stolen. So much of our daily life is stolen.","Just because my bank account hasn't swelled astronomically I don't consider myself any less of a success.","I'm a total pleasure seeker. I pursue anything that satisfies me. I usually get it. I have specific needs and I know what they are so I can achieve satisfaction.","'Musician' is not a very respected title. I'm not a musician.","The female format is a beautiful one in which to function. Foolhardy as it may be. I change my image all the time, it's whatever suits me at the moment.","I just prefer instrumental. I don't need to hear what other people are singing. And if I need music as a backdrop to work or to think, I need to have that part of the brain clear - I don't need people feeding their fantasies into my vision.","Politics are always involved, even in my love songs.","I'm like a one-woman protest machine.","I've always been inspired by Genet, Henry Miller and Hubert Selby, Jr., who taught me that you've got to tell a bigger truth in whatever you're doing, but the truth is not popular.","People have always asked me, 'Haven't you wanted to sell out?', and it's like, who am I going to sell to?","Honesty works against you in the entertainment field. I try to be a journalist and a documentarian, but that doesn't mean that people are going to embrace it at the moment. The point is I'm leaving the mark of my hysteria and the political hysteria, and that's it... I can only do what I do.","To be in a band, at least according to the rules of rock in the 1970s, one must know how to play an instrument. But rather than waste time solving that problem, No Wavers ignored it. The point was simply to make music, not to learn how first.","You want positive, go elsewhere. Go find a different lie.","Part of what I have to represent is an alternative to this perverted fashion industry concept of what beauty is.","Living in Barcelona, I have my own little ghetto utopia. There are 3,000 ghost towns in Spain, and I've used the images of them a lot in my backdrops for my solo spoken-word stuff. The ghost towns could be from two buildings to 40 - things died out, or there were plagues, the roads don't lead there, whatever.","Two of my favourite books are Henry Miller's 'Tropic of Cancer' and 'Tropic of Capricorn.'","The problem with music was always that the sound system often obliterated the words, and words, not music, have always been what I was about.","I'm separated by other performers with whom I might be lumped, since what I say is so intensely personal. I'm anti-art and anti-poetry. As much as possible, I want to inflict my personal pain on the rest of society.","The American way of life, as I see it, is really the American way of death. Everything is determined by greed and the insatiable desire to be the richest and most powerful. And that desire is limitless.","Aggressive female icons have been chronically demeaned... It's fine for male artists to be angry - they're encouraged to outwardly express their aggression - but women? I've been painted as an aggressive Feminazi because I'm blunt, stubborn, independent, forthright.","I watch the news. It fuels my rage; it informs my work.","The imperial, genocidal war machine never rests, so I don't either."],"Lydia M. Child":["An effort made for the happiness of others lifts above ourselves.","The eye of genius has always a plaintive expression, and its natural language is pathos.","The cure for all the ills and wrongs, the cares, the sorrows, and the crimes of humanity, all lie in the one word 'love'. It is the divine vitality that everywhere produces and restores life.","Belief in oneself is one of the most important bricks in building any successful venture.","You find yourself refreshed in the presence of cheerful people. Why not make an honest effort to confer that pleasure on others? Half the battle is gained if you never allow yourself to say anything gloomy.","Childhood itself is scarcely more lovely than a cheerful, kindly, sunshiny old age.","I was gravely warned by some of my female acquaintances that no woman could expect to be regarded as a lady after she had written a book.","But men never violate the laws of God without suffering the consequences, sooner or later.","Every man deems that he has precisely the trials and temptations which are the hardest of all others for him to bear; but they are so, simply because they are the very ones he most needs.","None speak of the bravery, the might, or the intellect of Jesus; but the devil is always imagined as a being of acute intellect, political cunning, and the fiercest courage. These universal and instinctive tendencies of the human mind reveal much.","A reformer is one who sets forth cheerfully toward sure defeat.","Home - that blessed word, which opens to the human heart the most perfect glimpse of Heaven, and helps to carry it thither, as on an angel's wings.","Misfortune is never mournful to the soul that accepts it; for such do always see that every cloud is an angel's face.","Every human being has, like Socrates, an attendant spirit; and wise are they who obey its signals. If it does not always tell us what to do, it always cautions us what not to do.","It is right noble to fight with wickedness and wrong; the mistake is in supposing that spiritual evil can be overcome by physical means.","That a majority of women do not wish for any important change in their social and civil condition, merely proves that they are the unreflecting slaves of custom."],"Lydia Millet":["In Hiroshima, bombed Aug. 6, 1945, no warning was given of the air attack, and thus no escape was possible for the mostly women, children and old people who fell victim.","Both climate change and extinction are results of our tyranny over the nonhuman world and our domination of, and exploitation of, whole categories of each other - and those, in turn, are clearly linked to agriculture, the cattle-industrial complex, capitalism.","For almost two centuries, American gray wolves, vilified in fact as well as fiction, were the victims of vicious government extermination programs. By the time the Endangered Species Act was passed in 1973, only a few hundred of these once-great predators were left in the lower 48 states.","My motto is, if you love something, don't set it free. No matter how hard it struggles. That would be stupid.","Oil drilling and coal mining are killing endangered wildlife, polluting rivers, creating smog over wilderness areas and blocking wildlife corridors in America's most treasured landscapes.","The grizzly bears that live in and around Yellowstone make up almost half the population in the lower 48 states, and now those bears are at risk.","Wyoming, home to Yellowstone National Park and the Grand Tetons, is also the country's largest coal producer and one of its largest gas drillers. Two-thirds of the state's gas-drilling rigs are on public lands in the increasingly industrialized Greater Green River Basin.","In October 2014, for the first time in almost three-quarters of a century, a gray wolf was seen loping along the forested North Rim of the Grand Canyon, in Arizona. She had walked hundreds of miles, probably from Wyoming or Idaho.","In the 1970s, Safari Club International asked the federal government to approve its import of 1,125 not-yet-killed trophies of 40 endangered species, including gorillas, orangutans and tigers, according to the Humane Society of the United States.","Without elephants, Africa's landscape would be unrecognizable, yet these animals have fallen by the hundreds of thousands as a result of two enormous waves of poaching in this century - one in the 1970s and 1980s, the other, beginning around 2009, now underway.","Most climate debates have focused on cutting the use of fossil fuels. But besides a few high-profile scuffles over fuel extraction in vulnerable wild places like the offshore Arctic, political leaders have ignored fossil fuel production as a necessary piece of climate strategy.","I had hoped that going to Hiroshima would reveal something small, gritty, and precise to countervail the epic quality of historical accounts.","Economic and health statistics, as well as police-violence statistics, shed light on the pressures on American Indian communities and individuals: Indian youths have the highest suicide rate of any United States ethnic group.","In Nagasaki, American planes did drop warning leaflets - but not till Aug. 10, a day after the city was bombed.","Historically, grizzlies ranged from Alaska to Mexico, with at least 50,000 bears living in the western half of the contiguous United States. With European colonization, the bears were shot, poisoned, and trapped to the brink of extinction.","When it comes to American Indians, mainstream America suffers from willful blindness.","What makes 'The Lorax' such a powerful fable is partly its shamelessness. It pulls no punches; it wears its teacher heart on its sleeve.","One man's holy is another woman's sublime.","I advise, if you're stymied by a passage or paragraph or plot point - whether it's for an assignment from the outside world or one that comes only from within - get up from wherever you're sitting, walk outdoors, and do nothing but look at the sky for five minutes. Just stare at that thing. Then execute a small bow and go back in.","I wanted to write about this tropical honeymoon in part because I had the most drastically terrible honeymoon.","I worry about the very pernicious way we elevate and separate ourselves from other beasts, the way we rationalize our comfort and ease, our worship of the self, as healthy. It's enticing, but with a terrible taint of evil.","After numerous generations of people dedicated to killing wolves on the North American continent, one generation devoted itself to letting wolves live.","The Safari Club International has worked the legal system hard to try to keep polar bears - threatened primarily by climate change, but also by hunting - on the list of creatures people can import as trophies after shooting.","The question of one versus two species of African elephants isn't about settling an arcane DNA argument; it's about life or death for these majestic, extraordinary creatures.","I've always been interested in obsessive, insane people.","Children depend mightily on animals for comfort, inspiration, imagination, and art. And parents have long recognized this.","We were a Seuss family. As a child, I read almost all of his books, but the one I loved best was 'The Lorax.'","Shouldn't the cascades of extinction and rapid planetary warming register in our literature?","Fiction should be an ethically safe space, free of fancy ideas. It should be dedicated modestly to relationships or escapism or the needs of luscious voyeurs.","Work-wise, I try not to repeat myself too often. And I have to love whatever I'm doing.","If I can't find a way to love it, I let it go. Kind of the opposite of the popular homily.","'Dept. of Speculation' contains numerous enviable lines.","The comic novels I did when I was in my 20s had a harder edge - less sympathy for people. Or a sympathy that was harder to detect: Characters' foibles and obsessive bents were unrelenting, like caricatures.","On climate change, we have only a handful of years to make massive changes, according to the scientists. The politicians have to act, and only the people can make them, because Royal Dutch Shell's not going to do it.","You need not fear my extinction. Fear my proliferation! I've already reproduced!","I think that young readers have very strong stomachs.","I'm not calculating enough in the way I approach writing.","I don't like names that are clever or made-up sounding.","Names and other proper nouns shouldn't distract from the language.","I don't tend to picture my characters as actors and actresses.","I'm for any woman who loves sloths.","If Oak Flat were a Christian holy site or, for that matter, Jewish or Muslim, no senator who wished to remain in office would dare to sneak a backdoor deal for its destruction into a spending bill - no matter what mining-company profits or jobs might result. But this is Indian religion.","Domestic realism has dominated the American marketplace for decades now. It leeches into literary fiction, and I don't think it's that rich a vein.","No one bought my screenplays.","I wanted to go into the tropics and save animals - and write, of course.","You're lucky if people like your book, and the more people that like it, the luckier I feel.","If you're doing creative work, that work should never feel trivial - even if what you're doing is for hire or lightly intended. Even the mundane doesn't have to be trivial.","If you're going to do a thing, do it fully so that no writing you give the world misrepresents you - so that nothing you put out there is like a sad regift you couldn't throw away and had to find a place for.","In 1805, the explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, making their way across the West, were warned by American Indian tribes of grizzly bears' awesome strength.","I've seen a few wild grizzly bears, mostly in Alaska and British Columbia, and always from a distance. But each grizzly I've caught sight of was as fearsome and sublime as the last. You never get used to their raw power and massive bodies, or the mysterious intelligence in their dark, close-set eyes.","I never seem to leave L.A., though I left L.A.","L.A., for me, is a perfect microcosm of America - because it's so profligate, and so glamorous, and so anti-intellectual, finally.","Most of my books have something to do with L.A.","People from the rest of the state tend to hate Phoenix, with that typical resentment of the boroughs and the towns for the big city.","I've always wondered: is there really any access to the White House?","People who are obsessed amuse me.","I don't write the same book twice.","As soon as a regular guy like Bill Clinton becomes the president, he wears a mantle of greatness. He's the president.","I like to amuse myself.","Everyone desires to laugh sometimes, and I want to make that available.","There has to be space for play in literature. We all need some breathing room.","It's a friendly act to write a lighthearted book.","Marriage is like the romantic ideal, and yet the trappings around it and the culture about it are really the opposite of that.","There is a lot of contradictions of mermaids as a symbol. I'm always interested in contradictions.","The Free Body Culture gave me a gift I might never have received had I refused to play along. It left me with an acute sense of the absurd - one I still cherish - to be there among my fellow apes, awkward and less than half-willing, aiming and missing, leaping, landing and wincing.","When I was 16, I went to Berlin - West Berlin, since at that time a wall still divided the city - to live for three months with a family on an exchange program.","I came to understand that a German nudist, in 1984, loved little more than to work on his or her tan.","At 16, I was more resilient and easygoing than I am now.","I used to try to write around the edges, but now I try to walk a more direct line.","Snark describes a cynical position, and I'm not interested in that.","I love irony.","I think the best fiction is a form of psychological suspense, even though I don't really write in that idiom.","It seems to me that the time for subtlety in our American life has passed.","Do we seek delicate phraseology in politics or other forms of public life? We do not.","We paint a slow picture. You can see the brushstrokes. We don't get to the point, and sometimes when we do, our readers don't notice, in fact. It's so couched in nuance, it can fly right over a person's head. 'What was that you said? I couldn't quite make it out.'","At writing workshops, they taught us to show, not tell - well, showing takes time.","The summer after I got divorced, my children asked to sleep in my bed again. It would be the first time we'd shared a bed since they were infants.","I have a king bed, one of those memory-foam mattresses that doesn't jiggle as you get in or out. Even if you cleaved it down the middle with a pickax, the thing wouldn't tremble. It's practically earthquake-proof.","I can be pretty dense about my own basic needs, when my focus is getting through the many small tasks of a day's work and a day's caretaking.","Pugs are creatures of habit.","About half of all potential future global warming emissions from United States fossil fuels lie in oil, gas and coal buried beneath our public lands, controlled by the federal government and owned by the American people - and not yet leased to private industry for fuel extraction.","When 'Watchmen' was published in 1986, the vast majority of comics readers deemed it a watershed in comics history. The 12-part serial comic book was widely acclaimed as a genius subversion of the superhero genre, and it did much to popularize comics to adults.","Indeed, the hype around 'Watchmen' is its curse. If you want to enjoy the comic for what it is, ignore the attributions of literariness and the novelistic pretensions with which some critics have imbued it. This isn't high culture, and it doesn't pretend to be. It's good, juicy pulp fiction with a little nuclear apocalypse thrown in.","Within the macho-melodrama tropes of the superhero genre, it's fair to say 'Watchmen' stands out for its rich entertainment, its darkness, and its lurid pleasures. Its vividly drawn panels, moody colors and lush imagery make its popularity well-deserved, if disproportionate.","The male domination and chauvinism of the comics form is either being wittily lampooned in 'Watchmen' or handily perpetuated, depending on whom you ask.","Without even knowing why, we believe that to learn how to be human - which we have many years to do, for human beings have longer childhoods than any other species, a feature that to biologists and philosophers alike is one of our race's distinguishing characteristics - children must be surrounded by animal imagery.","We read our children stories starring elephants and monkeys and bears to teach them about nobility, curiosity and courage, to warn them against selfishness and stubbornness.","If the dinosaurs are any indication, there's a place in our pantheon for the extinct. My son has a blue plushy allosaurus he calls Spot-Spot, with whom he often sleeps.","In December 2011, a wild gray wolf set foot in California, the first sighting in almost a century. He'd wandered in from Oregon, looking for a mate.","Trophy hunters are not Everyman. These world-traveling endangered-species shooters are a far cry from the hunters who spend weekends in the American outback near their suburban or rural homes.","More than two million years ago, mammoths and Asian elephants took different evolutionary paths - and around the same time, according to DNA research, so did their lumbering relatives in Africa.","African elephants have long been thought of as a single species, but a critical mass of genetic studies now proves there are two."],"Lykke Li":["Most things in life come as a surprise.","I don't want to break someone's heart, but you can't control that. A broken heart happens; that's inevitable.","If you're being ignored, that's a good time to concentrate on finding yourself and creating your own mystery.","I do everything: I'll have a green juice, then a melted chocolate ice cream. I stay up very late, I get up very early.","For men, it's about finding the perfect shoe or the perfect pants that will last you through the years. That's how I want to shop: sustainable, classic, great quality.","I struggle with myself every day - I am a lonesome person. I talk to my family - and I connect to some people deeply along the way - but I am a restless soul. Singing is the most immediate relief.","I felt such a deep connection with dolphins. I felt like they were the only ones who understood me.","I am such a complex person. I have so many different layers of my personality to choose from. I am super-sensitive, and I am super-strong.","It's amazing, coconut oil. I use it as a moisturizer. I put it in my hair when I want a kind of greasy look. I take off my makeup with it. I put a little bit in my coffee. I have coconut oil with everything.","I was 21 and homeless - such a broken, lost woman.","The profession I have keeps dragging me into drama and taking me away from baking, flowering and gardening.","The problem is, when I talk about heartbreak or whatever, people want to melt it down to some break-up of a relationship, but it's not about that. If you're a sensitive person, just stepping outside can be heartbreaking.","The first tape I got was Madonna's 'Immaculate Collection.' I'm inspired by the way she started from nothing and didn't have a big musical talent, but had a big dream.","Mum is a photographer, and Dad does world music and plays almost every instrument except for drums.","It's a very proactive thing to be dealing with your darkness and getting it out of your system. So it doesn't have to be in your system.","It's important that the way you dress tells a story and reveals something about you and your philosophy.","Some people watch comedy to relax. I watch '21 Grams.' I can recognize sadness and tragedy really easily because it's been with me forever.","I honestly kind of hate shopping. My favorite places to shop are rich old lady consignment stores.","I went to 11 different schools. It was a fantastic adventure, but I was incredibly sensitive and needed a bit more stability.","It's the ultimate task to do something stripped back, so you're not hiding behind anything.","My favourite festival experience is a show at midnight with the moon blazing and a crowd full of open hearts ready to dance.","I used to get really sick. I would go to the doctor with all these ailments, and they would tell me I needed to be at home. I didn't even really understand what that meant because since I was a baby, I've always been moving, moving, and then touring.","I think pop culture underestimates people. The message is, 'Being yourself is the worst thing you could possibly be.' But people are still attracted to it.","I'm not so interested in being indie just for the sake of being indie.","I don't necessarily love all the collaborations that I've done; the more I work with other people, the more I realize that I want to work with myself.","I don't relate to the 'Twilight' books or movies at all, but I'm obsessed with it as a pop culture phenomenon - all these people just screaming like it was the Beatles.","People comment on how you look; it's so unnecessary. I just wanted people to listen to what I have to say instead of focusing on anything else.","I don't think Neil Young has a beautiful voice, but it's something that grabs you, and the songs are so good.","I'm from Sweden, so I don't enjoy winter at all; there's nothing cute about it.","I was totally romanticizing the idea of Los Angeles when the Doors, Joni Mitchell, and Neil Young were hanging out there.","The first thing you do when you get off tour is let off some steam and, you know, have some type of big breakdown.","Touring is really about being on edge the whole time - you're like a racing horse: you've just got to be on. You've got to pull it together.","Sometimes when I write songs, I don't know what they're about, and it just suddenly comes to me.","I'll always be in some type of turmoil. So what I've tried to do is just surrender to that.","It's in every person's life, around 27 to 29 years old, the stars and the planets align themselves to exactly the way they were when you were born. You're faced with yourself. There's no running away.","I am deeply in tune with my heart and core, and it's made me a better writer, artist, and most of all woman. It's made me more myself.","When I play, I'm so in the moment that I can't really remember what happened afterwards. It's a rare experience for a thinking person like me.","I love listening to demos. They're so raw.","I was a total floral hippie as a child so when I finally could make my own choices, I've been living in different black suit jackets and been really drawn to masculine clothes.","Music and fashion are a sign of the times and a reflection of what people want and need at this very day and age.","I'm interested in a lot of different sounds and types of music.","I think everything in life comes in threes: heartbreak and all that. You've got to do the full round in order to learn.","I've always been a person that is searching for truth and always wants to go further, deeper.","My favorite thing in the world is to have just a big dinner with friends and just sit and talk about their life and their difficulties and all of that.","I always feel like I've been slightly misunderstood. As a woman, you get judged for appearances or things like that I don't really care about.","If anything, I want to be seen as a singer-songwriter rather than a pop artist.","If you take the hard facts of a failed relationship, it's pretty grim. But if you make an album out of it, and if the violins represent all the tears, you create something magical out of something very normal.","I'm more old school: I want to be like Keith Richards on stage. It's not interesting to see straight-from-runway clothes slapped on an artist. It's more interesting when you see people who have their own style.","The thing is, if you're in this world, you have to do things for yourself, not for others, because everyone will judge you for anything.","I'm a very melancholic kind of person. I don't know why; I think certain people are born a certain way.","I'm going to be like Benjamin Button; I'm just going to grow younger. I will probably be happy, fat, with kids and looking back and thinking, 'I was such a angry young woman.'","I remember watching films in my teenage years, and you'd be in love with Leonardo DiCaprio, and then a song would come on. You'd love that song forever; it changed your life.","There's more discomfort being an old soul or a person who questions a lot of things. I'm young, but I'm old.","I always strive for freedom: freedom of thought and expression.","I'm always looking for silhouettes that seem 'invisible' to the eye, as in that it's so well-tailored to your body that you won't even notice what you're wearing. It needs to be dramatic in a subtle way.","I will grab any opportunity I can to learn something new.","I love pouring my heart out. People don't want to hear you whine when you're with friends, so you can sing about it instead - it's the best outlet.","I'm actually a really shy person. I just really enjoy being in studio; I don't go out much.","You can become quite blase, and also, I have no sense of home; I don't have roots. I've never had that feeling that someone else is going to take care of me, ever. I don't trust people.","I'm just not interested in getting judged or getting people to love me. Being seen and taking my photo and having to follow this schedule all the time, I don't enjoy it.","I will never get to Lady Gaga's status. That's not something I want.","Driving, for me, means power and freedom. The feeling that I can go anywhere I want at any time is exhilarating.","I don't feel Swedish. In fact, my father tells me to get out of here as soon as I can.","I lived five years in Portugal and then spent winters in Nepal or India.","I want people to have a good time. It's boring only to hear singer/songwriters spilling their guts.","I don't live anywhere. I have always dreamed of moving out of my country because Sweden is boring.","During the day, I don't wear much makeup; I only put on makeup for the show.","Being on tour really takes a toll, so you have to find ways to stay healthy.","Where I've been hasn't influenced my music. It's more what I listen to. You can find music everywhere, so moving hasn't really influenced my music, more me as a person.","I knew I wanted to be an artist, but I never took music lessons. I was just playing around in front of the mirror and being silly, then suddenly I started making songs.","When I was very little, I was into Michael Jackson. At six or seven, it was Madonna, but she's not what she used to be. I've been into everything from Edith Piaf to Joe Strummer to the Velvet Underground to Suicide to A Tribe Called Quest to African music.","I'm a vagabond. I live out of one suitcase. I feel very comfortable in black. I feel very uncomfortable in anything else than black.","My dream is to one day just be me and my guitar. I'm working myself to the core. Who am I, underneath everything else? I'm still on that journey, to find that core.","The music that I listen to is very minimalistic. I listen to a lot of old blues that is just guitar and vocals."],"Lyle Alzado":["I don't really trust a sane person.","I never met a man I didn't want to fight."],"Lyle Kessler":["My best writing has to do with an internal process that I'm working out unconsciously and put into my characters.","In the case of the 'Saint' movie, I did do some research. I visited a few shelters. But usually, my stuff just comes out. I don't have any control over that.","I was born in Philadelphia, and I've tried to escape that city all my life. I end up writing plays that force me back to Philadelphia, at least psychologically if not physically.","'Orphans' reflects unconscious elements in myself that were, at the time, indigestible and butting up against each other in my psyche; issues I wasn't really in touch with but was trying to put into a dramatic framework.","As for Philadelphia, you know what it is like? Sink holes. You stand in the earth and it opens up and you're sucked down. I'm never going to escape Philadelphia."],"Lyle Lovett":["You don't have to have anything in common with people you've known since you were five. With old friends, you've got your whole life in common.","You're saying something with your appearance whether you mean to or not, so you may as well mean to.","Dad often told me, 'My job is to help my boss do his job and make him look good.' That was my dad's objective. Everything about the way he conducted himself was to communicate support for his superiors and respect for his coworkers. The way he dressed was his starting point in that communication.","Tipping your hat to a lady is good form. If you're at a dinner table, you'd most certainly take your hat off - cowboy hat, baseball hat, or otherwise.","In school, I didn't speak up often in class. I was never the person to yell out an answer. If I knew it, I might whisper it to my buddy and let him answer. I kept quiet.","It's really a lot easier to write about things that are problematic. Who wants to hear how happy you are?","If you forget the words to your own song, you can always claim artistic license. Forget the words to the national anthem, and you're screwed.","The idea that we humans are good-natured, politically correct, nonjudgmental beings is pure fantasy. We are, at the very least, judgmental.","The most important thing you can do as a performer is to be yourself, or be an onstage version of yourself. If you're not being true to yourself, and somebody likes that other version of you, you're kind of stuck.","Somehow you can tell the difference when a song is written just to get on the radio and when what someone does is their whole life. That comes through in Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Willie Nelson. There is no separating their life from their music.","Fortunately, I've never had a job.","Singing your own songs is all about individual expression.","I don't feel like I'm on a mission. I'm trying to play music that I like to play and like to listen to.","I played guitar when I was young and never really considered it as a way to make a living.","I'm really in no danger of being perceived as a famous movie actor!","I am limited by what I can think of to do-my choices are not so great.","It's important to be successful enough to be able to keep doing what you love.","Both my parents worked, so I was home alone a lot, and I would listen to their records. They belonged to the Columbia House record club, so they had records!","I enjoyed hearing people do their own songs. I became attracted to singer-songwriters. I became interested in them as people; was curious about what they wanted to say.","It's difficult to get started-when it comes to dealing with an unknown quantity, people are reluctant to trust their own opinion. It helps if two or three people give you a boost.","You can't second-guess your audience. You can only do what you think is right. If you do that, your audience will appreciate you.","I've been lucky to be able to make the records I've wanted to make. The record company has never pressured me to cut certain songs.","I've always thought that writing isn't really that hard. It's having a good idea that's hard.","If someone gives you a belt buckle, it's like a piece of jewelry. It has the same sort of emotional significance. It would be something you would intend to keep forever.","Wear what you want to wear. Do what you want to do. Be who you are. Pick out your own clothes. Be a man. And if that's too much to ask, as it almost always is for me, think of someone you consider to be a man and pretend to be like him. I pretend to be like my dad.","Horses teach you patience and how to do things the right way so you can get the right result.","My first performance was in second grade with my friend Rodney Fisher, and we worked up versions of 'Long Tall Texan' and 'I Want to Hold Your Hand.' It gave me a little early confidence that I could actually do this music thing.","My parents worked for Exxon, and they gave me every chance to take part in music. I took guitar lessons, and I was in the choir at school.","I've gotten to work with some wonderful directors and people who have been great teachers to me.","A woman comes to a table, and you're supposed to get up. Period. But I don't always do it. In general, you're supposed to do it every time. But sometimes you're seated against the wall, and it's awkward.","Never guess a woman's age. Never guess a woman's weight. Never even talk about weight in front of a woman. And never, ever ask a woman when she's due.","Women always go through the door first. Even ardent feminists would admit it's nice. It's not an acknowledgment of women as the weaker sex; it's perhaps an acknowledgment of women as the stronger sex.","My music has always been sort of in between categories. Sometimes record stores - back when there were record stores - they'd put my records in the country music section, but other record stores would put my records in the pop or even the rock section. As long as it's in the store somewhere, I'm OK with it.","I sort of cringe when I hear myself say the word 'work.' Getting to do something you love to do never really feels like work.","I'm not really a competitive person, and I'm not naturally comfortable in front of people.","Growing up, the last thing I ever thought I'd do is be an entertainer.","The first time I toured with the 'Large Band' in 1988, I got so tired. If I just stood still anywhere, I could go to sleep. I was that tired. But I had to perform. And I did, and after that tour, I was much less fretful about going out onstage.","Helen Hunt is terrific, and I got to do a couple of guest spots with Helen and Paul Reiser on 'Mad About You.'","One of my favorite things is when people will ask for a song that I hadn't planned to play. It is really fun to see if you can remember something, and you don't always. I mean, sometimes it's just crash and burn.","Every crowd is different. But that's something that I enjoy, and you can feel it in the first few seconds when you walk out on stage. You know, how a crowd is.","When I first was trying to play the clubs around Houston to start playing my own songs, songwriters like Eric Taylor and Vince Bell and Townes Van Zandt and Don Sanders were just really encouraging to me and would let me sit in with them during their sets and introduce me to the person that owned and booked the club.","Songwriters aren't always performers, and even performing songwriters aren't always the kind of show-biz performers you think they'd be.","As a songwriter, you try your best to write a good song, and you like nothing better than hearing a good song. It's easy to admire a great song, and you want to share out of enthusiasm.","I've always worked with people who have been supporters of me creatively.","I've just always written songs in a style that appeal to me personally.","I've never made a dime from a record sale in the history of my record deal. I've been very happy with my sales, and certainly my audience has been very supportive. I make a living going out and playing shows.","Records are very powerful promotional tools to go out and be able to play on the road, but you do have to think about it as a way of sustaining itself at some point."],"Lyman Abbott":["Every life is a march from innocence, through temptation, to virtue or vice.","Every life is march from innocence, through temptation, to virtue or vice.","The very essence of rationalism is that it assumes that the reason is the highest faculty in man and the lord of all the rest.","I abhor a hoe. I am fond of flowers but not of dirt, and had rather buy them than cultivate them.","The highest qualities of character... must be earned.","A child is a beam of sunlight from the Infinite and Eternal, with possibilities of virtue and vice- but as yet unstained.","I cannot harness a horse. I am afraid of a cow.","It is easy to condemn, it is better to pity.","Patience is passion tamed.","Religion is not a conclusion of the reason."],"Lyman Beecher":["No great advance has been made in science, politics, or religion without controversy.","Never chase a lie. Let it alone, and it will run itself to death."],"Lyman Trumbull":["Each state, so that it does not abridge the great fundamental rights belonging, under the Constitution, to all citizens, may grant or withhold such civil rights as it pleases; all that is required is that, in this respect, its laws shall be impartial.","The bill neither confers nor abridges the rights of anyone but simply declares that in civil rights there shall be equality among all classes of citizens and that all alike shall be subject to the same punishment."],"Lyn Nofziger":["Freedom is our most precious commodity and if we are not eternally vigilant, government will take it all away. Individual freedom demands individual responsibility.","I cannot show remorse because I do not believe I am guilty.","One of the things that bothers me most is the growing belief in the country that security is more important than freedom. It ain't.","These things I believe: that government should butt out.","The executive branch has grown too strong, the judicial branch too arrogant and the legislative branch too stupid.","I don't like government, it's just that simple.","That foreign trade should be fair rather than free.","I'm not a social friend of the Reagans. That's by their choice and by mine. They don't drink enough.","Several things about Reagan are unusual in a public man. He was not a typical politician at all, but a private man in public life.","Government should work to insure the rights of the individual, not plot to take them away.","I sometimes lie awake at night trying to think of something funny that Richard Nixon said.","That guns do more than protect us from criminals; more importantly, they protect us from the ongoing threat of government.","A better educated electorate might change the reason many persons vote.","That government is not a necessary good but an unavoidable evil.","The best thing going for us is Al Gore. I cannot conceive how the American people could elect him. On the other hand, I couldn't conceive how they could elect a Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton - especially Clinton in '96.","I think the American people have become more reliant upon government and less reliant upon themselves and that they now tend to put security ahead of freedom, but I think freedom is the most important aspect of our lives.","Most politicians - those people who live, eat and breathe politics - like to sit around and talk about politics and tell political war stories. Reagan didn't do that. His war stories were movie war stories and Hollywood war stories. He loved that.","He and Reagan were not at all alike, because Reagan is an optimist and Dick Nixon wasn't. Yet in some ways they were alike. Neither really liked to talk on the telephone, for instance. And, in a lot of respects, both of them were very much loners.","The reason this country continues its drift toward socialism and big nanny government is because too many people vote in the expectation of getting something for nothing, not because they have a concern for what is good for the country."],"Lynda Barry":["We don't create a fantasy world to escape reality. We create it to be able to stay.","I am about as detailed as a shadow.","Love is an exploding cigar we willingly smoke.","I need to be cheered up a lot. I think funny people are people who need to be cheered up.","Sometimes I think I'm the craziest person on the planet.","Playing and fun are not the same thing, though when we grow up we may forget that and find ourselves mixing up playing with happiness. There can be a kind of amnesia about the seriousness of playing, especially when we played by ourselves.","There was a beautiful time in the beginning when I just did it and didn't analyze the consequences, but I think that time ends in everyone's work.","The happy ending is hardly important, though we may be glad it's there. The real joy is knowing that if you felt the trouble in the story, your kingdom isn't dead.","'Good Times' is a story about the loss of innocence, how adults are responsible for their actions but children aren't.","I do love to eavesdrop. It's inspirational, not only for subject matter but for actual dialogue, the way people talk.","I am not sure how much I would like being married if I wasn't married to him. A man who likes flea markets and isn't gay? I knew I was lucky.","If I didn't try to eavesdrop on every bus ride I take or look for the humor when I go for a walk, I would just be depressed all the time.","Humor is such a wonderful thing, helping you realize what a fool you are but how beautiful that is at the same time.","If it is your time, love will track you down like a cruise missile.","If I had had me for a student I would have thrown me out of class immediately.","I wasn't afraid to be laughed at or be loud.","I listen like mad to any conversation taking place next to me just trying to hear why this is funny. Women's restrooms are especially great. I wash my hands twice waiting for people to come in and start talking.","I go to work the minute I open my eyes.","I do dumb stuff, like playing my favorite dumb Barry White song and lip-synching into the mirror so it looks like his voice is coming out of my mouth.","Cartoonist was the weirdest name I finally let myself have. I would never say it. When I heard it I silently thought, what an awful word.","I started doing cartoons when I was about 21. I never thought I would be a cartoonist. It happened behind my back. I was always a painter and drawer.","I was unable to sleep and I would stay up and draw these little cartoons. Then a friend showed them around. Before I knew it I was a cartoonist.","The strips are nearly effortless unless I am really emotionally upset, a wreck.","Remember how you used to be able to feel your bed breathing and the walls spinning when you were a kid?","People think that whatever I put into strips has happened to me in my life.","In life there are always these things happening if you can just get the joke.","I've gotten a lot of livid letters about the awfulness of my work. I've never known what to make of it. Why do people bother to write if they hate what I do?","Race and class are the easiest divisions. It's very stupid.","I used to live a very social life and never spend much solitary time looking at birds or reading.","Going on Letterman is like going off the high dive. It's exhilarating, but after a while it wasn't the kind of thrill I enjoyed.","Love will make a way out of no way.","I grew up in a house that had a whole lot of trouble. As much trouble as you could imagine.","I run a tight ship, but I try and make it seem like I'm not doing that at all.","My goal on my bucket list is to write a romantic comedy movie.","Whenever I do a book, I'm usually guided by a question or something that I'm trying to tease out.","I found myself compelled - like this weird, shameful compulsion - to draw cute animals.","I live in constant fear of being fired or dropped for that dark part of my work I can't control.","The library was open for one hour after school let out. I hid there, looking at art books and reading poetry.","I remember my comic strips being called 'new wave.' It bugged me.","I look crazy. I know I do. Been true since I was a kid!","My mom didn't want me to go to college. She didn't want me to read - when I read, I may as well have been holding a pineapple.","It's one thing to have a relationship, to lay your hands on it, and another to make it continue and last. That's something I haven't talked about much in my comic strips, and it's certainly something I'm interested in.","Part of a horror movie has to be a bit fakey for me to really enjoy it. The new ones are so realistic that they distract me from the ride through the horror.","For horror movies, color is reassuring because, at least in older films, it adds to the fakey-ness.","Kids don't plan to play. They don't go: 'Barbie, Ken, you ready to play? It's gonna be a three-act.'","I think of images as an immune system and a transit system.","For 'Picture This,' I wanted it to be a drawing book that didn't have any instructions about drawing, beyond the real simple stuff you'd find like in a Bazooka bubblegum wrapper, or in 'Highlights' magazine. I just wanted it to be feelings about looking and seeing and pictures.","'What It Is' was based on this class I've been teaching for 10 years - I wanted to write a book about writing that didn't mention stuff like story structure, protagonists, and all those things that we know about only because they already exist in stories.","When you learn about stories in school, you get it backward. You start to think 'Oh, the reason these things are in stories is because a book said I need to put these things in there.' You need a death, as my husband says, and you need a little sidekick with a saying like 'Skivel-dee-doo!'","When I work on a book, I usually start with a question. And I don't sit around and go 'I need to write a book. What's a good question?' It will be a question that's just clanging around in my head. So for 'What It Is,' it was this idea of 'What is an image?'","It's much easier to teach writing, because people are less shy about writing. If they're in a group, nobody can see what they're writing. When you're drawing, people get a little more nervous.","In my writing class, we never, ever talk about the writing - ever. We never address a story that's been read. I also won't let anyone look at the person who's reading. No eye contact; everybody has to draw a spiral. And I would like to do a drawing class where we could talk about anything except for the drawing. No one could even mention it.","When I was working on 'Freddie,' I had been trying to write it on a computer for many, many years, but that delete button just won't let anything go forward.","The thing that really struck me when I went to junior high was class. I grew up on a pretty poor street, but the school district I was in included some fine neighborhoods - so I got to know a couple of the kids from those places and went to their houses and experienced such culture shock.","I tried to be like the richer kids as much as I could because I wanted to live on their streets, at least hang out on their streets and eat their amazing food and walk barefoot on their shag carpets. I became something of a pest in that way, and in general, other people's parents didn't like me.","My strips are not always funny, and they can be pretty grim at times, and I know I lose readers because of it, but I can't do anything about it - my work is very much connected to something I need to do in order to feel stable.","It's not hard for me to be funny in front of people, but most of that is just horrified nerves taking the form of what makes people laugh, and afterwards I'd always feel dreadfully depressed, kind of self-induced bi-polar disorder.","Remember when you were in school and the teacher would put a picture under an overhead projector so you could see it on the wall? God, I loved that. Tellya the truth, I used to look at that beam of light and think it was God.","When you think about it, giving up your 'real' personality is a small price to pay for the richness of 'living happily ever after' with an actual man!","The minute you understand racism, you're responsible for being racist. It's like eating from the tree of knowledge.","I believe a kid who is playing is not alone. There is something brought alive during play, and this something, when played with, seems to play back.","No one stopped me from playing when I was alone, but there were times when I wasn't able to, though I wanted to... There were times when nothing played back. Writers call it 'writer's block.' For kids there are other names for that feeling, though kids don't usually know them.","My childhood is always going to limit me.","When you are little, you will draw pictures for no reason."],"Lynda Carter":["People always want me to talk about Wonder Woman, so I do.","I want to do everything right now! This very minute. I am impatient, but yes I have goals. To be a real well-respected actress whom people know they can rely on to do a good job... whether they like me as a person or not!","I'm an adventurer and I enjoy all types of things, and eating is a part of that. It's just too bad we have to watch what we eat.","My only interest in women's clothes is what's underneath them.","You want to see women your own age in films.","I just want my audiences to be entertained and feel like they're part of the show. I want to show them a good time and create an experience they're going to enjoy.","I try to avoid cheese, dairy and a lot of meat, but I do like them."],"Lynda Obst":["Directing is the last frontier for women in the movie business. We are studio heads, we are producers and we are writers, but we are not directors in any numbers.","I think there are always actor parts, and then there are movie-star parts, and an actor's always an actor until he does a movie-star part.","Every single one of us who has been a 'Woman in Film' for more than five minutes is sick of the phrase 'Women in Film.'","When I was starting out, the first women studio heads and writers were just getting into their perches - development execs learning their chops.","The lack of women directors is a sad fact of life. Kathryn Bigelow's thrilling Best Director win may help turn things around."],"Lynda Resnick":["When you wake up each morning, you can choose to be happy or choose to be sad. Unless some terrible catastrophe has occurred the night before, it is pretty much up to you. Tomorrow morning, when the sun shines through your window, choose to make it a happy day.","Learn to expect less from life and more from yourself. Accept the changes that life throws at you. Remember, your destiny is pretty much in your hands. So, as your mom may have told you, keep them clean.","You will learn more from your failures than your successes - so embrace those mistakes, as difficult as that sounds, and grow from them. When a project is successful, you're never really sure why, because so many elements come into play. However, when you fail, you always know why. That is how you learn and grow.","Art is a critical component in a well-rounded education. Art is the level playing field - no matter how rich or poor, tall or short, pretty or ugly to the bone, if you can draw, you can find personal fulfillment and build self-confidence. Art is the highest achievement of mankind.","Any entrepreneur worth their salt knows that their brand is worthless if it doesn't somehow contribute to society or the overall good of the planet.","Some of the most innocuous inventions have proven earth-shattering, with reverberations felt around the planet. The Internet is the poster child for disruptive technology, but even such inventions as Amazon's Kindle and Apple's iPod have rocked their respective industries by changing how we entertain ourselves.","As places of learning, schools have a responsibility to also educate on nutrition, which we all can agree is far more important than algebra, no matter what your third-period teacher claims.","Epilepsy is a disease in the shadows. Patients are often reluctant to admit their condition - even to close family, friends or co-workers - because there's still a great deal of stigma and mystery surrounding the disease that plagued such historical figures as Julius Caesar, Edgar Allan Poe and Lewis Carroll.","I remember when we first bought Teleflora, I made a very expensive mistake when I produced a brochure with the slogan, 'The way America sends love.' The bouquets and prices I pictured could not be duplicated by the florist - they were too expensive. I had relied on people I thought were in touch with the marketplace.","You don't have to be Pope Julius to have great art in your house.","I believe that everyone collects. I think collecting is in our blood as humans.","When people affected by epilepsy are reluctant to expose their condition, the public remains in the dark about it - a tragic irony that has made patient care and raising funds for research more than challenging.","My main issue is sustainability of the Earth, and protection of those animals and people who dwell here.","A pomegranate is filled with rubies when you open it up. Diamonds may be a girl's best friend - but not for me. I love rubies; they're great over necks, you know.","Pomegranate juice has staying power. It's not a fad. Once people have tasted POM Wonderful, they say they are addicted - and it's a good addiction to have.","Jackie Kennedy was the most appropriately dressed first lady we've ever had. You can see how lasting Jackie's style is.","Never be afraid to ask when you don't understand. It sounds like a little thing, but awful things have happened, international incidents have flared, and markets have collapsed just because people couldn't make sense of what was being said. They didn't ask 'why?' because they thought it would make them look stupid.","Whenever education budgets get tightened, art programs are the first to get cut. Like the enduring popularity of reality TV, this never ceases to amaze me.","If art means as much to you as it does to me, or even if you're just exploring the art world for the first time, I invite you to turn off the boob tube, pry the Wii controllers from your kids' hands, and drag them to a museum.","Your kids might feel more apt to try some art of their own after viewing contemporary works that are far less intimidating than those of the Old Masters.","The thinner a newspaper or magazine is - due to reduced revenue from advertising dollars - the less editorial content because of the standard ad-to-editorial ratio, and the less money there is to support investigative journalism.","Since the advent of the Internet - more recently compounded by blogging - everyone can be a published voice. Any cowardly, anonymous anger-monger can have an audience of thousands. That doesn't make them a journalist any more than my throwing an onion and a few carrots into a pot of boiling water makes me Julia Child.","The voice I've chosen to turn to is that of NPR. With a reputation for some of the finest journalism in the country, the nonprofit organization is renowned for its unbiased stance - to the point that it's been accused of being both conservative and liberal.","Just as TurboTax simplified much of the tax process, so has the colossally scary legal process been reduced to a kinder, gentler series of mouse clicks and 'Continue' buttons by LegalZoom, the online leader that has become so prominent in its market that it's practically a generic.","The most common way to grow a business is by overseeing each and every aspect of the company - the 'ground up' method.","Most Fortune 500 companies began as small start-ups whose entrepreneurial founders slowly developed the infrastructure, hired the staff, sourced manufacturers or built their own factory, and created distribution, sales, and marketing plans.","The film 'Slumdog Millionaire' portrays the spirit you feel in India. For those who haven't been there, the film says it all.","What is your Unique Selling Proposition? What makes you different than your competitors? Wrap your advertising message around that USP and communicate it in a clear and concise manner.","If you have a business website, make it stickier; redo the merchandising often and try new things until you hit the right homepage... then try and beat that. The most important audience drivers on the Internet are paid search and key word optimization. Concentrate on those. They are very inexpensive compared to banner advertising.","I can taste a meal and tell you every spice that's in there. I have taste buds like Betty Grable's legs - they should be insured with Lloyd's of London.","The POM bottle is sublime, in a way. When you go into a supermarket, you hear that noise everywhere: 'Buy me! I'm going to save your life! I'm going to make you thin!' When you come to that POM bottle, it's like an oasis of calm.","I was trained as a fine artist. I went to a progressive public school in Pennsylvania that developed these talents, but I was never able to apply to a decent college because I had no math, no science - I was allowed to just paint all day and write.","I want POM Wonderful to be within arm's reach of everyone who wants it. That is the biggest service I can do.","As a child, I was tortured because my mother was a brilliant seamstress who made most of my clothes. I was despised by the children at school because I looked like I was going to an opening every day. We weren't wealthy at all; we lived in a row house in Philadelphia.","I like a hem below my knee even though I was blessed with fairly good gams.","We are very proud of the diverse talents within the Franklin Mint's own walls.","I'm a closet Catholic. I love the iconography of the saints. There was a point in my life when I was going to convert to Catholicism, but I didn't want my grandmother spinning around in her grave like a rotisserie chicken.","The best thing about art is that it is the one luxury in life that can be enjoyed by everyone. And it lasts forever.","I feel like everything I ever did in my life led me to the Franklin Mint."],"Lyndon B. Johnson":["Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose.","Peace is a journey of a thousand miles and it must be taken one step at a time.","Until justice is blind to color, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is unconcerned with the color of men's skins, emancipation will be a proclamation but not a fact.","You aren't learning anything when you're talking.","Every man has a right to a Saturday night bath.","We have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society, but upward to the Great Society.","The guns and the bombs, the rockets and the warships, are all symbols of human failure.","Our purpose in Vietnam is to prevent the success of aggression. It is not conquest, it is not empire, it is not foreign bases, it is not domination. It is, simply put, just to prevent the forceful conquest of South Vietnam by North Vietnam.","We live in a world that has narrowed into a neighborhood before it has broadened into a brotherhood.","The noblest search is the search for excellence.","There are no problems we cannot solve together, and very few that we can solve by ourselves.","We have talked long enough in this country about equal rights. It is time now to write the next chapter - and to write it in the books of law.","The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which imprison men because they are different from other men.","We must open the doors of opportunity. But we must also equip our people to walk through those doors.","If future generations are to remember us more with gratitude than sorrow, we must achieve more than just the miracles of technology. We must also leave them a glimpse of the world as it was created, not just as it looked when we got through with it.","A President's hardest task is not to do what is right, but to know what is right.","When I was young, poverty was so common that we didn't know it had a name.","When the burdens of the presidency seem unusually heavy, I always remind myself it could be worse. I could be a mayor.","The atomic bomb certainly is the most powerful of all weapons, but it is conclusively powerful and effective only in the hands of the nation which controls the sky.","Jerry Ford is so dumb he can't fart and chew gum at the same time.","A man without a vote is man without protection.","We did not choose to be the guardians of the gate, but there is no one else.","The presidency has made every man who occupied it, no matter how small, bigger than he was; and no matter how big, not big enough for its demands.","Education is not a problem. Education is an opportunity.","I believe we can continue the Great Society while we fight in Vietnam.","What we won when all of our people united must not be lost in suspicion and distrust and selfishness and politics. Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as president.","The men who have guided the destiny of the United States have found the strength for their tasks by going to their knees. This private unity of public men and their God is an enduring source of reassurance for the people of America.","The fifth freedom is freedom from ignorance.","When I was a boy we didn't wake up with Vietnam and have Cyprus for lunch and the Congo for dinner.","If one morning I walked on top of the water across the Potomac River, the headline that afternoon would read: 'President Can't Swim.'","Greater love hath no man than to attend the Episcopal Church with his wife.","The last thing I wanted to do was to be a wartime President.","What convinces is conviction. Believe in the argument you're advancing. If you don't you're as good as dead. The other person will sense that something isn't there, and no chain of reasoning, no matter how logical or elegant or brilliant, will win your case for you.","You do not examine legislation in the light of the benefits it will convey if properly administered, but in the light of the wrongs it would do and the harms it would cause if improperly administered.","Doing what's right isn't the problem. It is knowing what's right.","We have entered an age in which education is not just a luxury permitting some men an advantage over others. It has become a necessity without which a person is defenseless in this complex, industrialized society. We have truly entered the century of the educated man.","I once told Nixon that the Presidency is like being a jackass caught in a hail storm. You've got to just stand there and take it.","John F. Kennedy was the victim of the hate that was a part of our country. It is a disease that occupies the minds of the few but brings danger to the many.","Poverty must not be a bar to learning and learning must offer an escape from poverty.","A man can take a little bourbon without getting drunk, but if you hold his mouth open and pour in a quart, he's going to get sick on it.","I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling rejected by the American people. I'm tired of waking up in the middle of the night worrying about the war.","Being president is like being a jackass in a hailstorm. There's nothing to do but to stand there and take it.","I'd rather give my life than be afraid to give it.","I have learned that only two things are necessary to keep one's wife happy. First, let her think she's having her own way. And second, let her have it.","Freedom is not enough.","The fact that a man is a newspaper reporter is evidence of some flaw of character.","There is but one way for a president to deal with Congress, and that is continuously, incessantly, and without interruption. If it is really going to work, the relationship has got to be almost incestuous.","I am making a collection of the things my opponents have found me to be and, when this election is over, I am going to open a museum and put them on display.","I am a freeman, an American, a United States Senator, and a Democrat, in that order.","No member of our generation who wasn't a Communist or a dropout in the thirties is worth a damn.","I am concerned about the whole man. I am concerned about what the people, using their government as an instrument and a tool, can do toward building the whole man, which will mean a better society and a better world.","This administration here and now declares unconditional war on poverty.","To conclude that women are unfitted to the task of our historic society seems to me the equivalent of closing male eyes to female facts.","I report to you that our country is challenged at home and abroad: that it is our will that is being tried and not our strength; our sense of purpose and not our ability to achieve a better America.","I feel like I just grabbed a big juicy worm with a right sharp hook in the middle of it.","Whether we are New Dealer, Old Dealer, Liberty Leaguer or Red, whether we agree or not, we still have the right to think and speak how we feel.","You might say that Lyndon Johnson is a cross between a Baptist preacher and a cowboy.","This is not Johnson's war. This is America's war. If I drop dead tomorrow, this war will still be with you.","Just like the Alamo, somebody damn well needed to go to their aid. Well, by God, I'm going to Viet Nam's aid!","Our most tragic error may have been our inability to establish a rapport and a confidence with the press and television with the communication media. I don't think the press has understood me.","There are no favorites in my office. I treat them all with the same general inconsideration.","There are plenty of recommendations on how to get out of trouble cheaply and fast. Most of them come down to this: Deny your responsibility.","The moon and other celestial bodies should be free for exploration and use by all countries. No country should be permitted to advance a claim of sovereignty.","If the American people don't love me, their descendants will.","They call upon us to supply American boys to do the job that Asian boys should do.","Our numbers have increased in Vietnam because the aggression of others has increased in Vietnam. There is not, and there will not be, a mindless escalation.","In our home there was always prayer - aloud, proud and unapologetic.","The separation of church and state is a source of strength, but the conscience of our nation does not call for separation between men of state and faith in the Supreme Being.","Presidents quickly realize that while a single act might destroy the world they live in, no one single decision can make life suddenly better or can turn history around for the good.","I will do my best. That is all I can do. I ask for your help - and God's.","Our society is illuminated by the spiritual insights of the Hebrew prophets. America and Israel have a common love of human freedom, and they have a common faith in a democratic way of life.","It is the genius of our Constitution that under its shelter of enduring institutions and rooted principles there is ample room for the rich fertility of American political invention.","The Russians feared Ike. They didn't fear me.","I don't believe I'll ever get credit for anything I do in foreign affairs, no matter how successful it is, because I didn't go to Harvard.","The CIA is made up of boys whose families sent them to Princeton but wouldn't let them into the family brokerage business.","When things haven't gone well for you, call in a secretary or a staff man and chew him out. You will sleep better and they will appreciate the attention.","It is always a strain when people are being killed. I don't think anybody has held this job who hasn't felt personally responsible for those being killed.","I believe the destiny of your generation - and your nation - is a rendezvous with excellence.","It may be, it just may be, that life as we know it with its humanity is more unique than many have thought.","This is a moment that I deeply wish my parents could have lived to share. My father would have enjoyed what you have so generously said of me-and my mother would have believed it.","You've got to work things out in the cloakroom, and when you've got them worked out, you can debate a little before you vote.","It is important that the United States remain a two-party system. I'm a fellow who likes small parties and the Republican Party can't be too small to suit me.","I seldom think of politics more than eighteen hours a day.","If two men agree on everything, you may be sure that one of them is doing the thinking.","Only two things are necessary to keep one's wife happy. One is to let her think she is having her own way, and the other is to let her have it.","I'm the only president you've got.","I want to make a policy statement. I am unabashedly in favor of women.","Jack was out kissing babies while I was out passing bills. Someone had to tend the store.","While you're saving your face, you're losing your ass.","One lesson you better learn if you want to be in politics is that you never go out on a golf course and beat the President.","Every President wants to do right.","Whoever won't fight when the President calls him, deserves to be kicked back in his hole and kept there.","We are not about to send American boys 9 or 10 thousand miles away from home to do what Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves."],"Lyndsy Fonseca":["Pilates is my favorite meditative way to get in shape. I don't like the gym and I don't like running, so I just lay on my Pilates reformer. It's great.","Comic-Con is overwhelming when you have such a long day of press schedules.","Women tend to take care of men a lot, but I like a guy who balances that out and takes care of me, too.","Guys need to know when to take charge.","The best relationships are when you both want to make each other happy - you buy the groceries, I do the dishes.","When a man leaves you notes saying he loves you, or asks how your day was - and then listens - you feel special.","I wanted to be a dancer my whole life. And when I gave it up to act, I always had a really sad part of myself that missed it and missed performing and missed being physical in that way.","Literally since I could walk... I was performing.","It's really hard to meet good women in Hollywood.","I think it's very rare that you see girl friendships on television. It's always cattiness and all that drama.","I love 'Breaking Bad.' I think that's my favorite show.","When I was a dancer, I felt this great sense of knowing my body and being in my body, and I think it's really easy as women to lose that and not really be one and loving it.","I'm very bubbly, so when people meet me, they sometimes think I'm fake. I'm excited to meet new people, but I guess I sound like I'm being sarcastic.","I love 'Halloween,' and I love 'The Thing.'","I would really love to do the score for movies. Pick the music and work with composers. I don't know if I'd be any good at it, but I love music.","Oh God, I would love to do Broadway, but I'm unfortunately not a very good singer.","I am the worst cook. I make a mess making a bowl of cereal... like, I'm just such a klutz in the kitchen.","My biggest lesson in becoming a woman is to really love what I've been given."],"Lynn Abbey":["A good short-story writer has an instinct for sketching in just enough background to ground the specific story.","There is nothing that compares to an unexpected round of applause.","I'm always trolling for trivia.","Ideas aren't magical; the only tricky part is holding on to one long enough to get it written down.","When I'm not writing or tweaking my computer, I do embroidery. When I'm not plunging into the past, tweaking, or embroidering, I'm reading books about history, computers, or embroidery.","I'm a writer first and an editor second... or maybe third or even fourth. Successful editing requires a very specific set of skills, and I don't claim to have all of them at my command.","I'm dense when it comes to discouragement.","I'm one of those writers who, when writing, believes she's god-and that she hasn't bestowed free will on any of her characters. In that sense there are no surprises in any of my books.","During the many centuries that magic, here on this planet, was presumed to have worked, there were at least as many theories as to how magic worked as there were cultures and religions.","I think my prose reads as if English were my second language. By the time I get to the end of a paragraph, I'm dodging bullets and gasping for breath.","That bedrock faith that I could write was what blinded me to attempts to discourage me.","It took me about 12 years to reach my million-word mark. The challenge now is to continue to challenge myself.","It's possible to become so comfortable with one's style and structure that one ceases to grow.","I do have a small collection of traditional SF ideas which I've never been able to sell. I'm known as a fantasy writer and neither my agent nor my editors want to risk my brand by jumping genre.","I'm not constrained by being a genre writer. Any story I can imagine, I can cast as a fantasy novel and probably get it published.","No one uses a ribbon typewriter any more, but your final draft is not the time to try to wring a few more sheets out of your inkjet cartridge.","Editors of open anthologies actively seek submissions from all comers, established and unknown. They are willing to read whatever the tide washes up at their feet.","The money can be decent, but I really don't recommend the work-for-hire route as an entry into publishing. Too many things can go wrong.","One of my great passions is the collection of historical trivia.","My writing has to support more than my research habit, but I love to curl up with a book about some dusty corner of history.","If you write, one of the questions you're always trying to answer is, Where do you get your ideas? And, if you write, you know how pointless a question this is and how difficult it is to answer.","Neophyte writers tend to believe that there is something magical about ideas and that if they can just get a hold of a good one, then their futures are ensured.","When I have an idea, it goes from vague, cloudy notion to 100,000 words in a heartbeat.","For me, writing a short story is much, much harder than writing a novel.","Short-story writing requires an exquisite sense of balance. Novelists, frankly, can get away with more. A novel can have a dull spot or two, because the reader has made a different commitment.","I've read short stories that are as dense as a 19th century novel and novels that really are short stories filled with a lot of helium.","I write sets of books, but I've also written a lot of orphans.","Once you've invested hundreds of hours in creating a coherent universe, your story's grown to around a half-million words and can't be written as anything less than a trilogy.","It's been a long time since I've written old-fashioned sword and sorcery; I'm hoping it's like riding a bicycle."],"Lynn Anderson":["I've been so blessed in my life that things have kind of seemed to fall in place for me. I just have to keep on the right path and not jaunt off to the left or the right.","I've got guys in my band that have been there for about 35 years. They're great players, and we still enjoy doing the music.","I don't play music very well, so I've always surrounded myself with people who played a lot better than I did. I'm a loyal person, and I just tend to leave it to the experts."],"Lynn Barber":["I have freedom. But freedom means total selfishness. It means nobody cares much what you do.","The best interviews like the best biographies should sing the strangeness and variety of the human race.","I just think I'm fairly aggressive."],"Lynn Coady":["Let's not confuse traditional behaviours with good manners. The definition of etiquette is gender neutral - it simply means we strive at all times to ensure a person in our company feels at ease.","True adulthood occurs the moment we grasp that the people who raised us do not exist solely for our comfort and reassurance. From that point on, the steady stream of unconditional love and support we've expected from them all our lives has to flow both ways.","Occasionally, chewing over some random letter writer's dilemma, I'll find myself imagining scenarios where the problem could be sidestepped by an innocent fib or series of evasive manoeuvres. Then, I slap myself on the wrist.","We live in a society that celebrates familial connection above any other kind of relationship. We are shown photos of our great-grandparents and encouraged to marvel over facial similarities. We are told to take pride in our bloodlines, celebrate our ancestry.","You don't need to have Asperger's to feel bewildered in a culture that relies so heavily on inconsequential chit-chat to grease the wheels of day-to-day life.","Flowers are an easy, eloquent expression of love at a time when words can seem clumsy and inadequate.","Loneliness sucks. It's a slog. It feels wonderful and exhilarating when someone makes it go away. But love is a whole different ball game.","Something I've always written about is social expectations: that the eyes of the community are on you all the time, expecting you to line up with certain social norms, certain behaviours. Whenever you forgot about them, they'd be strongly reiterated to you, in no uncertain terms.","Now, as a writer, the whole world is your nail polish display, and what's more, you can help yourself. A thrilling, colourful array of gorgeous human peculiarity revolves before your eyes, and you still can't quite believe it's all yours for the taking.","I've never understood people who treat their loved ones worse and with less respect than they would a total stranger or minor acquaintance.","No one expects the doormat to stand upright, shake itself off, and amble down the street to seek its own happiness.","However long, it's definitely the presence of other people that brings out the weirdness - that collision of your own way of being with the everyday lives of others, the abrupt awareness - always a surprise no matter how often it's happened - that their lives are very different from your own.","One does not become an atheist out of a desire for hassle-free Sunday mornings. People come to atheism because they have a problem with organized religion - usually a problem they consider to be of moral urgency.","I'm no atheist - I'm lazy. I really do like hassle-free Sunday mornings. I have a problem with organized religion, so I've simply opted out. Live and let live, I figure.","It's doubtful that any fiction worth reading has been produced on a computer running Windows Vista.","I guess you could say I'm 'kind' to my past books in the way you might be kind to an old boyfriend you still quite like and bear no grudge against but with whom have absolutely no interest in getting back together.","Somewhere in our cultural subconscious, we crave these figures that are big and strong and unassailable, like masculine fortresses. It's like how the 9/11 firemen were venerated.","Here's the thing about lingerie: The only time we see it outside our own bedrooms, it is on women who are gloriously freakish in their physical perfection.","The masterstroke of male fraternity, I believed, was the practice of never speaking of anything remotely personal or related to one's emotions. That way, no one is ever made uncomfortable. Any such awkward moments can always be dispelled with a flurry of pretend-punches.","I would just randomly blurt out things like, 'What if a man showed up today and was carrying an umbrella, but it wasn't raining?' Eventually, people started to call me weird.","When a man tells a woman there is no chance of a formal, committed, long-term relationship, the only self-respecting response is to take him at his word and move on.","I don't even like to cry in private.","It makes me proud not just to be a Canadian writer but to be a Canadian, to live in a country where we treat our writers like movie stars.","Most don't live inside their heads as a writer does, having conversations with her own ideas.","That's what fascinates me about these writers' retreats: You're in these small spaces with small groups of people, and all of the sudden, the spotlight is shining on you harder than it normally is.","I'm trying to get at something a little transcendent between humans. But at the same time, there's all that baggage: What's beautiful about humans is what's balanced by what's kind of ugly and petty and depressing.","I really do think of it in moral terms. I think that we can't kid ourselves that the storytelling impulse is innocent and does nothing but bring good to the world.","Guys know how to read each other's signals. They know how to telegraph love for one another without throwing their arms around one another.","I would never have thought my collection of short stories would win the Giller.","I know what the Giller nominee effect is, but we'll see what the next level is.","We are all somebody's children, and when we're in pain, we regress, instinctively looking to our parents to make everything better.","Anger is one of those emotions that doesn't follow the letter of the law. It speaks before it thinks. It rears up on its hind legs and charges.","When you're not sure your anger is justified, the thing to do is ask yourself exactly where it's coming from.","It's a moral absolute: If you are going to make a human being, you have a fundamental responsibility to that person - to honestly disclose exactly who they are and where they come from.","You can't hint a man into bestowing the ideal gift that displays all the love, appreciation and understanding you feel is lacking the rest of year.","Atheism is a moral position - a rather rigid one, if you've ever read the opinions of its highest-profile espousers, Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins.","A dominant misconception among believers is that their atheist brethren are a slavering pack of hell-bound debauchees, gleefully wining and wenching their way through life while loudly professing their amorality.","No matter how committed a marriage, there will always be other people - those we have chemistry with and those we don't, those we are attracted to, and those who shop for functional outdoors wear. The sooner a couple can accept the existence of the former and exchange a few basic reassurances concerning them, the easier life gets.","In the late sixties, when revolution and upheaval were everywhere, feminists were ridiculed for focusing on housework.","While Person A might believe the kitchen counter provides a reasonable surface on which to place one's balled-up sweatsocks post-gym, Person B - about to cut up some vegetables on that same counter, perhaps for a meal intended to be shared with Person A - can only read the sockball as a message that says, 'Hi! I have contempt for you!'","The thing about relationships is, the stronger they get, the more rapidly the realm of romance starts to overlap with the domestic.","I spent so many years in terror of 'making it legal' because the expression rang all too true - the wedding ritual struck me as nothing but a flowery front for the fulfilment of countless, tedious contracts and obligations.","One day it hit me: Truest friends, God bless their hearts, could not care less. They love you, they're pleased you're getting married and, ultimately, they don't give a fig how you get it done.","You know the actor's nightmare is getting up onstage and not being prepared? I think the writer's nightmare is giving a reading and somebody standing up and saying, 'That's not your story.'","This is not necessarily the answer people want, but ultimately, I think writing is an amoral process. Your ultimate responsibility is to the truth of the story you're trying to tell.","The process of writing a story isn't about fair. It's about getting to the heart of your story, getting to the truth of it. It transcends ideals of fair and unfair, right and wrong.","It's the typical mid-life crisis kind of thing, where you just stop and wonder, 'Should I go back to university and get a law degree?' I kind of looked around me and thought, 'What kind of idiot am I that I've just spent the last 10 years writing novels? Financially, I'm pretty much where I was when I was 28.'","Considerations of plot do a great deal of heavy lifting when it comes to long-form narrative - readers will overlook the most ham-fisted prose if only a writer can make them long to know what happens next.","As a novelist, you have to pick your battles. You are tired. You have begun to experience the first ominous tinglings of carpal tunnel syndrome. You wake up in the middle of the night with both hands lying across your chest like a couple of plucked bird carcasses, dead of all sensation.","Readers who claim a preference for short-form over long often tell me it's because they don't have time to commit to a book-length chunk of writing.","Literary readings aren't going to shake their reputation as the added-fibre of our entertainment diet until the people who organize and participate in them snap out of this mentality.","Audience participation can often inject a dose of adrenalin into your average dial-tone literary reading, especially if a handful of audience-members are mentally unhinged, and let's face it - you can always depend on at least one crackpot at these things.","Do not make the writer stand behind a podium. Anything but. A podium reeks of the lecture hall. A music stand, on the other hand, is nicely minimal and lends the writer - who usually needs all the help s/he can get - a musician's second-hand cool-factor.","A bunch of chairs lined up in front of a podium equals school.","I've always been a sucker for any technology engineered primarily for the entertainment of the human race - even such technology as has been disguised as 'useful' or 'improving' when we all know the real virtue lies in its ability to distract and divert.","The novel, as a genre, was once considered a diversion every bit as frivolous as Facebook, but over the years, we've managed to convince ourselves that reading fiction is as important to our mental digestion as fresh fruits and vegetables are to the processes that take place a little further down.","Here it is, 2011, and I feel zero shame when I tell you I would like to marry my smartphone. It is a handful of pure delight.","It's kind of sad, the way we've turned the entertainment of reading into a kind of psychic broccoli - something to feel guilty about if you don't force it on your face-making children while dutifully consuming a few token florets yourself.","A novelist's sense that he or she is 'above' a certain genre mainly comes out of the notion that the genre is somehow a debased version of his or her preferred form.","You can't really go into TV thinking, 'Maybe I can make a few bucks doing this thing I'm only kind of interested in to support my one true love, which is prose fiction.' I think you have to love what you're doing to do it well.","The fundamentals for me are character and conflict. I put character first because readers will be indifferent to conflict if they are indifferent to the character who is experiencing it.","We like long-form narrative journalism, and we feel there aren't enough high-profile outlets in Canada running the kind of stories we want to showcase - long, meaty, thoughtful, investigative.","We thought we'd name the magazine for the number of bridges within Edmonton's city limits. We thought this number was 18. Much later, we learned that the number is actually 21. But we didn't like the sound of that so much.","I started out in the journalism program, but I got kicked out. I wasn't very good at it. It wasn't where I wanted to be ultimately.","I come from a working-class background, and I thought I had to be studying something that would get me a job.","I think authors like me are always struggling with the idea that they should have a brand and a Facebook author page and they should get Twitter accounts. I don't know what to do with them.","I decided a long time ago to be myself and not worry too much about cultivating some kind of personality that didn't feel natural or true to who I am.","Keep a copy of 'Islands in the Stream' by Ernest Hemingway on the left hand side of your desk. Keep Fitzgerald's 'The Crack Up' on the right. When you get stuck, pick them up and pretend that they are having a fight, like you used to do with your GI Joes.","When revising, consider whether you have written anything that will hurt or offend a member of your immediate family. If the answer is no, go back and add something.","Never use dogs to symbolize anything. That is ridiculous. Always ensure that any dogs are just dogs; i.e., characters in the story who happen to be dogs.","I think, as writers, our first responsibility is to writing an honest story. Tell the story you want to tell, without pulling your punches.","My dad was a real man's man, and so were my brothers, in a small town where hockey is king. It's a masculine culture. It made me really attentive to what it meant to be a guy.","I even felt like I liked guys better than women - that men were relevant and women weren't. It took me a while to realize I'd been socialized to have a slighting view of my own gender.","I still find the idea of a research-heavy or historical novel daunting. That's something I've had in mind for a while: like, would you research for a year and then start writing? I sit down, and I just don't know how to write it.","When writing sex scenes, there is often no pleasing anyone, except perhaps the writer herself.","I avoid writing about sex out of a certainty that no matter how grown up and matter-of-fact I might try to be, there is a snickering yet nun-terrorized 12-year-old-boy inside me who would at some point be certain to grab the reins in his hairy palms.","The creative process taps into our deepest subconscious, and we are each of us sex-crazed - products of a shame-based Judeo-Christian culture that has irrevocably warped us all to varying degrees.","What I've learned is that you get better at writing by writing, and that 'youthful energy' will only get you so far."],"Lynn Cohen":["Not all stories translate well when read out loud.","You learn to act by acting. You only get so much from acting class. You have to put your act on stage.","You can have a five-page speech, and if the camera's not looking at you, you're not there."],"Lynn Collins":["I've studied astrology for many, many years, and I feel like it's an incredibly challenging art.","From the beginning of time, we've told stories, Shamans and Medicine People, and not to be pompous about it, but I feel like that is the lineage I take down and where I come from. There is magic to storytelling.","I think Andrew Stanton is such an amazing, creative mind.","I went to Julliard where they use a lot of voice and speech exercises.","I can't really connect with things unless they are spiritual in nature, so I have to make acting spiritual for myself, and each role a spiritual journey for me.","I started doing karate at four, my parents were karatekas. I stopped when I was 17 and went to Julliard and had a lot of stage combat there.","The way that I work is very specific, very thorough, and the process has to be totally clear.","I'm Irish and Cherokee Indian. I can't faint.","I'm a trained martial artist. My parents were both martial artists.","Every role that you accept makes you grow in some way. It's part of the creative process.","The truth for me is that I've been doing independent film since the get-go, so that's a big passion of mine, but the big ones are really fun, too. I like my world to be eclectic.","I feel like part of your job as an actor is you're going to get noticed, and the more successful you get, the more noticed you are. It's kind of like a Catch-22.","In my career, I've really wanted to sort of be a morpher and not show my own identity.","What I do is very spiritual to me. I can't really connect with things unless they are spiritual in nature, so I have to make acting spiritual for myself, and each role a spiritual journey for me.","They're really competitive at drama in Texas.","I will say that Lynda Carter is an awesome woman.","I went to a private school in Singapore and they had an incredible arts program. Every day I was doing something artistic.","My family are very, very religious in Texas. They're Southern Baptists. I left to go to New York when I was 17 and I realised I wasn't Southern Baptist. That's not how I am inclined."],"Lynn Davies":["There's so much hard work, dedication, and focus goes in from not just the athletes but from the coaches, officials, governing bodies, and Sport Wales. It's a real team effort, and it's rightly called Team Wales.","It's perseverance that's the key. It's persevering for long enough to achieve your potential.","You've got to be actively involved in the process yourself and you've got to listen carefully to what the coach is saying, take that on board yourself and implement what the coach is saying.","There are a lot of kids coming in to athletics, but there is also a big drop-out rate. We've got it right at the top end, but we have to maintain the base of the pyramid.","There are hurdles to overcome in sport and in life. Sport is a very valuable learning ground for how to live your life in the best possible way.","As a youngster, I enjoyed sport and my ambition was to be a great sportsman.","I think a four-year ban would effectively rule out one Olympic games - a life ban is too harsh. I think everyone deserves a second chance. If you come back from missing one Olympic games and serving a four-year ban, you are a pretty determined and reformed character.","I still do cardiovascular exercises, aerobic exercises, and then strength training, as it's important to keep your muscle strength, as every decade you lose about 10% of this.","One of the top political issues of the day is how to combat young people not being active anymore.","It is almost impossible to divorce sport from politics, but sport is such a positive factor in today's society - there is nothing else which will bring so many people together in that atmosphere.","U.K. Athletics needs to develop a financial independence so it no longer has to be subject to the whim of politicians. If you are reliant on government, there is a big problem.","If you have a coach helping you, developing your skills alongside you, that's when you're on your way to becoming not just a participant but achieving.","I saw what politics did to the Olympic Games in 1980 and 1984, and I would defend the right of a sportsman to go and play and perform where they want.","It's about lessons for life. It's not just about winning either.","Sport and life is about losing. It's about understanding how to lose.","You've got to be a disciplined person if you want to succeed both in sport and in life.","It's not just about a coach telling you what to do and just following it unthinkingly.","It's about somebody initially knowing more about it than you do but eventually you learn a lot about it yourself and practise the skills and techniques that you've been taught.","The IOC are the guardians of the Olympic ideal.","The reception and the welcome home was quite overwhelming but an indication of how much the Welsh people valued my winning in the Olympics - it was a great memory.","My sporting heroes were Ken Jones, Stanley Matthews, and Cliff Morgan.","If athletes are found to have taken performance enhancing drugs, then they should be banned for two years, even if they are British.","Dai Greene will be our greatest-ever Welsh athlete.","To win an Olympic title when there are 205 nations taking part, you have to be super-human. You have to be superman.","I am a sportsman, and I hate politics.","The Cardiff Half Marathon has already proved itself to be one of the biggest and best road races in the U.K., and when the best athletes in the world run on the same course, the times should be spectacular. But the real beauty of this event is that ordinary runners get the chance to line up on the same start line as the best athletes in the world.","One of our targets as a country is to now work very closely with the Commonwealth countries - they could become a very big market for us.","It's not a bad idea to have gossip and talking points in athletics.","We're focusing on producing top, great athletes for the Olympics.","I've been involved in sport right through my life.","Belief is such an important aspect of sport.","Long jumping sounds simple - you run fast and jump well. But it is about getting all the technical bits right.","I believe the friendship of the Games still exists. There is a tremendous camaraderie and atmosphere at the Olympic and Commonwealth Games - where else could you go and sit down and have breakfast with a Russian weightlifter, an East German sprinter, and an Indian fencer and talk about different cultures and problems?","I am delighted that Jason Gardener will be taking over from me as President of U.K. Athletics. With his competitive background in the sport as an Olympic champion coupled with his engaging personality and his experience as a board member of U.K. Athletics, he possesses all the qualities required to be a successful president.","Athletes peak for the Olympic Games and can take months to get back up to that level.","Success in sport is based on you thinking you are doing something to gain that edge, but if I wanted that little bit extra, I would go and run up sand dunes at Merthyr Mawr.","I played rugby in the winter, cricket in the summer, and for a brief period was on the books at Cardiff City. Athletics was only sports day for me. In fact, I never really liked it. I was never too keen on a sport that didn't have a ball at your feet.","It's important for me that I stay in shape, although each year it gets a little harder.","I remember one of my first international trips to Poland. After a long, tortuous journey, we arrived at the hotel exhausted but without the team management, who had gone ahead of us from the airport in cars, checked into the best rooms, and left us with what was left.","I had jumped about 6.40 metres with no training, no run-up, and certainly no skill, when this big, good-looking guy came up to me and told me I could be great.","You can exercise right through to your 60s, 70s, 80s and even 90s.","You can be even fitter at 60 than you were at 20.","People need to have clear goals about why they are exercising, and they should consult a fitness expert to find out what kind of exercise is suitable.","We have to harness the Olympic experience and this inspiration young people have to get into sport.","People like Ellie Simmonds, David Weir, and Hannah Cockroft have become superstars alongside the likes of Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis. I think it has changed attitudes to disability.","We must have PE teachers and coaches who are well trained and qualified.","The important thing for the future is that our schools and clubs have more and better coaches and teachers to ensure that all that enthusiasm, spirit and talent is harnessed and developed.","When you win an Olympic gold, it is such a powerful feeling that stays with you for the rest of your life.","I felt I was never going to beat Igor Ter-Ovanesyan or Ralph Boston because they were the joint world record holders.","It was not about the guy who could jump the furthest; it was about the guy who could jump the furthest on that particular day in the worst conditions of any Olympic long jump final.","When you win, suddenly this celebrity status is hoisted upon you."],"Lynn Flewelling":["It would be lovely if it was all Right vs. Wrong, Good overcomes Evil - I think most Americans, going about their daily lives, fool themselves into thinking that that's how our little world works, but it just isn't so.","The move to creating stories was a natural progression for me, but the most pivotal time was probably in 6th grade: That year, a friend introduced me to the stories of Ray Bradbury, and a student teacher introduced me to creative writing.","When I started writing 'Luck in the Shadows,' I just wanted to create an adventure story.","I think the key is to give the reader characters they not only care about, but identify with, and to never take away all hope.","I was always a 'let's pretend' kind of kid.","I come from a very small city in a rather remote part of America, where writers simply weren't part of the daily fabric.","I love all of my books. They were labors of love; I was striving to create something well done, and I do feel I succeeded.","Realism isn't something most people associate with the fantasy genre, yet it's an essential element of great fantasy writing.","Setting is the bedrock of your story. If you choose a real-world backdrop, be certain you get your facts straight.","The real world is the fantasy writer's scrapbook. Real history, real geography, real customs and religions are all invaluable sources of guidance and inspiration.","If you set your story in Rome, Ireland or Sheboygan, for that matter, go there. If you're broke, set it in the town where you live, or where you grew up."],"Lynn Fontanne":["One reason we lasted so long is that we usually played two people who were very much in love. As we were realistic actors, we became those two people. So we had a divertissement: I had an affair with him, and he with me.","I lied to everybody. I lie very well, being an actress, naturally.","We can be bought, but we can't be bored."],"Lynn Good":["If you keep an open mind, you can learn so much from the people around you.","Leadership is a journey - you never arrive.","I actually had someone say to me, 'Lynn, you're going to have very good days, and you're going to have very bad days. But It's rare that things are as good as they look, and it's rare that things are as bad as they seem.' So having perspective, and challenging perspective, is important to making good decisions.","Effectiveness comes from those qualitative things that give you the ability to network, communicate, and lead people toward an outcome they can't see.","2013 was a year of great accomplishment for Duke: our first full year as a combined company.","There's nothing about Lynn Good at age 30 or age 35 that would have said, 'I am setting my sights on being a CEO.'","I find, at times, people underestimate me. That's really an asset.","Our highest priorities are safe operations and the well-being of the people and communities we serve.","There is growing demand for renewable energy.","The regulations keep on coming. And we are trying to make decisions that we will be happy with for decades.","Through Duke Energy's strong balance sheet and electric generation expertise, and Piedmont's understanding of natural gas markets and proficient operations, the combined company will be well-positioned for a future that may require additional natural gas infrastructure and services to meet the needs of our customers.","Leaders play a unique role in periods of crisis and chaos. Because if you don't, you're not going to harness the power of all the people behind you.","If you can, anticipate that life is going to be full of detours.","We support regional generation, particularly for nuclear. It's just a large investment. We think it's something a community comes around to make those investments work, and South Carolina is very committed to nuclear generation.","I think we'll still be operating coal in 2030. Whether we will be in 2040, I think, is a question, or in 2050.","On two occasions, utility executives I'd never met had looked at me and said, 'I thought you'd be bigger!' In a way, I took that as a compliment!","You see more women in the CFO ranks. It's an evolution.","Always play to your strengths, whether your strengths are gender-based or just natural aptitude.","You're well-spoken, or you're very analytical, or you're a great team-builder, or you're great with relationships... Playing to your strengths is always something good to build on because you're trying to develop a foundation to keep growing, as a professional and as a leader.","I went to work in accounting at Arthur Andersen. At one point, it was the creme de la creme. I wanted to work there because it looked like the hardest thing I could find, and I loved being on a steep learning curve. I progressed quickly, and two years out of college, I was managing a small team of people.","As you think about developing people through their careers, you're looking for that transition from being the smartest person in the room - and caring so much about that - to being the most effective.","People who love what they do get after it every day.","There weren't many women ahead of me.","Our nation's power plant fleet must include a mix of solar, wind, hydro, natural gas and nuclear plants.","I believe that nuclear needs to be a part of the solution if the U.S. really wants to be aggressive about reducing carbon.","When you're in a crisis, there's really no playbook.","It's important to keep your long term perspective and communicate well both externally and internally.","At a certain career level, it's no longer about whether you are the smartest subject-matter expert in the room.","We see natural gas as an important part of the electricity generation mix for many decades to come.","It was exciting putting hundreds of millions of dollars to work buying and building wind farms in Texas.","Utilities fall in love with their assets, and that's a danger we need to avoid.","Nuclear is an important part of the heritage of Duke. We operate the largest regulated nuclear fleet in the U.S. We love the diversity of the generation.","M&A is always an opportunistic tool to grow a company.","Fracking has been a real technological change that has caused great innovation in our business, and we've had the benefit of very low gas prices for our customers as a result of that.","If I were to share with you the number of attacks that come into the Duke network every day, you would be astounded. And it's not from people working out of their garage; it's from nation-states that are trying to penetrate systems.","An investor in Duke Energy is expecting a dividend payment. That's roughly 70 to 75 percent of the earnings I produce. The business that goes with that level of dividend is a business that has more predictability, more stability.","I get energized around a plan - what's it going to be like in three months? Six months? You're not going to let it defeat you. You got to keep going.","If you feel like there is going to be an emotional reaction that won't be helpful to resolve the situation, anger or other things, disarm the situation in some way, and you can use different techniques to do that.","The way we grow is, we make investments. We've been building a natural-gas platform within Duke that started with the pipelines.","As we look ahead, we see increasing opportunities for Duke in natural gas - not just for producing electricity, but in providing gas for our customers. We have been investing in renewables as well throughout the U.S.","The closing of ash basins is really part of decommissioning a coal plant.","I don't think of myself as a powerful woman.","I had never seen a computer when I went to college.","I think about trust and confidence as something that you earn every day, and we will keep at it, earning it every day.","My father was a World War II Marine who became a high school principal. He always had a heart for students who maybe were underprivileged or had difficulty of some sort.","When I was growing up, we had a widow living next door to us. So the habit was that if we went to the grocery store, we called her first. If we cut our yard, we cut her yard, no questions asked.","I can be incredibly focused, and I can appear impatient. So I've learned to slow down, get to know people, and provide more context. There's nothing wrong with getting to the point pretty quickly, but it's also helpful to give people an opportunity to talk about their work.","We are accountable for what happened at Dan River and have learned from this event.","We are setting a new standard for coal ash management and implementing smart, sustainable solutions for all of our ash basins.","For 2015, Duke Energy's employees safety record received the top rank among large utilities as recognize by EEI.","I become the face of the company, and that's a responsibility.","I don't see a sea change by 2020, but I see migration in the direction of modernization and more flexibility in the generating system going forward.","I don't believe you can absolutely have it all.","I hope nuclear becomes a part of the conversation, at the right time when we recognize the importance of that resource. I hope we can work that out as a country and figure out how we are going to put nuclear in the mix.","Anytime we make additional investment in a coal plant, we are really challenging whether that investment is economic.","Over the long term, we should develop and implement new technologies to capture and store coal's carbon emissions. We also must make our electric grid more resilient.","All options to produce, transmit, and store electricity should be considered, driven by clear price signals and constructive government policy.","Reliable and competitively priced electricity is fundamental to growing our economy and creating jobs. Our customers expect nothing less.","We don't believe carbon capture is a proven, scalable, commercially available technology.","I don't see any new coal.","There are no coal plants on the drawing board for Duke, which leaves us with gas, renewables, and nuclear.","If we just isolate distributed solar all by itself, it does not work without the utility around it. And so the utility needs to be paid for the services it provides.","You move an organization when they understand where you want them to go.","The enthusiasm around carbon capture and sequestration was probably greater before the shale-gas discovery and the low prices were so prevalent.","Natural gas is an important part of delivering energy, whether you're producing power or other solutions for customers.","I am honored to be named chairman of Duke Energy's board and privileged to lead our company forward for our customers, employees, and shareholders.","I am deeply honored by the trust the board has placed in me to lead Duke Energy. I have a high degree of confidence in the strength of our company's leadership and dedicated employees.","I will work to ensure Duke Energy is positioned to continue its track record of outstanding customer service and operational and financial excellence.","Our customers are at the center of everything we do.","More than 40 percent of the electricity we generated in the Carolinas in 2015 was from carbon-free sources.","As we continue to move to a lower-carbon future, we will also continue to work constructively with states to identify customer solutions that preserve the reliability and affordability that our communities expect.","Volatility is not something that is a great fit for Duke if you look at the level of dividend we pay.","Building new nuclear is something that is going to take a lot of commitment, not only from our company but from the communities we serve. It is a five-to-seven-year journey to build one, and they are expensive.","What we are investing in, from a generation standpoint, are renewables and natural gas.","I love nuclear.","If we're going to be serious about decarbonizing the bulk-power system, nuclear has to be part of the conversation.","I respect passionate views.","I'll be the first one to tell you I burn coal... That fossil generation and the nuclear generation, frankly, is necessary in order for me to provide power.","You were in the midst of a chaotic, unfair, didn't-know-how-it-was-going-to-end story, and the only thing you could do was... keep moving.","When you are in a situation or a crisis, you need to define, what is the unique role that I can play?","If we are not more efficient, we put ourselves in a position where prices need to rise or profits deteriorate in a way that makes us less attractive to investors.","We should be building more nuclear today."],"Lynn Johnston":["And my father was a comic. He could play any musical instrument. He loved to perform. He was a wonderfully comedic character. He had the ability to dance and sing and charm and analyze poetry.","You think about child abuse and you think of a father viciously attacking a daughter or a son, but in my family it was my mother. My mother, I would say, was a... very brutal disciplinarian.","Yes, and when I had Aaron, he left me, and I didn't know how to raise a child. And I wasn't close to my parents, and because I was too proud to go to my parents for help, I mistreated that little baby. I didn't want a baby.","If I was in love with someone, I would get their picture out of the school yearbook and do portraits. If I was curious about sex, I would draw pictures of it. There were no books for me to look at. Then I would go find my father's matches to burn the paper.","The most profound statements are often said in silence.","I loved the Little Lulu stories, where she would fantasize that her bedroom rug would turn into a pool of water, and she could dive down into the center of the world.","People never knew we were poor, but out of that poverty came the most incredible inventions - board games, recipes... we never stopped inventing.","Only a couple of times have I ever been to church and felt enlightened by it.","You see, anything I imagined, I could draw.","When Kate was born, she was born into a world of joy and happiness and confidence. The difference between the children is night and day. She's happy, she's thriving, she's full of self-confidence. I tell her she's beautiful every day before I send her off to school.","That's what my mother did. And my father was the first person she'd met who treated her kindly. She was terrified of men, and she married a very meek, kind, dear man. And she had the upper hand. She ruled the roost.","Sure, I've had some bad times, but everybody does. But people don't get to talk about them like I do, unless they do to a therapist. People don't get to put them in the paper like I do.","No matter how old you are, there's always something good to look forward to.","My mother was a very literate person who had educated herself. She had an exceptional vocabulary.","My brother was a great audience, and if he liked the picture, he would laugh and laugh and laugh, and he would want to keep the picture. Making people laugh with an image I had created... what power that was!","Mom and Dad would stay in bed on Sunday morning, but the kids would have to go to church.","It's taken me a long time to become the person I am, for all the ugliness to fall away. The rotten flesh is gone, and the seed is there. I can touch that now.","In a way, a certain amount of self-criticism is a good thing, because it keeps you humble. Realizing that no matter what success you've achieved, you can still make enemies makes you humble, too.","I've had some tremendous adventures, good and bad. It's part of the novel, and a novel isn't interesting if it doesn't have some good and bad. And you don't know what good is if bad hasn't been a part of your life.","I've always felt that life is a novel, and part of it is written for you, and part of it is written by you. It's up to you to write the ending, ultimately.","I was just so lucky to have a wonderful life after a tough marriage.","I often think you bring unhappiness on yourself, because if you don't like yourself very much, you allow yourself to be influenced by people who reinforce that.","I know it sounds crazy, but I have had far more connection with my parents after their deaths.","Complaining is good for you as long as you're not complaining to the person you're complaining about.","But I married a guy who treated me very badly, but I was happy. I was miserable, so I was happy.","But even though all this was going on at home, if someone had tried to take me away and put me in a children's home, I couldn't have handled it. Even though my mother was very brutal, it was my home.","After I got this job at the syndicate, I started sending them money so they could go on trips and do the things they could never afford to do. All the while, I never knew that my mother was socking money away.","Aaron and I will be joined at the hip until the day we die. We have loved and hated each other since the day he was born. He's very much a part of my heart. He's going to broadcasting college now, and he'll do fine. But he came into a world that did not welcome him."],"Lynn Jurich":["When wireless cellphones first came out, analysts predicted that at peak, it would only replace 5% of landlines. They said the quality wasn't good enough. Clearly that was improved. I think you'll find a similar thing in solar.","I think, in a lot of places, the solar panels are a badge of honor; they're trendy. If you go to Hawaii or Japan, people even install fake solar panels because it's cool and it's popular. And so I think solar panels have gotten a lot more attractive. They're sleek, black, they look good on a roof.","Homeowners want solar power. It's cost-effective. We invented a business model that makes it really easy for consumers to switch to solar - and that's solar-as-a-service.","Before solar, before Sunrun, if consumers wanted electricity, there was a monopoly of someone who told you how much it costs.","Thanks to the social web, we can share and trade to use a whole universe of things we once had to buy ourselves. From cars to solar panels, people are realizing they can reap the benefits of ownership without the expense and hassle of buying.","For me, not owning a car means I may spend a little extra time on public transportation, but I can use that time to read, catch up on work projects, and make the phone calls I couldn't get to earlier. Plus, I never waste time at the mechanics or gas station.","It's common for cultural shifts to start with young, urban adopters before going mainstream.","As we settle into 2013, I predict this: We'll see companies that promote this shift from private ownership thrive. More people will be able to access things they simply don't need to own, and they'll save money and live better, cleaner, green lives doing it.","Innovative companies have started to realize there are not enough 'green consumers' willing to pay more for something just because it's green.","There is a huge market for products and services aimed at what I like to call the Pocketbook Environmentalist: a shopper who's savvy enough to know things don't necessarily have to cost more just because they're good for the environment.","Since I work in home solar, I can't resist focusing on the amazing developments happening here. What many homeowners don't know is that they can have solar installed on their roofs without owning the panels or paying the high upfront costs.","Prior to SunRun, I was headed toward a career in venture capital and then realized I wanted to apply my knowledge of finance more directly to helping change the world.","We believe widespread adoption of home solar will significantly improve life in cities by phasing out polluting coal plants, eliminating miles of ugly new transmission lines, and ensuring cleaner, healthier lives.","With the right infrastructure in place, home solar will be recognized publicly as affordable, easy, and smart, and every new home built in the developed world can have clean energy sources built into it.","Rooftop solar is the first true form of competition that utilities have ever faced, and that is why they're attacking it.","Consumers used to think they had to compromise with solar. It was, 'Okay, I'm doing the right thing for the environment; it's cool to see the panels. I have to compromise on the cost and convenience side.' And now they no longer have to. On the cost side, it's cheaper, and on the convenience side, we set it all up.","I just am a clean air freak. I grew up in the woods. I worked in China for a bit and was exposed to all the resources being used and the pollution and felt strongly that for our generation, the biggest economic and societal problem is energy.","There is a new wave of environmental consumers I like to call Pocketbook Environmentalists. They're going green primarily because it makes good financial sense, but the fact that it benefits their families' health and the environment also makes them feel good.","With Zipcar, consumers avoid the upfront cost of buying a car, not to mention gas, insurance, and repairs. Plus, they reduce the number of polluting vehicles on the road. Suddenly the planet-smart carless option is also the convenient money-saving option.","For every family in liberal San Francisco that went solar with SunRun in 2010, nearly eight families in more conservative Fresno made the switch to our solar power service.","For Pocketbook Environmentalists, financial savings are the primary motivator. However Pocketbook Environmentalists are changing the face of the market and the planet for the better by demanding that going green saves you money.","We're leading a fundamental shift from centralized energy to distributed energy. Energy will go in that direction, just like mainframe computers went to client servers, then to the Internet. I believe in solar, and the macro trends are just too undeniable.","I was an investor doing well and decided to be an entrepreneur.","Since Sunrun introduced solar as a service in 2007, it has become the preferred way for consumers to go solar in the nation's top solar markets. Sunrun has deployed more than $2 billion in solar systems and has raised more than $300 million in equity capital.","I'm on the board of the Sierra Club Foundation and am myself a big environmentalist. But the way to make the biggest difference is to change mainstream behavior.","When Netscape failed, it didn't mean the Internet was over.","Our customer base isn't just people saying, 'I'm an environmentalist, I'm in my Birkenstocks, I went to Woodstock.' Solar is a bipartisan technology. Republicans like solar; conservatives like solar. Over 30% of our customers are veterans. There's something very American about being able to produce power on your own rooftop.","All people believe in America, jobs, creating energy here, not being dependent on foreign energy sources.","Hire people who are smarter than you, and don't be afraid to work with them as partners. Make it clear that you plan to learn from them, not just the other way around. The right, smart, motivated people respond very well to that approach, particularly coming from a younger manager like I am.","For a lot of people, one of the reasons they don't like to work for founders of startups is that they can be sensitive and protective around what they've built. You have an emotional attachment to the early marketing and technology materials, and you don't want to hear that anything's wrong with them.","On Sundays, I like to plan how I want to exit the week and what are the key things I need to get done that week. I list them, and then I do check-ins on them each morning.","You have to accept the fact that not all your decisions are going to be right - and when they are wrong, you have to own it right away. I try not to have an emotional connection or investment in the decisions I make so that when they need to change, I can quickly move on to: 'How do we fix this?'"],"Lynn Lavner":["The Bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals. That doesn't mean that God doesn't love heterosexuals. It's just that they need more supervision.","The church must be the critic and guide of the state, and never its tool."],"Lynn Margulis":["Everybody knows what a caterpillar is, and it doesn't look anything like a butterfly.","Life on earth is such a good story you cannot afford to miss the beginning... Beneath our superficial differences we are all of us walking communities of bacteria. The world shimmers, a pointillist landscape made of tiny living beings.","Body concentrates order. It continuously self-repairs. Every five days you get a new stomach lining. You get a new liver every two months. Your skin replaces itself every six weeks. Every year, 98 percent of the atoms of your body are replaced. This non-stop chemical replacement, metabolism, is a sure sign of life.","All of us from fertile egg to embryo to corpse, are exactly that: warm, wet, furry animals compelled by the sexuality of our forefathers and foremothers to be, either directly or indirectly, our own exciting and excitable, provocative and provocable selves.","Despite our very recent appearance on the planet, humanity combines arrogance with increasing material demands, even as we become more numerous. Our toughness is a delusion. Have we the intelligence and discipline to vigilantly guard against our tendency to grow without limit?","Natural selection eliminates and maybe maintains, but it doesn't create.","All I ask is that we compare human consciousness with spirochete ecology.","I was taught over and over again that the accumulation of random mutations led to evolutionary change - led to new species. I believed it until I looked for evidence.","My work more than didn't fit in. It crossed willy-nilly the boundaries that people had spent their lives building up. It hits some 30 subfields of biology, even geology.","Life on earth is more like a verb. It repairs, maintains, re-creates, and outdoes itself.","To romp along the connected rooftops and fire escapes of Chicago's second city of garages was my young life's passion.","All scientists agree that evolution has occurred - that all life comes from a common ancestry, that there has been extinction, and that new taxa, new biological groups, have arisen. The question is, is natural selection enough to explain evolution? Is it the driver of evolution?","All living beings, not just animals, but plants and microorganisms, perceive. To survive, an organic being must perceive - it must seek, or at least recognize, food and avoid environmental danger.","People think the earth is going to die and they have to save it. That's ridiculous. If you rid the earth of flowering plants, people would die, period. But the earth was without flowering plants for almost all of its history.","Although the detail of our sexual energies and their objects and objectives vastly vary, the existence of our sexuality itself is an undeniable truth.","If you really want to study evolution, you've got go outside sometime, because you'll see symbiosis everywhere!","Life learned early on to recognize itself.","The urgency to mate persists in all people as in all other mammals because of the evolutionary drive to continue the species, the inborn imperative for genes to reproduce and hormonal differences that evolved over millions of years.","The fewer species there are and the fewer species we know about, the fewer questions we even know to ask.","Of course, the plea for respect for nonhuman life goes far beyond the scientific delight of familiarity with our planet mates. The nonhuman forms of life with which we 6,000 million talking, upright apes share this finite planet are directly or indirectly connected to our well-being.","There is no scientific reason to think that we, even with space travel, are going to survive as a species for ever, certainly not by biting off the hand that feeds us, which is exactly what we are doing.","Politicians need a better understanding of global ecology. We need to be freed from our species-specific arrogance. No evidence exists that we are 'chosen', the unique species for which all the others were made. Nor are we the most important one because we are so numerous, powerful and dangerous.","People say I am against Darwin. That is ridiculous."],"Lynn Nottage":["I see procrastination and research as part of my artistic process.","I love my people's history. I feel a huge responsibility to tell the stories of my past and my ancestors' past.","I always thought of my mother as a warrior woman, and I became interested in pursuing stories of women who invent lives in order to survive.","Once working people discover that, collectively, we have more power than we do as individual silos, then we become an incredibly powerful force. But I think that there are powers that be that are invested in us remaining divided along racial lines, along economic lines.","The people sometimes who are closest to us are the ones who bear the brunt of our frustration.","Even in Congo, where conflicts are happening, people have births, weddings, deaths, and celebrations.","In the business of war, the role of women is really to maintain normalcy and ensure that there is cultural continuity.","When you begin a play, you're going to have to spend a lot of time with those characters, so those characters are going to have to be rich enough that you want to take a very long journey with them. That's how I begin thinking about what I want to write about and who I want to write about.","I am interested in people living in the margins of society, and I do have a mission to tell the stories of women of colour in particular. I feel we've been present throughout history, but our voices have been neglected.","The essence of creativity is to look beyond where you can actually see. I don't want to dwell in same place too long.","I can't quite remember the exact moment when I became obsessed with writing a play about the seemingly endless war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but I knew that I wanted to somehow tell the stories of the Congolese women caught in the cross-fire.","I was really interested in the way in which poverty and economic stagnation were transforming and corrupting the American narrative.","All of my plays are about people who have been marginalized... erased from the public record.","I think that human beings were incredibly resilient; otherwise, we wouldn't keep going.","Replace judgment with curiosity.","The stage is the last bastion of segregation.","I'm a schizophrenic writer.","I need a release from whatever I'm writing.","My interest in theatre and storytelling began in my mother's kitchen. It was a meeting place for my mother's large circle of friends.","Each play I write has its own unique origin story.","I find my characters and stories in many varied places; sometimes they pop out of newspaper articles, obscure historical texts, lively dinner party conversations and some even crawl out of the dusty remote recesses of my imagination.","If you lead with the anger, it will turn off the audience. And what I want is the audience to engage with the material and to listen and then to ask questions. I think that 'Ruined' was very successful at doing that.","I've been asked a lot why didn't 'Ruined' go to Broadway. It was the most successful play that Manhattan Theatre Club has ever had in that particular space, and yet we couldn't find a home on Broadway.","I was repeatedly told that there isn't an African American woman who can open a show on Broadway. I said, 'Well, how do we know? How do we know if we don't do it?' I said, 'I think you're wrong.'","African American women in particular have incredible buying power. Statistically, we go to the movies more than anyone. We have made Tyler Perry's career. His films open with $25 million almost consistently.","Plays are getting smaller and smaller, not because playwrights minds are shrinking but because of the economics.","I love Twitter.","I knew that there was a great deal of depth and life that was sitting just beyond my mother's gaze.","In many ways, I consider those to be my formative years, because when you're in school, you have a distant relationship to the world in that most of what you're learning is from books and lectures. But at Amnesty, I came face to face with realities in a very direct and harsh way.","There's never any ebb in human misery.","My hobby is raising my children.","By the time I reached 50, I'd accumulated many unresolved fears and desires.","Growing up in New York City, I'd flirted with the idea of driving, but between the subway and the sidewalks, I'd never needed to learn.","I am a Tony voter; it is an honor that I take seriously. Each season, I enter the process with a degree of enthusiasm and optimism, which dissipates as I slowly plow through show after show.","Broadway is a closed ecosystem.","If the Tony Awards want to remain relevant in the American theater conversation, then they need to embrace the true diversity of voices that populate the American theater.","A lot of the factories that had been the bedrock of many small cities were being shut down, which led me to investigate what I'm calling the 'de-industrial revolution.'","I teach at Columbia, and I'm always looking for books I can lose myself in during the 45 minutes I'm on the train.","I would like there to be gender equity. I would like the Broadway season to reflect sort of the demographic of the country.","Women are standing up and leaning forward and asserting their power.","I like to go into a space, listen, absorb, and then interpret.","When you're fighting for an increasingly smaller portion of the pie, you turn against each other; you create reasons to hate each other.","I think folks who are resistant to engaging in art become less so once they encounter art that really reflects them.","It's incumbent on us to reach beyond the confines of the institutions that traditionally produce art and find new ways to get it to the people.","It remains an incredible struggle for women in theater, and, in particular, playwrights and directors, to get their work seen and to not only get seen, but to get it to Broadway.","We use metaphors to express our own truths.","The presence of a bed changes the way people interact.","When I sat in rooms with middle-aged white men, I heard them speaking like young black men in America. They had been solidly middle class for the majority of their working careers, but now they were feeling angry, disaffected, and in some cases, they actually had tears in their eyes.","For me, playwriting is sharing my experiences, telling my stories.","I do see myself as an old-fashioned storyteller. But there's always a touch of the political in my plays.","My parents are avid consumers of art, collectors of African American paintings, and have always gone to the theater. My mother has always been an activist, too. As long as I can remember, we were marching in lines.","For me, the first thing is to tell a good story.","The theatre should reflect America as it's lived in today. And that is a multicultural America.","It's very important for me to have dialogues across racial lines.","Like Alice Walker and Toni Morrison, I try to balance reality with how we'd like the world to be.","Ultimately, we're incredibly resilient creatures. People really do get on with the business of living.","Winning the second Pulitzer firmly places me in conversation with this culture.","I don't think any of us could predict Trump. Trump is the stuff of nightmares. But in talking to people, I knew there was a tremendous level of disaffection and anger and sorrow. I know people felt misrepresented and voiceless.","There were not a lot of women in the theater department - it was really run by men, and so the message was that women can be onstage, but women can't really be backstage.","I'm a contemporary playwright in a postmodern world.","In my family history, there are generations of women who were abandoned by men. It's one of the themes of my family.","'Intimate Apparel' is a lyrical meditation on one woman's loneliness and desire. 'Fabulation' is a very fast-paced play of the MTV generation.","Who wants to see the same play again? I certainly don't want to write the same play again and again.","I know what I'm trying to say, so I'm always open to learning how to say it.","The act of saying what you do helps shape you as an artist.","My fears about where theater is going - it's the Hollywood model, where people are chasing the almighty dollar and making commercial decisions based on nothing more than generating income for themselves and their theaters.","There was no way I was going to write about Africa and not include the triumphant continuity of life that had also been part of my experience there. It's not just war and famine all the time.","Saying, 'I'm going to create jobs' is great, but before you create jobs, something has to be offered to alleviate some of the suffering now.","American audiences very rarely deal with material outside their borders.","We need to diversify the people who are backstage and producing and marketing these shows. It's the limitations of these people that are holding Broadway back.","I always describe race as the final taboo in American theatre. There's a real reluctance to have that conversation in an open, honest way on the stage.","There is an enduring feeling that women can write domestic dramas but don't have the muscularity or the vision to write state-of-the-nation narratives.","What I often do when I'm writing, if I can't find that story, I go out and I hunt for it.","Here's the dilemma of the modern age: There used to be actions that workers could take, in the form of a strike. But now, that's being pre-empted by lockouts. They don't even have that leverage to protect their jobs.","I'm always hyperaware of the way in which working people are portrayed on the stage.","'Ruined' was a play which was somewhat of an anomaly in that I did not take a commission until it was finished because I really wanted to explore the subject matter unencumbered. Otherwise, I felt as though I'd have the voice of dramaturges and literary managers saying, 'This is great, but we'll never be able to produce it.'","It's very easy, when we're reading those articles on the 20th page of 'The New York Times,' to distance ourselves and say, 'It's someone else.'","My grandfather was a Pullman porter, and my father put his way through college by cleaning floors at night in the libraries. I understand that working people are in some way the bedrock of my existence and the existence of many people here."],"Lynn Redgrave":["I did become American citizen in order to vote. I lived in this country for a very long time and I finally reached the point where I thought, I'm often sticking my neck out on various issues as all human beings have a right to do.","I don't know how I dealt with it. I went to a shrink.","God always has another custard pie up his sleeve.","Well, right now, technically, I have no breast cancer.","They have - they do still hit me occasionally, and it's an overwhelming grief for what - even though my life is so good now, even including going through treatment for cancer, my life is incredible.","There were times after my marriage ended where, you know, I really felt like I was at the bottom of a mountain, there was a great big, fog up there, and I'm never going to cross to the other side.","So I - the thought that I would physically be different was - it's not a thrill, I have to tell you. It's kind of - it brings you up short. But I was able to look at it right away.","It eats you up. It eats you up. And you have to - I had a lot of help. I had a lot of therapy. And I was able to - because it was hard, you know, to - you can't just lay it on friends and children.","I'm also doing constant book readings, movies. You name it, I'm doing it.","I think - I think I've always been kind of - I used to think of myself as a piece of rubber when I was a kid because I was kind of very shy and very - very emotional about things, but I kind of would bounce back.","I find love from time to time.","I don't want to marry again. I did that.","I don't want to have to say, Honey, you know, could you turn off the sports channel because I'm not a big sports fan, and I don't love the television being on just for the sake of turning on. I'd like turning on for some thing specific.","I don't want marriage. You know why? Because I did that. I did it for 32 years.","I don't put off any time with my grandchildren. I don't put off a thing.","I believe I have lots of time. I have to believe that, that it won't come back, and that that's why I'm in good hands. But I also do live my life by putting nothing off.","He had Parkinson's disease for about, I'd say diagnosed for about 11 of the last years of his life. And treatment was not as good as it is now, of course. We're still going along and he died in '85 and he was 77.","But I'm looking at life, and I'm putting nothing off.","But I don't want anybody to say have the right to say well if you bloody Brits don't like it go home. And they have the right to say that if you haven't become a citizen.","As an actor, particularly because I'm - I would call myself a character actor. I change my look, my physical appearance and my body, my hair color, my whatever all the time for a role.","And yet, I suppose you mourn the loss or the death of what you thought your life was, even if you find your life is better after. You mourn the future that you thought you'd planned.","And so I was very grateful that I didn't do the British stiff upper lip, but I went straight to a therapist. And she was wonderful and helpful, and I went for about two years.","And maybe that's being the third child, although my entire family are very resilient - very, very resilient.","And I would urge all women to have that regular mammogram.","And I really also wanted to have the full-body scans to learn if it was anywhere else - and it wasn't - before I told them. So I didn't tell them, until for a week, and then I told them.","And I also am very nervous about implants. You know, I'm just nervous about all that. So I could still do it. I could think about it. But I needed to adapt to myself."],"Lynn Samuels":["I avoid my neighbors - luckily, my building has two exits.","I'm a Yente and I have a terrible accent.","It's so exciting to be doing radio on the cutting edge of technology. Being in on something new is the biggest thrill in the world.","I think there's nothing sadder than a pro athlete who plays past his prime.","Sports is all about money.","People think they're getting objective information, but they're not. They're getting news wrapped up in opinion.","I think if you are a black person or an Hispanic person, you are not as fond of Rudolph Giuliani as you are if you happen to be a white person. Because he has trampled on people's civil rights.","But Bill Clinton had the good taste to lie about his sexual peccadillos. He had the honor and the decency to want to cover it up.","To tell you the truth, I don't like talking too much once I leave this booth. I'm talked out."],"Lynn Schusterman":["To all of the young people out there who are creating social change or even fomenting social movements: hold on to your idealism and your belief in your ability to change the world. Your lofty goals demand attention and deserve support.","A Jewish community that is diverse and openly embraces all who seek to lead actively Jewish lives will be a Jewish community that is stronger and more enduring for generations to come.","Our people represent a tapestry of interwoven identities embodying the rich diversity of what it means to be Jewish.","I love spending time with young people. I love to hear about what they think. It keeps me young. And they need role models.","It took several years of trial and error, soul-searching and hard work to shape the ROI program into the ROI Community. In the first few years, we got to see the power of these gatherings and the resulting connections that spanned the globe. It inspired us to think about how we could transform an annual gathering into a year-round community.","The Jewish people are very diverse, and I believe this rich tapestry of identities and experiences strengthens our community.","My greatest hope is that we will see a day when Israel will stand tall as a symbol of belonging across the Jewish world, and when global citizens will look to Jerusalem as the vibrant, modern, inclusive capital of Israel.","I was a young girl the first time I learned about the concept of paying it forward.","As Jews, we are commanded to give tzedakah - an act of justice, not charity - because it is the righteous thing to do.","In my work with young Jewish adults in the gay community, I hear their stories of discrimination, of struggling for acceptance, of feeling invisible not for what they have done but simply for who they are.","Just as we rely on Israel as a continual source of inspiration and renewal, Israel relies on us.","When my husband Charles passed away in 2000, I took over as chair of our family's foundation. As I was mourning his loss, I also had to keep the foundation moving forward and to chart a course into what was then a very male-dominated philanthropic world.","I believe that if we are to continue to strengthen the social and economic fabric and future of this nation, we cannot tolerate laws that drive some of our best talent to choose between living in their country or with the person they love.","We in the Jewish community must ask ourselves what role we are going to play in changing policies and practices that discriminate against LGBT Americans. We have a special responsibility and civic duty to ensure that all Americans are treated with dignity and equality.","Together, we can build the kind of world in which we all seek to live, one of universal equality and justice.","The MLK Shabbat Suppers focused on the theme of educational inequity, which Dr. King considered inextricably linked to the struggle for equality and justice.","Across the Jewish community, the MLK Shabbat Suppers are part of Repair the World's multi-year effort to mobilize Jews across the nation to serve as tutors, mentors, and college access coaches for public school children.","A high school and college degree are linked to greater employment prospects, higher earning potential, and the ability to contribute more to our communities.","It is striking to see the magnitude of impact mentorship and tutoring can have on student performance and young lives.","Now is not the time for us to shy away from challenging ourselves to make substantive change for the better. We have the opportunity to raise the bar in the faith-based world by forging a culture in which inclusivity, diversity, and equality are paramount.","I believe that as we face unparalleled prosperity in some quarters and deep impoverishment in others, it is the willingness of the next generation to bridge the gap between the two that will return us to our sense of purpose and focus.","People often ask why I remain so optimistic, even in the face of the complex challenges we are facing in the Jewish world, in Israel and beyond. It's because I am so impressed and inspired by the young people I meet.","ROIers are always reaching out to me to share their appreciation for the experiences, opportunities and connections we have provided and also to express their excitement about taking the next step in their leadership journey.","As our parents planted for us, so will we plant for our children. When Charlie and I began our philanthropic journey, we wanted to focus our resources on planting seeds that would help perpetuate Jewish values and traditions for future generations and also contribute to repairing our world.","Charlie would be so proud of what these young people are accomplishing today and, in true Charlie fashion, would encourage them to walk to the very edge of their comfort zone and then take another step.","I would love people to understand that not everyone can give away $100, but everyone can take the time to help someone get across a street.","I very much believe in teaching young people about philanthropy, and to give back.","Even if you don't have a lot, you can help someone.","Imagine living in a state where businesses can legally refuse to serve people based on their sexual orientation. Where parents can force their children to undergo conversion therapy to 'cure' them of their 'homosexual tendencies.'","The people of Oklahoma deserve better. We deserve leadership that's willing and unafraid to take a public stand against bigotry and bullying.","ROI is full of talented entrepreneurs and professionals, and we want to help each of them tap into the incredible power the collective has to offer and to contribute what they can.","We will continue to make ROI as supportive, diverse and beneficial as possible and to meet the evolving needs of the members and communities we serve.","Our family was the most important part of Charlie's life. He loved us very much, and we adored him.","We must work together to strengthen Jerusalem as a modern, open capital and to foster welcoming, inclusive communities across the Jewish world. It is vital to the health and vibrancy of the global Jewish future and to ensuring a strong Israel.","I believe young people hold the key to building a vibrant global Jewish future, and we must invest in their passion and potential to do so.","I am proud to state that every national Jewish organization we support enforces non-discrimination practices around sexual orientation and that more than 70 percent have written policies in place covering gender identity and expression."],"Lynn Shelton":["I like to put people into situations that are out of their comfort zone and see what happens.","I'm really fascinated by the self and how our selves shift and change over time and in relationship to different people.","So many people have said this, but it's true: 95 percent of what I do as a director is casting and getting people who can bear the load of what you're asking them to do and creating this emotionally safe environment.","I feel like this is the way I was meant to interact with acting. Which is as a director, and helping, working with actors to find their way. Facilitating their performances is so satisfying for me.","I always knew that I was an artist. I never expected to be able to make a living.","When I started working in film, I loved photography, I loved the image, I loved telling the story within a frame, but as I started playing around with film and video, it was like, 'Oh my god.' You just have so much more to play with.","Before adolescence I had an incredible voice. Like when I was 12, 13, 14 - I was taking acting classes, I was painting, I was making music, I was taking photographs. I was kind of exploding creatively, and then something about adolescence really just ground that out of me.","By the time I hit college, my secret shame was the reason I was an actor was my own words sort of dried up. I stopped writing. I stopped being able to form my own vision. That's actually what my first feature is about - looking back at two different selves.","Truth be told, I hear stories every day that would make you say, 'If you put that in a movie, you wouldn't believe it.' Real life really is kinda incredible; the stories from people's actual lives defy credibility. People's lives are messy, humans are messy, and they're flawed.","I can't wait to do a fully improvised script again, to find people who are really comfortable and into it. It's about the capabilities of the people you're working with, what are their strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most brilliant actors need the spine of the text to work off of, and there's no shame in that; they're actors, not writers.","Although humor is present in every one of my films, it has always been used as a way to make the darker, heavier stuff in my stories more palatable. I never set out to make 'Humpday' a comedy.","Hmm, can I be obvious and say there is probably a double standard for male vs. female directors? Sadly, I think that's actually the case. And it probably stems from the fact that there are proportionately so many fewer women directors than men ones that each project is perhaps more closely scrutinized for its content.","You wake up one day and you realize that all these years have gone by and I have this mortgage and I have this couch and I have this life and... is this going to be my prison?","I had a background in theater as an actor, and then a photographer, and then as an experimental filmmaker and editor.","I don't have a desire to make films that have cardboard cut-out or Hollywood stand-in replicas of humans. I need the real deal.","Flaws make us all human, and you're rooting for characters because of those flaws. It's ageless if you're interested in relationships and the way people can or can't relate to each other.","For me, I want to see diversity in storytelling sources because we live in a very diverse society, and the stories are for the whole society. That's really important. For me, as a female filmmaker, when I was out on the festival circuit on 2006, I felt like such a freaking anomaly - an oddity.","I'd love for there to be a situation - a world in which that's just not even a question anymore. We are all filmmakers - different stripes, genders, sexual orientations, colors - and our work can be taken on its own terms. I'm really looking forward to that day.","I've fallen for straight men, I've fallen for gay men, I've fallen for straight women and gay women. I really have. I had crushes on really every single kind of person in the world.","There's always so much more that can be conveyed on screen visually in the expressions of people's faces, in their bodies, in their body language. And also with sound design, with music.","I can connect with whoever I want to connect with in the world. And I can also write my own script. I don't have to follow rules. I can sort of just be unconventional.","All we really want in life is to connect to other human beings, and when you desperately want to connect physically to one specific human being and you can't? That's something I find compelling.","I'm drawn again and again to relationships between people who really, really want to connect and just can't get out of their own way to do it.","My mom was in education, and I remember reading in one of her books about multiple intelligences - this whole theory about how there are all these different ways you can be intelligent, like eight or 10 of them or something. And one of them is emotional."],"Lynn Swann":["I took several years of dance lessons that included ballet, tap and jazz. They helped a great deal with body control, balance, a sense of rhythm, and timing.","Now, I'm not here because I was that good. I'm here because of the people around me made me that good.","Professional sports is a business.","Some people play very, very well just so they won't get embarrassed.","I believe that today's players who are Christians feel that it's important and their responsibility to acknowledge their faith.","I think that most minorities have experienced some form of racial abuse.","I enjoy playing the game. It's hard for me to just watch it, even while broadcasting.","Sports and entertainment have always been windows of opportunity for African Americans, when other doors were closed.","And historically the owners have used loyalty to a team or a city to hold players as opposed to always paying their worth.","Players today are concerned about the money, but the large dollars only go to those players who are the best.","If a player demonstrated that he is the best, and a team decides, even so, we don't want to pay him, as in any other business, he should be able to play elsewhere.","I feel like there should be more black head coaches.","Very often we see coaches who have not been successful being recycled, instead of looking to a new face or a new name who has demonstrated the ability to handle the job.","When I was in college there was a girls' flag football league. The girls were extremely aggressive.","Take the time to discover how African-Americans have had a great impact on this country. In science, education, literature, art, and politics.","We talk about freedoms for African-Americans but unless you have more than one option politically, how free are you?","I was not a very good football player when I started out."],"Lynn Westmoreland":["The greatest threat to the constitutional right to vote is voter fraud.","What the Democrats don't seem to understand is that higher taxes mean fewer American jobs and less American production.","Trust me, I'm going to find out where the money has gone and how it has been spent, and see if we can't get it down there quicker to let that rebuilding start.","The Women of the Storm made a big difference for me, because it really put some real-life faces with the situation, and not just politicians.","The condition in New Orleans was changing every day. I said, why don't we appropriate another $10 billion, come back and look at the situation, and do another $10 billion every week, or every 10 days?","I'm going to go back and find out where the money is. The money is not getting down there.","I think these ladies, that group of 130 women, are going to make a difference in what goes on down there, because they're going to hold the locals' feet to the fire.","I talked to General Downer about some of the funding about the National Guard and some of the civil defense workers, the firefighters, the police officers, and the way that FEMA is making them spend that money. We have got a problem there."],"Lynn Whitfield":["The metamorphosis of people is so interesting. I guess that's why everybody loves before and afters, throwback Thursdays, and all that kind of thing.","I think water seeks its own level, that we go through challenges to become better. And now more than ever, it's good to look at who you're following in any type of hierarchy or institution - be it a church or the government. We can see how easy it is for people to lose their footing when they have great power.","I have always been part of a family with a great appreciation for the arts.","What I'm really praying is that we, as a people, understand that we are interdependent upon each other. We don't want police to leave; we want policing in our world. But I think that people aren't comfortable with each other.","Even the toughest people have a backstory, and villains don't feel like they're the bad guys.","They call Howard University the 'capstone of black education.' Howard was one of the historically black colleges where people want to go and send their children. Both of my grandfathers went through the medical school, and being in D.C., not far from New York City, it was a natural choice for me.","Apparently, I hear from people I always play strong women. I don't see them that way.","A spiritual relationship to me is much more about making your own connection to the divinity that you believe in and much less about the person - the shepherd - who's overseeing it all.","I wouldn't want to be a mother that put blinders on and didn't see what was going on with my child. There can be huge consequences to such a thing.","I would love to do espionage like 'The Thomas Crown Affair,' that kind of thing. And I've always had a fascination with madams. It's interesting to me what that institution is like, how those women are.","Funny enough though, despite what Donald Trump has to say and the way African-American people are portrayed so often in media, African-American people can have a leaning to be very conservative.","I think that huge Christian institutions deal a lot with corruption. You see it happen with so many institutions. We've seen the questions with Catholicism, we've seen the questions with some other mega churches that really do exist.","The life of an artist is always reproving what you can do, and I feel like there is still so much more to do. Because I still enjoy it, and I'm not one of those actors who feels like, 'Oh, I've arrived and you should worship at my altar,' kind of thing.","I think Marvin Gaye is one of the greatest American music icons. His 'What's Going On' is as fresh today as when he did it.","Many of the people I know and that you know are very complex human beings, and it's not all about race. Everything isn't a question of race. Everything isn't a question of economics at the very base level.","I never studied interior design, but I'm a creative person. And what we surround ourselves with is very important - what makes you feel happy, what makes your senses feel good.","At consignment shops, I can collect things reasonably, and it's joyful. My dining room table was $75, and I'm so proud. It's beautiful.","I wanted to do what I was seeing Dorothy Dandridge doing, what I saw Marilyn Monroe do, what I saw Bette Davis do. I wanted to do that: to tell stories. I wanted to make people laugh, make people cry. I wanted to be a storyteller.","I am very loyal to the women I am fully licensed to.","When I saw 'Breakfast at Tiffany's,' and Audrey Hepburn was standing in front of Tiffany's in this Givenchy dress, or when I saw 'All About Eve,' I thought that period was just fabulous. I mean, who would not want to walk down the stairs with their hands in their pockets, and say, 'Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy ride.'","We did a play in the third grade all about Winter not wanting to give over his throne to Spring. That was my first title role, and I took full advantage of it. I felt like there was no one else on that stage but Ms. Spring.","Law enforcement agents need to be vetted more thoroughly and psychologically and emotionally to see who they are, if they're really built for fairness in all communities.","I started at Howard in the drama department. At the same time, I was a fledgling member of the Black Repertory Company in Washington, D.C. When I graduated, I had the great fortune of being in the Los Angeles production of 'For Colored Girls'... And all these years since, I've done stage work.","Josephine Baker is such an iconic woman that once you've touched her and she has touched you, it never goes away. I'm stuck with her. I'm sure 50 years from now, when they write my obituary, they will mention that I played Josephine Baker. It'll be on my epitaph.","When men age, their love interests get younger. It doesn't stop them from doing different genres of stuff. As women age in film, you know, they go from the woman in charge to the mother, the grandmother... off a cliff somewhere."],"Lynne Cheney":["Expecting to be able to get rid of the competitive drive, first of all, flies in the face of human nature - and little girls certainly have this drive, as much as little boys do, or at least the little girls I have observed in my immediate family have it.","There can be differences of opinion without there being personal differences.","I soon discovered, after I became chairman of the NEH, that, for a number of academics, the truth was not merely irrelevant - it no longer existed.","Well, my father's people were Mormon, and had immigrated not long after Brigham Young had settled Utah.","You know, my mother had a rule which was 'people are just people.'","Casper Wyo., population 18,000 when I was born, was large enough to hold the surprises of civilization, but small enough that the prairie was close by - for some in our town, right out the front door - stretching on forever, under the great curving sky."],"Lynne Doughtie":["Strategy is the starting point for a transformation that needs to occur and how that company must change to win.","The most resilient companies foster a pervasive culture of innovation at all levels of the organization - one that values risk-taking, embraces experimentation and considers failure an inevitable part of thinking boldly.","Leaders need to model the values of their organizations in ways that encourage inclusive behavior. This means inspiring others to collaborate and work together; ensuring everyone is heard and ideas are shared.","Mentors and sponsors are beneficial for personal and career growth.","Innovation demands risk-taking - which, in turn, entails redefining failure, stripping away its power to inhibit.","We have always believed that the most successful solutions reflect a diversity of skills, thinking, experiences, and outlooks.","'Failing fast' is an important component of cultivating the agility needed for a development project along with continually rebalancing your innovation portfolio.","Innovation can't just happen within the walls of your own organization.","The importance of inclusive behavior was modeled for me early in life. I have many childhood memories of my mother - an entrepreneur and business owner - drawing people to herself and inspiring them with the genuineness of her interest in them.","Different perspectives, experiences, and insights improve decision-making and lead to superior performance.","Don't wait for someone to tap you on the shoulder. Make your goals known and proactively develop relationships with those that can help get you there either in the form of mentors or sponsors.","Cultivating innovative thinking starts at the top. Leaders can foster a culture of innovation by encouraging creativity and experimenting with new ideas.","Sponsorship is about putting your name and reputation on the line for someone else. It could be as simple as recommending someone for a new role, yet it's one of the most powerful cultural tools any organization has.","Too often, women are waiting for someone to recognise their great work and tap them on the shoulder and say, 'Here - this is the next thing we want you to do,' and that may happen. But I feel you need to take more ownership of telling your story, advocating for yourself. You can do it in a way that's positive and that your leaders will appreciate.","The biggest challenge for a leader is harnessing the rapid pace of change in technology, as that is going to impact every industry and every organization.","At KPMG, we believe that companies with inclusive and diverse cultures are better positioned to adapt, grow, and thrive in a changing business environment.","When women are starting out in their careers, they tend to be confident and look to aspire to leadership role and really want those positions. But then over time, as they advance, they become less confident and don't think they can attain those roles.","Providing career growth and development opportunities for our people is of paramount importance, and that's why we surround and support our diverse employee team with investments in innovation, technology, training, and a wide variety of programs so they can build great careers. 'Fortune' saw that in KPMG, and we're delighted.","The most effective way to do it is to do it.","The best leaders begin with an environment that embraces and rewards change and innovation.","At KPMG, we are intentional about leading with inclusion because we believe it strengthens our ability to make a tangible difference for our clients, our people, and society.","KPMG is committed to the highest standards of professionalism, , and quality, and we are dedicated to the capital markets we serve.","Convergence and the blurring of lines across industries creates the opportunity for women to really excel.","I have found that women are really in their element in a very collaborative approach.","Leaders have to consider whether they have the right diverse perspectives at the table.","I think there's a tendency with some women especially to internalize and think, 'I have to be perfect at everything before I'm going to put myself out there.' We've got to change that mindset. And I think it starts with confidence.","Innovation tends to be quite siloed in most organizations. There is usually a group over in one corner charged with innovation rather than making it everyone's responsibility.","If you truly want to innovate, there will be some failures, and this can be difficult for some organizations - especially public companies managing quarterly earnings.","It's important to understand the big difference between a mentor and sponsor. I was fortunate that I had both, and my sponsors have been both men and women.","I tell women to not make hasty decision based on circumstances on just that moment in time. Press the pause button.","When I was growing up, I just saw my mother as a successful businesswoman and awesome mother, so I never really thought, 'I can't do it.' I saw how she worked hard, served clients really well, was a great mum to us.","Innovation has to be pervasive.","I'm passionate about making a difference in increasing the quality of life and survivorship for all affected by lung cancer, having lost my mother and grandmother to this terrible disease.","We have to do more than tell women they need sponsors. We have to identify high-potential women by name and strategically map them to those who can help them get to the next level.","Since there is always a risk that an innovation will fail, you must be able to pivot quickly when an idea doesn't perform as planned.","Culture is nourished by human motivation - a limitless resource that can sometimes be underestimated.","The most forward-leaning leaders are single-minded about creating company cultures that foster a true spirit of innovation.","You can build many relationships with people while playing 18 holes, no matter how good you are.","Collaborating with startups and other technology companies can be very beneficial because it broadens the scope of services we offer to clients while allowing us to serve clients together.","Many of the strategy houses don't have the depth of world-class risk capability that a KPMG has, particularly in industries where regulation is a key driver, such as financial services or healthcare.","The potential for cognitive and related technologies to help us pursue new business offerings is extraordinary.","KPMG's use of IBM Watson technology will help advance our team's ability to analyze and act on the core financial and operational data so central to the health of organizations and the capital markets.","As part of KPMG, Cynergy's people and processes can help clients leverage digital and mobile technologies to transform existing customer engagement and employee mobile enablement into seamless experiences for end users across multiple platforms and devices.","I started playing golf when I was just out of college and starting my career with KPMG. I took a few lessons, and my husband has always loved to give me pointers - for better and for worse! I realized that you could really enhance relationships by being on the course with clients. In fact, my very first golf game was with some clients.","My personality is to want to be the best at everything.","Golf isn't one of the things I'm best at. You're in a situation where you're vulnerable when you're not a good player. But what I've found is that those are the times that you can build the most lasting relationships.","If you're open and honest, you find that people genuinely want to help you out. Taking advice from others can enhance your relationship, especially if you can laugh about things.","The KPMG Women's PGA Championship provides a fantastic platform for us to demonstrate our commitment to elevating women in business and the sport of golf through the Championship, KPMG Women's Leadership Summit, and KPMG Future Leaders Program."],"Lynne Reid Banks":["The '50s in general are written off as a boring decade following the turmoil of the Second World War and its immediate aftermath - the postwar Labour government, the cold war, the arrival of the New Look in fashion, etc. But I remember it as a very exciting time - a pioneering, rule-breaking time, especially for the young.","I find writing for children much easier. I don't mean it's less demanding - you've got to have a talent for it and you've got to work very hard - but you don't have to pull your guts out and lay them on the line in quite the same way as when you're writing for adults.","Innocence is ignorance.","The BBC is very good at period drama - world-famous for getting the details right.","I remember the mid-'50s well. It was when my life changed, and I left acting to become one of the first female television news reporters in the U.K."],"Lynne Truss":["Writers and painters alike are in the business of consulting their own imaginations, and stimulating the imaginations of others. Together, and separately, they celebrate the absolute mystery of otherness.","My favorite thing in the world is a quiz show, 'University Challenge,' so you can see what kind of sad person I am.","Texting is a supremely secretive medium of communication - it's like passing a note - and this means we should be very careful what we use it for.","Texting is a fundamentally sneaky form of communication, which we should despise, but it is such a boon we don't care. We are all sneaks now.","Oh, the illusion of choice in the modern world - don't get me started. But don't you agree that the Internet has softened our brains and made us forget that 'choice' used to mean something different from selecting options from menus?","You don't want to make an enemy of Piers Morgan.","I do needlepoint from kits. I give them as gifts to people in the form of cushion covers and they are often speechless with horror.","I used to help my dad with a stall selling eggs when I was about 12. People were so hard up they would ask for one egg. But mostly no one came by at all. It was very demoralising.","As with email, the recipient of a texted question seems to have the option to ignore it, while nevertheless saying, 'Hello, lovely day,' and so on.","One of the things that all authors of fiction must learn to judge is whether - and in what detail - to describe the face of a character.","After university, I got a job sub-editing and for years I was a literary editor.","I hate to be treated as if I'm invisible. I get incensed when people talk across me or refuse to catch my eye in a restaurant or shop.","Old radio comedy makes me laugh, as well as 'I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue' and comedians like Paul Merton.","To some people, the fact that I am not married, or don't have children, would be the reason I have written a book on punctuation.","What I have always liked about Brighton is its impersonality. Since the 18th century, people have come, used the place and gone home again.","I am not against marriage. I lived with someone for 11 years. But we weren't in love, and I thought that was quite important.","Do you lend books and DVDs to people? If so, don't you always regret it? All my life I have forced books on to people who have subsequently forgotten all about it. Meanwhile, on my shelves sit many orphaned books loaned to me over the years by trusting, innocent souls - some as long ago as the Seventies.","Nice clothes fall apart. Nice clocks don't work. Bits fall off the nice cooker. It is hard to accept that pricing is unrelated to quality, but it's plainly true. Nowadays, we pay the price that satisfies our particular personality type; and then we live with the painful consequences.","Don't pessimism and caution naturally go hand in hand?","All writers learn this, in time: don't show your work to other people until it's safely finished. Even discussing your unborn book in quite general terms can be such an undermining experience that, afterwards, you give it up and go to live in Guatemala.","What one discovers in life, I find, is that one's personality defects don't come and go.","The idea of withholding a massive secret is obviously quite exciting to some people. It is also the basis of much classic drama, of course, from Sophocles onwards.","In my worst moments, I think the biggest effect of 'Eats, Shoots & Leaves' was to kill the happiness of people who had previously skipped through life, unaware of all the atrocities lurking in the world around them."],"Lynsey Addario":["I think it's important to have perspective and to look at what you don't necessarily want to see.","I was kidnapped by Sunni insurgents near Fallujah, in Iraq, ambushed by the Taliban in the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan, and injured in a car accident that killed my driver while covering the Taliban occupation of the Swat Valley in Pakistan.","With photography, I always think that it's not good enough.","I always knew my death would be a possible consequence of the work I do. But for me it was a price I was willing to pay because this is what I believed in.","Nothing seemed more important to me than to make the world aware of the senseless death and starvation in South Sudan. I wanted people to see through the eyes of the suffering so my photos might motivate the international community to act.","You have to believe 100 percent in what you're doing, that some picture or some thing we do is going to change the world in some tiny, minute way.","Where in the world would I rather be than on the front line of history?","If I'm doing a story on how a single mother copes in a refugee camp, I'll go to her tent; I'll follow her when she's working, see what her daily life is like, and try to pack that into one composition, with nice light, in one frame.","As a photographer who is constantly in violent, bloody situations where the instinct is to turn away, I am always trying to figure out how to make people not turn away.","In a place like Afghanistan where the society is completely segregated, women have access to women. Men cannot always photograph women and cannot get the access that I get.","Don't expect things to happen fast. Be empathetic with the people you are photographing. Don't be concerned about money.","For a journalist who covers the Muslim world, we have responsibilities to be familiar with that culture and to know how to respond to that.","It seems like, yeah, of course - I always think my work is important, or I wouldn't risk my life for it.","I remember the moment in which we were taken hostage in Libya, and we were asked to lie face down on the ground, and they started putting our arms behind our backs and started tying us up. And we were each begging for our lives because they were deciding whether to execute us, and they had guns to our heads.","I wanted to continue doing my work, but I had to figure out how. And so what I have basically come up with is that I still go to Afghanistan and Iraq and South Sudan and many of these places that are rife with war, but I don't go directly to the front line.","You have two options when you approach a hostile checkpoint in a war zone, and each is a gamble. The first is to stop and identify yourself as a journalist and hope that you are respected as a neutral observer. The second is to blow past the checkpoint and hope the soldiers guarding it don't open fire on you.","I had imposed unspeakable worry on my husband, Paul de Bendern, on more occasions than I could count.","The truth is, the difference between a studio photographer and a photojournalist is the same as the difference between a political cartoonist and an abstract painter; the only thing the two have in common is the blank page. The jobs entail different talents and different desires.","Sometimes when I am photographing a major news event, I am suddenly overwhelmed by helplessness.","One day I am at home, watching dramatic images of Iraqi Yazidis fleeing for their lives being aired nonstop on 24-hour news channels. Days later, I am there, staring at tens of thousands of displaced Iraqis and feeling a 35-millimeter frame cannot capture the scope of devastation and heartbreak before me.","I had first visited Kurdistan in 2003 before the invasion of Iraq, camping out in Erbil and Sulaimaniya while waiting for Saddam Hussein's fall.","To me, it's so much about doing your homework, going into a situation, getting to know the subject, making them feel comfortable, getting intimate access, getting access to all different aspects of people's lives so that I am essentially telling an entire story and not just a single image.","I think when I started going to war zones and started covering humanitarian issues, it became a calling because I realized I had a voice, and I can give people without a voice a voice... and now it is something that sits inside of me every day.","I didn't know a single female photographer who covered conflict who even had a boyfriend, much less a husband or a baby.","A lot of women act like it's the easiest decision, and I'm just going to have a baby and put my life on hold and not be worried about it. Well, I was worried.","I would never think of myself as a role model.","I've seen so many photographers rush to do books the minute they start shooting, but one great thing about photography is that the images don't go away, so the more I sit with these images, the more I learn which ones have had the most impact.","I've always wanted to do a photo book, but I've never done one because I've never felt ready; I just didn't feel my work was good enough.","I interviewed dozens and dozens of African women who had endured more hardship and trauma than most Westerners even read about, and they ploughed on. I often openly cried during interviews, unable to process this violence and hatred towards women I was witnessing.","I got rejected from journalism school!","I do think my childhood is one of the fundamental reasons that I'm able to do my job. We were raised in this totally nonjudgmental family. We never knew who was going to walk in the front door. And as a journalist and a photographer, you walk into so many different scenes that you have to be open to everything.","My life isn't always at risk, even if I'm in a war zone. A lot of these places have areas of calm, so covering war doesn't necessarily mean being shot at all the time.","My strength is looking for composition and light, and I think those things come in the quieter times of war or photographing people affected on the margins of war - civilians, refugees; that is where I really excel.","As a woman, I have tried to take advantage of the extra access I have in the Muslim world: with Muslim women, for example. Many people underestimate women in that part of the world because, typically, they don't work.","Obviously I am a photographer and I believe in my medium: I do think that powerful photographs can force change. It doesn't take long to look and be engaged in a strong image whereas, with a story, you have to actually sit down and pause and be involved in it.","As a war correspondent and a mother, I've learned to live in two different realities... but it's my choice. I choose to live in peace and witness war - to experience the worst in people but to remember the beauty.","The fact is that trauma and risk taking hadn't become scarier over the years; it had become more normal.","I was lucky because I had parents who have enabled me to do whatever I was passionate about and never held my siblings and me back from anything. But I think a lot of people don't have that experience.","I grew up in Connecticut, going in and out of New York City, and I worked in the city in the '90s. I was freelancing for the Associated Press, and I fell in love with New York.","I think that more often than not, people underestimate me.","If publications want to publish images and stories from a certain person, they should put that person on assignment, cover his or her expenses, make sure they have access to security briefings and experts, someone to administer first aid, etc.","I never went to school for photography and started when I was pretty young. I was somewhere around 12 or 13. I started photographing as a hobby and carried that hobby through high school and university.","I started freelancing for the Associated Press. I had a great mentor there who sort of taught me everything.","Let's get one thing straight: I am not an adrenaline junkie. Just because you cover conflict doesn't mean you thrive on adrenaline. It means you have a purpose, and you feel it is very important for people back home to see what is happening on the front line, especially if we are sending American soldiers there.","As a Western woman in the Middle East, I am often put in a different category. I am sort of like the third sex. I am not treated like a man. I am not treated like a woman. I am just treated like a journalist. That is usually really helpful.","Most people, when they meet me, one of the first things they say is, 'Why would you voluntarily subject yourself to war? Why would you go into these places where you know there's a risk of getting killed?'","To me, it's so much about doing your homework, going into a situation, getting to know the subject, making them feel comfortable, getting intimate access, getting access to all different aspects of people's lives, so that I am essentially telling an entire story and not just a single one.","When I'm documenting, for example, a story on women in Afghanistan, I will do a huge amount of research and a lot of time on the ground just getting to know the women before I even start shooting.","For me, it's more about being there, bearing witness to history, bearing witness to what's happening, what our country, the position our country is taking overseas. I want policy-makers to see the fruits of their decisions, basically, and to try and influence foreign policy.","I'm not very religious at all - I was raised Catholic, but probably haven't gone to church since my Holy Communion when I was about 6 or 7.","I've worked for over 11 years in the Muslim world, and the one thing that I feel like I've learned - who's to say if it's true or not true, it's just my experience - is that men don't like to see really strong, aggressive women in that area of the world.","Journalists dedicate their lives to covering war - they make many personal sacrifices, and it's not something that's gender-based. In a place like Libya where there's heavy fighting, it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman.","Becoming a mother hasn't necessarily changed how I shoot, but it certainly has made me more sensitive, and it certainly makes it much harder for me to photograph dying children.","When I first started out, I really felt like, 'I'm a journalist; I will be respected as a neutral observer.' And I don't feel like that holds true anymore. I don't think people respect journalists the same way they once did.","It's very hard to turn your back once you're aware of what's going on, and you're aware of the injustices, and you're aware of the civilian casualties. It's much easier if you have no idea and you've never seen it.","The possibility to mobilize the international community to act on human suffering is what drives me every day as a photojournalist.","I've rarely seen portrayals of photojournalists that seem accurate.","The first time I visited Afghanistan in May 2000, I was 26 years old, and the country was under Taliban rule. I went there to document Afghan women and landmine victims.","The Taliban rose to power in 1996, vowing stability and an end to the violence raging across the country between warring mujahedeen factions, and to implement rule by Sharia law, or strict Islamic rule.","By the time the United States went to war with Afghanistan in the fall of 2001, I had made three trips to the country. I covered the fall of the Taliban in Kandahar and have been returning routinely for the past 14 years.","For me, taking photographs is such a tortured process. I'm always feeling like I'm not getting enough: I'm in the wrong place, the light isn't good, the subject's not comfortable.","I wanted the ideal personal life, but I also wanted to keep rushing off, and that doesn't work, not unless you've got an incredibly understanding partner.","I'm a very open person, very self-deprecating. I accept my flaws.","I was undeterred by the danger of traveling as a single American woman through Taliban-governed land. I believed in the stories I wanted to tell, the stories I felt were underreported, and I was convinced that that belief would keep me alive.","With each assignment, I weigh the looming possibility of being killed, and I chastise myself for allowing fear to hinder me. War photographers aren't supposed to get scared.","In so many countries, Western journalists are viewed simply as dollar signs. We're ransom objects.","Photography of any living being, according to Taliban rule, was illegal. So when I went to Afghanistan, immediately I was worried about photographing people. But it was what I wanted: to show what life was like under the Taliban, specifically for women.","I'm not the kind of person to sit and dwell for ages on something that happened. I go through something, I experience it, I try to learn from it, and I move forward.","I'm constantly struggling. You know, the stories that I feel like I could cover, do the work that I want to do and being a mother. That's really where my struggle is - and being a wife and having a life - and for me it's really hard to find that balance. I'm always struggling to find that balance.","I think, for me, personally, I try to be sensitive to issues as I learn about them. And I also try to constantly become not only a certain type of person but also become more in tune to the issues I'm covering. As I get older, I think that things just affect me more.","For me personally, I'm constantly trying to really re-negotiate how I'm going to make a living because I can't make a living solely off editorial. And I'm also still trying to tell long feature stories that are harder and harder to get assigned, you know.","I knew that my interest lied in international stories. I was interested in how women were living under the Taliban, for example.","Since Sept. 11, many of the wars of our generation are in the Muslim world. So as a woman, I have access to 50 percent of the population that my male colleagues don't.","If people really saw what was happening in Iraq and Afghanistan, then they might be marching in the streets to end wars. But you know, I think that no one ever sees because we're not allowed to see, and we're not allowed to publish what we do see. So it's quite difficult.","I generally don't follow domestic news that much aside from how it relates to the stories I'm covering abroad, like what Americans think of the War in Afghanistan.","Americans are really lovely people - friendly, kind and willing to help you out.","It was nice to be in my own country, where I didn't need a translator or a driver. Where I didn't need to figure out cultural references or what hijab I needed to wear to cover my hair.","I just immediately connect everything to the wars I have been covering overseas, and that's not the case back home. I wrongly assumed all Americans at home were as consumed with our troops in Afghanistan as I was abroad.","Family is such a fundamental part of Islam, and women run the family. I had to force myself not to impose my own definition of political and social freedom on women in Islam, and approach each story objectively.","The more I photographed Muslim women, the more I was able to metaphorically strip away the burqas and hijabs, and start chipping away at the profound misconceptions that existed in other parts of the world about these women and their culture.","I try not to get caught up in how our society is so inundated with images, and stay very focused on the work that I'm doing.","Every story takes its toll on me and leaves an impression on me.","My job is to take the pictures, communicate a message, to bring those images to the greater public through whatever publication I'm working for. My job is really to be a messenger, and that's what I've been doing.","I didn't want my gender to determine whether or not I could cover breaking news.","I think there were times when I first started out, when I was covering Iraq - I was basically living there in 2003 and 2004 - that car bombs and attacks became so the norm that it was weird for me to leave and realize that no one else actually cared about what was going on there.","Look, I would say that anyone who does this work and doesn't have a strain of idealism is an adrenaline junkie or completely narcissistic. There is no other justification. You're risking your life, and if anything happens, it's our families who suffer tremendously.","I come from a big family of hairdressers; they didn't read newspapers. I would say, 'I'm off to Afghanistan...' and they would say, 'Have fun!'"],"Lynsi Torres":["I had no idea In-N-Out was going to fall on my lap as soon as it did.","I like to fly under the radar.","I am a deeply spiritual and religious person both privately and publicly.","In-N-Out Burger has a well-known and long standing reputation as a corporation that is operated with a Christian message and philosophy.","Never sell, never franchise.","I was a daddy's girl.","I'm a lot like my dad: a little bit of a daredevil. I like an adrenaline rush.","My dad took me to the racetrack for the first time when I was 2 or 3... Anything with a motor, that was in my blood.","Drag racing has played a big role in In-N-Out's history, and it is also an important part of my family history."],"Lyor Cohen":["The primary part of the weekend is centered around my children, and I have to be flexible. To call an audible is to be liquid enough to understand that at any given time you have to be a chauffeur or a chaperone, especially for my 12-year-old and whatever her plans are.","My week is full-tilt boogie. I wake up every morning, and the singular thought in my head is that maybe today is the day that I'm going to find an artist who is so amazing, an artist who will change pop culture. I'm in hot pursuit, always.","I think it would be bad for culture and the art if artists and people who develop the apparatus to support those artists don't get paid.","Content that's generated out of America, whether it be film or music, has, in my opinion, much greater impact in sustaining our credibility and our place as a cultural capital. This is our great export.","I like moments of staleness and mildew, simply because it creates the lane for change.","Rap now is multi-generational, which has its own issues. My son is a big Cudi fan, but he does not like talking to me about Kid Cudi.","Everything gets thrown off depending on whether the Packers are playing. I grew up in L.A., and we had a terrible quarterback, Roman Gabriel. When I was 11 years old, I fired him, I fired the Rams, and I picked a quarterback I aspired to be. That was Bart Starr. That's how long I've been a Packers fan.","I used to have a gym in the house. I thought that was a fantastic luxury."],"Lyriq Bent":["It's a very organic feeling to have something really speak to you and kind of lay out the blueprint for you.","I can't hold a note. I tried a singing lesson, but my vocal coach kept giving me the stink eye.","When I was 19, I went door to door selling long-distance phone service to put myself through school. I was studying to become a computer graphic technician. I always got strangers saying, 'You should model; you should act.' A co-worker finally said, 'Go see this acting coach.'","I have played bad-guy roles, but they were significant to the story.","I particularly like Strellson because I love one-stop shopping. I don't like going store to store. I want to go to one store: look, see, buy, go. But shopping takes time. If I have three or four hours, I play golf.","As Jamaicans, we're very resilient and strong-willed people.","Sometimes you work with people, and you just don't want to even be in their space, but you do it because it's your job, you know.","For a very long time now, we've seen things one way, which is through the eyes of men. Quite frankly, I'm a little bit bored by our stories and the way we perceive things.","It resonates with me the way women tell stories, the way they see things, and the way they attach what they see to certain emotions.","It was so important that women were involved in 'She's Gotta Have It' because it's about a woman's opinion. It's about her views of herself, and the world around her, and how the world perceives her, and finding that ground for herself - not even a common ground, but that ground for herself in which she can walk on firmly with confidence.","My focus is films, and 'Angela's Eyes' is one of those TV projects that has some good TV concepts behind it and good writing.","My thing is film, really.","There are interesting tensions that will naturally occur with any relationship. No matter what setting, what era, the tension is very, very real. It's basic human tension."],"Lysander Spooner":["A man's natural rights are his own, against the whole world; and any infringement of them is equally a crime, whether committed by one man, or by millions; whether committed by one man, calling himself a robber, (or by any other name indicating his true character,) or by millions, calling themselves a government.","A traitor is a betrayer - one who practices injury, while professing friendship. Benedict Arnold was a traitor, solely because, while professing friendship for the American cause, he attempted to injure it. An open enemy, however criminal in other respects, is no traitor.","But whether the Constitution really be one thing, or another, this much is certain - that it has either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it. In either case, it is unfit to exist.","If two individuals enter into a contract to commit trespass, theft, robbery or murder upon a third, the contract is unlawful and void, simply because it is a contract to violate natural justice, or men's natural rights.","But for their right to judge of the law, and the justice of the law, juries would be no protection to an accused person, even as to matters of fact; for, if the government can dictate to a jury any law whatever, in a criminal case, it can certainly dictate to them the laws of evidence.","A man is no less a slave because he is allowed to choose a new master once in a term of years.","If taxation without consent is robbery, the United States government has never had, has not now, and is never likely to have, a single honest dollar in its treasury. If taxation without consent is not robbery, then any band of robbers have only to declare themselves a government, and all their robberies are legalized.","If any man's money can be taken by a so-called government, without his own personal consent, all his other rights are taken with it; for with his money the government can, and will, hire soldiers to stand over him, compel him to submit to its arbitrary will, and kill him if he resists.","A government that can at pleasure accuse, shoot, and hang men, as traitors, for the one general offence of refusing to surrender themselves and their property unreservedly to its arbitrary will, can practice any and all special and particular oppressions it pleases.","Legislators and judges are necessarily exposed to all the temptations of money, fame, and power, to induce them to disregard justice between parties, and sell the rights, and violate the liberties of the people. Jurors, on the other hand, are exposed to none of these temptations.","The apology, that is constantly put forth for the injustice of government, viz., that a man must consent to give up some of his rights, in order to have his other rights protected - involves a palpable absurdity, both legally and politically.","If a jury have not the right to judge between the government and those who disobey its laws, and resist its oppressions, the government is absolute, and the people, legally speaking, are slaves.","Those who deny the right of a jury to protect an individual in resisting an unjust law of the government, deny him all defence whatsoever against oppression.","The greatest of all crimes are the wars that are carried on by governments, to plunder, enslave, and destroy mankind.","Doing a thing by law, or according to law, is only carrying the law into execution. And punishing a man by, or according to, the sentence or judgment of his peers, is only carrying that sentence or judgment into execution.","The right and the physical power of the people to resist injustice, are really the only securities that any people ever can have for their liberties. Practically no government knows any limit to its power but the endurance of the people.","Vices are simply the errors which a man makes in his search after his own happiness. Unlike crimes, they imply no malice toward others, and no interference with their persons or property.","The mere toleration of the slave trade could not make slavery itself - the right of property in man - lawful any where; not even on board the slave ship. Toleration of a wrong is not law.","Any number of scoundrels, having money enough to start with, can establish themselves as a 'government'; because, with money, they can hire soldiers, and with soldiers extort more money; and also compel general obedience to their will.","Money is the great instrumentality for manufacturing.","To say that majorities, as such, have a right to rule minorities, is equivalent to saying that minorities have, and ought to have, no rights, except such as majorities please to allow them.","If men were but to read the New Testament with the same tone and emphasis, with which they do other books, and were to keep out of mind the idea of its being sacred, they would be disgusted with the credulity, and the want of intellect, reason and judgment, that is apparent in it.","No court presumes to tell a jury that they are to try a capital case with the same indifference and unconcern as to consequences, that they would a case where the results of their decision would be less important.","Legally speaking, the term 'public rights' is as vague and indefinite as are the terms 'public health,' 'public good,' 'public welfare,' and the like. It has no legal meaning, except when used to describe the separate, private, individual rights of a greater or less number of individuals.","The very idea of law originates in men's natural rights. There is no other standard, than natural rights, by which civil law can be measured. Law has always been the name of that rule or principle of justice, which protects those rights. Thus we speak of natural law.","It is a natural impossibility for any man to make a binding contract, by which he shall surrender to others a single one of what are commonly called his 'natural, inherent, inalienable rights.'","There can be no criminal intent in resisting injustice.","Now a slave is not 'held' by any legal contract, obligation, duty, or authority, which the laws will enforce. He is 'held' only by brute force. One person beats another until the latter will obey him, work for him, if he require it, or do nothing if he require it.","If the works of Jesus were so much more wonderful than man could perform as to deserve to be called miracles, was it not nonsense to caution his disciples so strongly against being deluded by the works of others?","Now it is clear, that if the government can exclude, on account either of their opinions or feelings, any persons thus drawn by lot, the trial is no longer a trial by 'the country,' but only by a portion of the country.","It is manifest that the only security against the tyranny of the government lies in forcible resistance to the execution of the injustice; because the injustice will certainly be executed, unless it be forcibly resisted.","But that the people are stronger than the government, and will resist in extreme cases, our governments would be little or nothing else than organized systems of plunder and oppression.","Martyrdom is evidence only of a man's honesty - it is no evidence that he is not mistaken. Men have suffered martyrdom for all sorts of opinions in politics and in religion; yet they could not therefore have all been in the right; although they could give no stronger evidence that they believed themselves in the right.","There is perhaps not an enlightened Christian in America who, notwithstanding he may believe that, at the time of Jesus, men were possessed of devils, believes that they ever have been in any other instance, either before or since.","Men's moral principles are weak enough without their being made subordinate to selfishness; and their selfishness is quite active enough, without any such effort as Christianity makes to constitute it the mainspring of all their conduct.","All know the importance of sustaining the hopes of a sick man. The reason of this is that his nervous system is then, vastly more than in health, susceptible to the influence of particular states of the mind.","If the jury have no right to judge of the justice of a law of the government, they plainly can do nothing to protect the people against the oppressions of the government; for there are no oppressions which the government may not authorize by law.","The only security men can have for their political liberty, consists in keeping their money in their own pockets.","That no government, so called, can reasonably be trusted, or reasonably be supposed to have honest purposes in view, any longer than it depends wholly upon voluntary support.","Any rule, not existing in the nature of things, or that is not permanent, universal and inflexible in its application, is no law, according to any correct definition of the term law.","Slavery, if it can be legalized at all, can be legalized only by positive legislation. Natural law gives it no aid. Custom imparts to it no legal sanction.","It is perfectly clear, in the first place, that the constitution of the United States did not, of itself, create or establish slavery as a new institution; or even give any authority to the state governments to establish it as a new institution. The greatest sticklers for slavery do not claim this.","A slave government is an oligarchy; and one, too, of the most arbitrary and criminal character.","Slavery is a wrong to each individual enslaved; and not merely to the first of a series. Natural law, therefore, as much forbids the enslaving of the child, as if the wrong of enslaving the parent had never been perpetrated.","Any government, that is its own judge of, and determines authoritatively for the people, what are its own powers over the people, is an absolute government of course. It has all the powers that it chooses to exercise. There is no other or at least no more accurate definition of a despotism than this.","The right of revolution, which tyrants, in mockery, accord to mankind, is no legal right under a government; it is only a natural right to overturn a government.","All, or nearly all, the advantage there is in fixing any constitutional limits to the power of a government, is simply to give notice to the government of the point at which it will meet with resistance.","All legitimate government is a mutual insurance company, voluntarily agreed upon by the parties to it, for the protection of their rights against wrong-doers. In its voluntary character it is precisely similar to an association for mutual protection against fire or shipwreck.","When a man says he is building a house for himself and his posterity, he does not mean to be understood as saying that he has any thought of binding them, nor is it to be inferred that he is so foolish as to imagine that he has any right or power to bind them, to live in it.","It cannot be said that the Constitution formed 'the people of the United States,' for all time, into a corporation. It does not speak of 'the people' as a corporation, but as individuals. A corporation does not describe itself as 'we,' nor as 'people,' nor as 'ourselves.' Nor does a corporation, in legal language, have any 'posterity.'","The right of absolute and irresponsible dominion is the right of property, and the right of property is the right of absolute, irresponsible dominion. The two are identical; the one necessarily implying the other.","The secret ballot makes a secret government; and a secret government is a secret band of robbers and murderers.","The single despot stands out in the face of all men, and says: I am the State: My will is law: I am your master: I take the responsibility of my acts: The only arbiter I acknowledge is the sword: If any one denies my right, let him try conclusions with me.","What is the motive to the secret ballot? This, and only this: Like other confederates in crime, those who use it are not friends, but enemies; and they are afraid to be known, and to have their individual doings known, even to each other.","It is self-evident that no number of men, by conspiring, and calling themselves a government, can acquire any rights whatever over other men, or other men's property, which they had not before, as individuals.","Legally speaking, there are no such things as 'public rights,' as distinguished from individual rights. Legally speaking, there is no such creature or thing as 'the public.'","Who are ever taxed? Individuals only. Who have property that can be taxed? Individuals only. Who can give their consent to be taxed? Individuals only. Who are ever taxed without their consent? Individuals only. Who, then, are robbed, if taxed without their consent? Individuals only.","The mental capacity of a person to make reasonable contracts, is the only criterion, by which to determine his legal capacity to make obligatory contracts. And his mental capacity to make reasonable contracts is certainly not to be determined by the fact that he is, or is not, twenty-one years of age.","A married woman has the same natural right to acquire and hold property, and to make all contracts that she is mentally competent to make reasonably, as has a married man, or any other man.","A man's 'original and natural right' to make all contracts that are 'intrinsically obligatory,' and to coerce the fulfillment of them, is one of the most valuable and indispensable of all human possessions.","It is with government paper, and bank paper, as it is with the paper of private persons; that is, it is worth just what can be delivered in redemption of it, and no more. We all understand that the notes of the Astors, and Stewarts, and Vanderbilts, though issued by millions, and tens of millions, are really worth their nominal values.","In reality there is no such thing as an inflation of prices, relatively to gold. There is such a thing as a depreciated paper currency.","To measure prices by a currency that is called by the same names as gold, but that is really inferior in value to gold, and then - because those prices are nominally higher than gold prices - to say that they are inflated, relatively to gold, is a perfect absurdity.","Practically and commercially speaking, a dollar is not necessarily a specific thing, made of silver, or gold, or any other single metal, or substance. It is only such a quantum of market value as exists in a given piece of silver or gold.","A man who is without capital, and who, by prohibitions upon banking, is practically forbidden to hire any, is in a condition elevated but one degree above that of a chattel slave. He may live; but he can live only as the servant of others; compelled to perform such labor, and to perform it at such prices, as they may see fit to dictate.","To deprive mankind of their natural right and power of creating wealth for themselves, is as great a tyranny as it is to rob them of it after they have created it. And this is done by all laws against honest banking.","If it be said that the consent of the strongest party in a nation, is all that is necessary to justify the establishment of a government that shall have authority over the weaker party, it may be answered that the most despotic governments in the world rest upon that very principle, viz.: the consent of the strongest party.","Majorities, as such, afford no guarantees for justice. They are men of the same nature as minorities. They have the same passions for fame, power, and money, as minorities; and are liable and likely to be equally - perhaps more than equally, because more boldly - rapacious, tyrannical and unprincipled, if intrusted with power.","Majorities and minorities cannot rightfully be taken at all into account in deciding questions of justice.","The number who actually consented to the Constitution of the United States, at the first, was very small. Considered as the act of the whole people, the adoption of the Constitution was the merest farce and imposture, binding upon nobody.","Doubtless the most miserable of men, under the most oppressive government in the world, if allowed the ballot, would use it, if they could see any chance of thereby ameliorating their condition.","There is not, in the Constitution, a syllable that implies that persons, born within the territorial limits of the United States, have allegiance imposed upon them on account of their birth in the country, or that they will be judged by any different rule, on the subject of treason, than persons of foreign birth.","One essential of a free government is that it rest wholly on voluntary support. And one certain proof that a government is not free, is that it coerces more or less persons to support it, against their will.","All governments, the worst on earth, and the most tyrannical on earth, are free governments to that portion of the people who voluntarily support them.","The rescue of a person, who is assaulted, or restrained of his liberty, without authority of law, is not only morally, but legally, a meritorious act; for every body is under obligation to go to the assistance of one who is assailed by assassins, robbers, ravishers, kidnappers, or ruffians of any kind.","The trial by jury might safely be introduced into a despotic government, if the jury were to exercise no right of judging of the law, or the justice of the law.","The laws recognize no obligation on the part of the slave to labor for or serve his master. If he refuse to labor, the law will not interfere to compel him. The master must do his own flogging, as in the case of an ox or a horse.","The imaginations of believers have dressed up and exaggerated the excellence of the style and matter of the New Testament generally, in the same manner, in which they have the moral instructions of Jesus.","The desertion of Jesus, by his followers, furnishes an argument in support of the supposition that he attempted to be king of the Jews, rather than that he was a superior being.","Jesus never instructed men to do what was right because it was right; yet this is the true reason why they should do it.","The trial by jury is a trial by 'the country,' in contradistinction to a trial by the government. The jurors are drawn by lot from the mass of the people, for the very purpose of having all classes of minds and feelings, that prevail among the people at large, represented in the jury.","The law does not require a man to cease to be a man, and act without regard to consequences, when he becomes a juror.","Our Constitution does not profess to have been established simply by the majority, but by 'the people' - the minority as much as the majority.","A contract for the establishment of government, being nothing but a voluntary contract between individuals for their mutual benefit, differs, in nothing that is essential to its validity, from any other contract between man and man, or between nation and nation.","If physical power be the fountain of law, then law and force are synonymous terms. Or, perhaps, rather, law would be the result of a combination of will and force; of will, united with a physical power sufficient to compel obedience to it, but not necessarily having any moral character whatever.","Even if the Constitution of the United States had intended to recognize slavery, as a constitutional state institution, such intended recognition would have failed of effect, and been legally void, because slavery then had no constitutional existence to be recognized.","For a government to declare a vice to be a crime, and to punish it as such, is an attempt to falsify the very nature of things. It is as absurd as it would be to declare truth to be falsehood, or falsehood truth.","Vices are usually pleasurable, at least for the time being, and often do not disclose themselves as vices, by their effects, until after they have been practised for many years; perhaps for a lifetime.","Children learn many principles of natural law at a very early age. For example: they learn that when one child has picked up an apple or a flower, it is his, and that his associates must not take it from him against his will.","Justice is the object of government, and those who support the government, must be agreed as to the justice to be executed by it, or they cannot rightfully unite in maintaining the government itself."],"Lysette Anthony":["Mental illness leaves a huge legacy, not just for the person suffering it but for those around them.","It's lovely to be told you're wonderful by someone when you're used to being told how awful you are.","As an actress, I get plenty of drama in my professional life. When I'm at home, I want a peaceful life.","I grew up not seeing my father, and it is a hole in my heart that will never heal.","I was sent to boarding school at the age of ten. I think Mummy was trying to protect me in her own way, trying to spare me living through the day-to-day reality of her illness.","I didn't go to America to be a star, but to try to reclaim my life."],"Lytton Strachey":["The history of the Victorian Age will never be written: we know too much about it.","The genius of the French language, descended from its single Latin stock, has triumphed most in the contrary direction - in simplicity, in unity, in clarity, and in restraint.","There is something dark and wintry about the atmosphere of the later Middle Ages.","Though, with the ascendancy of Louis, the political power of the nobles finally came to an end, France remained, in the whole complexion of her social life, completely aristocratic.","Ignorance is the first requisite of the historian - ignorance, which simplifies and clarifies, which selects and omits, with a placid perfection unattainable by the highest art.","Modern as the style of Pascal's writing is, his thought is deeply impregnated with the spirit of the Middle Ages. He belonged, almost equally, to the future and to the past.","Discretion is not the better part of biography.","With a very few exceptions, every word in the French vocabulary comes straight from the Latin.","When the French nation gradually came into existence among the ruins of the Roman civilization in Gaul, a new language was at the same time slowly evolved.","When Louis XIV assumed the reins of government France suddenly and wonderfully came to her maturity; it was as if the whole nation had burst into splendid flower.","Unlike the majority of the writers of his age, La Rochefoucauld was an aristocrat; and this fact gives a peculiar tone to his work.","The stability and peace which seemed to be so firmly established by the brilliant monarchy of Francis I vanished with the terrible outbreak of the Wars of Religion.","The old interests of aristocracy - the romance of action, the exalted passions of chivalry and war - faded into the background, and their place was taken by the refined and intimate pursuits of peace and civilization.","The amateur is very rare in French literature - as rare as he is common in our own.","In the literature of France Moliere occupies the same kind of position as Cervantes in that of Spain, Dante in that of Italy, and Shakespeare in that of England. His glory is more than national - it is universal.","In sheer genius Pascal ranks among the very greatest writers who have lived upon this earth. And his genius was not simply artistic; it displayed itself no less in his character and in the quality of his thought.","In pure literature, the writers of the eighteenth century achieved, indeed, many triumphs; but their great, their peculiar, triumphs were in the domain of thought.","How far the existence of the Academy has influenced French literature, either for good or for evil, is an extremely dubious question.","Englishmen have always loved Moliere.","English dramatic literature is, of course, dominated by Shakespeare; and it is almost inevitable that an English reader should measure the value of other poetic drama by the standards which Shakespeare has already implanted in his mind.","During this earlier period of his activity Voltaire seems to have been trying - half unconsciously, perhaps - to discover and to express the fundamental quality of his genius.","But Racine's extraordinary powers as a writer become still more obvious when we consider that besides being a great poet he is also a great psychologist."]}
