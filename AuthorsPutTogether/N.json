{"N. K. Jemisin":["Reconciliation is a part of the healing process, but how can there be healing when the wounds are still being inflicted?","This is magic we're talking about. It's supposed to go places science can't, defy logic, wink at technology, fill us all with the sensawunda that comes of gazing upon a fictional world and seeing something truly different from our own.","I think most fiction focuses on uncomfortable settings because that's interesting.","In the 'Dreamblood' books, I'm focusing more on what I like about epic fantasy: the layering and depth of tension; the chance to really delve into the minutia of an alternate society and its politics; a large cast of characters to love and hate.","It's the way the human brain works: when enough events occur in a pattern, we stop thinking and go into macro mode.","It's human nature that we come in our own flavours, and it doesn't make any sense to write a monochromatic or monocultural story unless you're doing something extremely small - a locked room-style story.","As a black woman, I have no particular interest in maintaining the status quo. Why would I? The status quo is harmful; the status quo is significantly racist and sexist and a whole bunch of other things that I think need to change.","With epic fantasy, there is a tendency for it to be quintessentially conservative in that its job is to restore what is perceived to be out of whack.","I don't really understand why so many fantasy writers choose to focus on worlds that just seem strangely denuded. But to them, I guess it doesn't seem strange. And I guess that's their privilege. It isn't mine.","Reconciliations are for after the violence has ended.","Within the sphere of steampunk, there seems to be a rapidly growing subsphere of gadgetless 'neo-Victorian' novels, most of which attempt to recapture the romance of the era without all the sociopolitical ugliness.","Actual Victorian mores and politics were a reaction to a specific series of historical events, technological and scientific developments, and ethical trends in which the commodification of people was de rigueur.","Magic is the mysteries into which not everyone is so lucky, or unlucky, as to be initiated. It can be affected by belief, the whims of the unseen, harsh language. And it is not. Supposed. To make. Sense. In fact, I think it's coolest when it doesn't.","It's hard out here for a fantasy writer, after all; there's all these 'rules' I'm supposed to follow, or the Fantasy Police might come and make me do hard labor in the Cold Iron Mines.","A fantasy novel set in something other than medieval Europe, featuring an almost entirely black cast, is considered risky.","To some degree, as I move outside of the exclusive genre audience, the exclusive genre issues don't bother me as much. Maybe that's just speculation.","Reactionary movements can't sustain themselves unless they find something new to catch and burn on.","I write what feels real. I write things that are informed both by my own experience and by actual history.","I read a lot of history for fun.","I've always believed that as an artist, as a writer, you need a lot of contact with other people to make your art good.","Fantasy is fantasy. It's fiction. It's not meant to be a textbook. I don't believe in letting research overwhelm the fiction. That's a danger of science fiction in particular, as opposed to fantasy. A lot of writers forget that what they're doing is supposed to be art.","I tend to like writing characters that are not typical heroes.","I am a linear thinker in a lot of ways.","I tend to write society as I see and understand it.","My first series, the 'Inheritance' trilogy, in the first book, you were dealing with a woman of color from an impoverished culture, being brought up among wealthy, privileged white people and having to cope and perform in ways that she has not been raised to do, and that was obviously drawn from some personal experiences.","There's a tendency in American thought - maybe elsewhere, but that's the culture I know best - to default to social Darwinism, even though even Darwin noted that's a misapplication of his ideas.","When I start a new novel, I often write 'test chapters' in different tenses and from different points of view in order to figure out which is best to tell the tale.","I write for myself - but it is nice when other people like it, too!","I would love to just write and not have everything I say or do turn into a political battle.","I was raised to be very wary of the police. I was raised to stay away from them unless you absolutely have to. Because they're dangerous.","Readers seem to really like the fact that what I'm writing is not traditional fantasy.","Knowing about authors' beliefs helps you understand how those beliefs influence their writing, and things you thought meant one thing, once you've got enough information about that writer, you suddenly realize mean an entirely different thing. That makes a difference.","I think the people who believe that works can and always should be divorced from the context are people who have the privilege to do so.","If you can imagine something, it will be.","There's a thriving field of self-published stuff in, particularly, black fiction. I don't know that other groups of people of color have that same recourse.","All people who grew up with science fiction and fantasy and horror went through the whole acculturation process of the genre. We were all told to read the golden age writers. We were all told Heinlein and Asimov and all these straight, white males, although some of them were Jewish.","It takes practice to do anything unique within this field, period, in writing, practice doing anything unique in writing.","Any writer kind of who knows what they're doing goes forth and grabs a copy of an issue of something that they want to be published in, or they skim it online. They read what that market has been doing. They see a particular flavor of fiction.","I've been very happy with Orbit and am thrilled that they're giving me more chances to explore my creative visions."],"N. Murray Edwards":["Anybody can do a deal. The tough part is doing the deal at the right time, being strategic.","All of us are going to have to find ways to do things more efficiently, find ways to get our costs more in line, and do it in a time of higher regulatory and environmental standards.","I've been called Mr. Patient Money because I have the patience to work through challenging circumstances.","Having companies like PotashCorp based in Saskatoon or Cameco based in Saskatoon that have worldwide presence but have the head office jobs, the head office managers and head office employees in your local economy are important from a job creation and wealth creation point of view.","I think, if you create the right economic framework in terms of government policy, that Saskatchewan can continue to succeed and grow. Instead of having people migrate from Saskatchewan, they will be migrating to Saskatchewan.","On a given day, you can have market fluctuations where prices fluctuate far more than the underlying economic value of the unit.","It's more important to fly midpoint in deals and work together than to try to haggle for the last dollar.","From a Canadian partisan perspective, the more we can upgrade bitumen in Canada, the more we can create jobs in value added, in tax revenues for all Canadians."],"N. R. Narayana Murthy":["Growth is painful. Change is painful. But, nothing is as painful as staying stuck where you do not belong.","Entrepreneurship is all about an idea that creates differentiated business value to one's customers. You must be able to convince your customers about the benefits that association with you or your products will give them. People are ready to pay if they are convinced about your services or products.","Leadership is about doing the right thing, even if it going against a vast number of naysayers and mediocre people.","Nobody is bothered about an institution more than its alumni.","When you run a part of the relay and pass on the baton, there is no sense of unfinished business in your mind. There is just the sense of having done your part to the best of your ability. That is it. The hope is to pass on the baton to somebody who will run faster and run a better marathon.","If England became a world power, it was because of the industrial revolution.","We all, as engineers, doctors, have a big responsibility to bring smiles on the faces of suffering humanity.","A great leader also has the ability to make people an inch taller in his presence.","Engineering or technology is all about using the power of science to make life better for people, to reduce cost, to improve comfort, to improve productivity, etc.","Effective use of technology is important to deliver healthcare. By leveraging technology, you can bring down lack of access and cost of healthcare.","Infosys is an absolute meritocracy. Even in a meritocracy, other things being equal, you have to give opportunity to the more experienced candidate.","When you are in business for a long time, you go through good times and bad times. When you go through bad times, you learn to control costs, satisfy customers better, satisfy employees better and become more transparent. Therefore, you build character in the company.","I have always looked at my competencies before accepting any responsibility.","I want Infosys to be a company which is globally respected and in where people belonging to different nationalities, races and religious beliefs will work with intense competition but utmost courtesy, dignity and co-operation in adding greater value to our stakeholders day after day.","Infosys demonstrated to the world that an Indian company could implement standards of quality, operations, finance that compare with the best. That is a legacy I am happy with.","It's very important to learn quick lessons from your failures, very important to recognize symptoms of failure pretty early, and it is very, very important to not to be attached too much to the idea - you have to know when to give up an idea.","You need to mesh the voices of people with expertise and meritocracy.","I do not believe in any legacy. The past is dead and gone.","Hinduism has an enormous capacity to absorb from outside influences and accept it in a peaceful and steady manner without perturbing the system.","I've always enjoyed mathematics. It is the most precise and concise way of expressing any idea.","Leading by example is the most powerful advice you can give to anybody.","In order to improve healthcare, we'll have to spend more on it, increase accountability and decentralize services, enforce standards and reinstate people's faith in it.","The future of any corporation is as good as the value system of the leaders and followers in the organization.","I have known Mr. Kumar Mangalam Birla for a long time. He is a good man. He is a decent man.","Although we have enough healthcare support, often it doesn't reach the poor and needy. In this scenario, technology is the best solution.","If my company spends money, it should be disclosed to the shareholders and how it was spent. With my personal money, I can do anything I want. But company money should be disclosed.","The lack of financial strength to avail healthcare is a major challenge.","All developmental activities for the common man such as education, healthcare, shelter and food distribution should be handled by reputed private sector institutions. It should be a competitive market in order to prevent the formation of monopolies.","The principle of democracy is all about delegation of power by the vast majority of citizens through a few chosen representatives chosen on merit and competence.","Entrepreneurship is all about deferred gratification.","My passion is to create a better society for our future citizens.","Mahatma Gandhi was someone who demonstrated the tremendous power of leadership by example.","If longevity is the best index to measure a company, a basic requirement is the ability of the corporation to generate new and new leaders.","The biggest impediment to growth is in our minds and not in the world outside, and only constant in the world is change.","Any mechanism that will ensure benefits to consumer, any mechanism that will ensure that we do not waste food grains, any mechanism that helps the poorest of the poor is a welcome step.","I am a man in a hurry.","Often times I have been asked about the attributes for success, and I have said that you need two attributes for succeeding as an entrepreneur: one, courage, second, luck.","Investment in training is a huge necessity for knowledge-based corporations.","If the U.S. became the undisputed superpower that it is today, it was primarily because of its technology, whether it is in transportation, agriculture, high-tech industry, medicine, etc.","I think, my own personal view is there should be higher and higher levels of autonomy; government should not interfere in setting up colleges, in running colleges. The market, the society will decide which is a good university, which is not a good university, rather than government mandating.","I think, at the end of the day, you have to reduce friction to businesses, ideally to zero, so that more and more entrepreneurs can create more and more jobs with higher and higher disposable income.","I think India has several advantages in the knowledge sector, in the software sector.","I think every country has to recognize its competitive advantage and liberate its strengths to be a partner in global trade, and that's the only way you can survive and succeed.","Every company has to identify what I call its strategic resources, and make sure that it grabs as much of its strategic resources as possible.","It's well proved economics that if a country which is rich and a country that is poor come together in global trade, sooner or later the standard of living of the poor country will go up towards that of the rich country.","Even if a company is taken private, at some stage people want to make it public.","Science is about unravelling nature.","Rahul Gandhi is very idealistic and a very decent human being. He has real concerns for the downtrodden.","Kumar Mangalam Birla is one of the most respected business persons.","My personal view is that organisations have a capacity to throw up extraordinary leaders to suit the occasion.","Today, the biggest bottleneck to the growth of a corporation is availability of good talent.","Clearly, healthcare is a very important sector.","When people get rich, they cut themselves off from the context that has earned them these riches - the context of the common men. They forget they are part of society.","I think people like Bill Gates, who have given away enormous sums of money, are shining examples for all of us to follow.","I am what we call a 'karma yogi' in Sanskrit. A karma yogi is somebody who believes in data. I collect a lot of data.","I have always focused on the bottom line.","I have no desire to enter politics. Because I am not suited for that.","I was the first businessman to say, 'You should give tax benefit to only small companies. You should say your profits are exempt to a limit of Rs. 50 crore or so, but beyond that, you should pay taxes.' I have been arguing with successive finance ministers on this.","A professorship appeals very much because I enjoy being with younger people.","I think there are opportunities outside India as well as in India. In fact, some of the largest projects that most Indian software companies are doing are in India.","The primary difference that I have found between the system of education in India and other countries, particularly the U.S., is that they focus on problem solving and relating theories to reality around them. These two things are lacking in the education system in India.","Indian IT corporations have made work in the U.S. much more efficient by enhancing their productivity and quality of work. We have helped to add sufficient value to the corporations in the U.S.","We are not the same India that the world saw in the 1970s and '80s. Hence, we have a responsibility to live up to the pedestal on which we have been put.","The unique instrument to eradicate poverty and usher in prosperity is our youth.","Even the most dishonest officer would want to be seen as a role model for his children.","To me, patriotism is about working ethically and wholeheartedly in our chosen field.","The world expects India to be one of the leaders in solving the problems of politics and economics. India sits at the high table in most major multilateral deliberations. What India says is heard with attention and seriousness.","India is known for much development that has happened since our independence, but at the same time, we have also failed on many levels. It is the responsibility of the future generation to ensure that all these failures are corrected and help create a civilised society with equal opportunities for one and all.","I believe all universities should at least offer courses in politics and policy implementation.","It is a well-known fact that bringing in technologies in retail sector is good for consumers.","India needs to sustain its high growth rate."],"N. Robert Hammer":["The good thing about execution issues are that they are within our control.","One of my major objectives is to build a long-term enterprise, to build shareholder value over time.","We have innovative differentiated technology that is recognized by our customers and third party analysts as the best in the industry; we have industry-leading support with a very large satisfied installed base due to our best-in-class support and development organisations.","Product pricing is aligned to the way customers want to acquire their solutions and are delivered via different delivery models including appliances, the cloud, or as on-premise software solutions.","I have either run private equity funded companies or been a partner in a private equity fund since 1982. I've had a front row view of the vital role private equity continues to play in building and keeping American businesses competitive in the global economy.","Private equity helps produce strong companies, promotes innovation and spurs job growth.","Private equity funds a substantial amount of new businesses and is the source of capital to rejuvenate failing businesses, which are major drivers of job growth in this economy.","There is no denying that downsizing can happen when a company receives private equity funding. It is unfortunate and hard on everyone who is affected."],"N. Scott Momaday":["Indians are marvelous storytellers. In some ways, that oral tradition is stronger than the written tradition.","I am interested in the way that we look at a given landscape and take possession of it in our blood and brain. None of us lives apart from the land entirely; such an isolation is unimaginable.","The spiritual reality of the Indian world is very evident, very highly developed. I think it affects the life of every Indian person in one way or another.","I have a pretty good knowledge of the Indian world by virtue of living on several different reservations and being exposed to several different cultures and languages.","I am a member of the Kiowa Gourd Dance Society; I visit sacred places such as Devil's Tower and the Medicine Wheel. These places are important to me, because they've been made sacred by sacrifice, by the investment of blood and experience and story.","As far as I am concerned, poetry is a statement concerning the human condition, composed in verse.","My father was a painter and he taught art. He once said to me, 'I never knew an Indian child who could not draw.'","I have deep roots in this Oklahoma soil. It makes me proud.","Writing is not a matter of choice. Writers have to write. It is somehow in their temperament, in the blood, in tradition.","Sometimes, I think the best kind of poem is one in which there is an acute balance between what is humorous and that which is very serious. That balance is very hard to strike. But it can be done."],"N. T. Rama Rao, Jr.":["I love being called NTR's grandson. I never moved away from his shadow, maybe because I didn't try enough or maybe because I like it this way.","I don't want to waste my energy in other things; instead, I would put all that in reaching the next level in a craft that I love the most.","I believe in doing what I am best at.","I am a very shy person who is just close to himself. So I would refrain from talking about my personal life."],"N. T. Wright":["You can't reconcile being pro-life on abortion and pro-death on the death penalty.","Love is not just tolerance. It's not just distant appreciation. It's a warm sense of, 'I am enjoying the fact that you are you.'","To get overprotective about particular readings of the Bible is always in danger of idolatry.","People have been told so often that resurrection is just a metaphor, and means Jesus died and was glorified - in other words, he went to Heaven, whatever that means. And they've never realized that the word 'resurrection' simply didn't mean that.","Far too many people, especially within evangelicalism, think that the individual is all that matters, and that the corporate dimension is a distraction or diversion. Of course Christianity is deeply personal for every single Christian; nobody gets lost in the kingdom of God. But you can't play that off against the corporate dimension.","While some who downplay Christ's divinity have imagined Jesus as a great social worker 'being kind to old ladies, small dogs and little children,' orthodox Christianity has not wanted Jesus to have a political message.","I'm not a universalist, and the way I talk about final loss is this: People worship idols - money, whatever. Their humanness gets reshaped around the idol - you become like what you worship. That's one of the basic spiritual laws.","I work in a very tough area of Britain. There is not much hope sociologically where I live and work, they're all sorts of conditions of poverty and deprivation and so on, I really do believe that the message of the kingdom of God is for places like this.","The Bible is the book of my life. It's the book I live with, the book I live by, the book I want to die by.","The whole point of the kingdom of God is Jesus has come to bear witness to the true truth, which is nonviolent. When God wants to take charge of the world, he doesn't send in the tanks. He sends in the poor and the meek.","Heard in full sound, the Gospels tell about the establishment of a theocracy, and portray what theocracy looks like with Jesus as king.","The imminent demise of the church has been predicted since the middle of the 18th century. This is the regular secular mantra if churchgoing declines. I could take you to plenty of churches that are full to bursting and new churches being built.","From where many of us in the U.K. sit, American politics is hopelessly polarized. All kinds of issues get bundled up into two great heaps. The rest of the world, today and across the centuries, simply doesn't see things in this horribly oversimplified way.","Most of the things that really matter require faith. 'How do I know that my wife loves me?' 'How do I know that Mozart's 'Jupiter Symphony' is sublime and beautiful?' There are all sorts of things which come at a more lowly level than that - 'How do I know that two plus two equals four?' There are different layers, different types of knowing.","The question of Heaven, the question of what happens after death, is one which a lot of people in our culture try to put off as long as they can, but sooner or later it suddenly swings round and looks them in the eye.","Within orthodoxy, there is always a danger of faith collapsing into fear.","I didn't write much until I turned 40. Up until then I felt constrained by a sense of the discipline of New Testament studies and a sense of the ruling elite in theology and biblical studies.","I think future generations will say the late 20th century and the early 21st century was a time of great convulsions and upheavals.","It's very easy for a church just to slide along from week to week, taking it for granted that we do our services like this and that, and we celebrate the sacraments like this and that.","Almost all the early Christian Fathers were opposed to the death penalty, even though it was of course standard practice across the ancient world.","Of course there are people who think of 'heaven' as a kind of pie-in-the-sky dream of an afterlife to make the thought of dying less awful. No doubt that's a problem as old as the human race.","Western Christians have imagined that, at the end of the day, God is going to throw the present space-time universe into a trashcan and we'll be sitting on clouds playing harps. The ultimate future that we're promised is much more interesting than that. It's new heavens and a new Earth with new bodies to live in.","One of the things I find depressing about some of the upper echelons of Anglicanism on both sides of the Atlantic is that it's sort of taken for granted that we all basically know what's in the Bible, and so we just glance at a few verses for devotional purposes and then get on to the real business.","Death is a monster; death is horrible.","A 'conservative believer' must be someone who believes that Jesus was truly human as well as truly divine."],"Nacho Figueras":["I always say that polo, for you to pursue a career, mainly any sport, you have to be born in the right place. If you're born in Hawaii, you surf. If you're born in Austria, you probably will ski. If you're born in Argentina, you most likely ride horses and have a chance to play polo.","Polo is the most inviting sport I've ever seen.","Polo is a great thing to do with your kids and your family - it is a great day out. And to me, horses are amazing creatures that give you this cable to Earth and put you in contact with nature.","I think the concept of polo that people had in the 1920s and the 1930s was much more accurate, when going to a polo match was seen as a great day out and great fun on a more popular level.","When I go to the gym, stretching is very important. For polo, you don't need too much strength so you don't want to build yourself up too much. It's all about flexibility.","When I was 14, I decided that I really wanted to pursue polo more, so I asked my parents if it would be okay for me to go live on a farm outside the city so I could play.","There are many guys out there who look like me - you know, brunettes with long hair. There are thousands. But I think the difference is that I am a real polo player, who does endorsements for Ralph Lauren on the side, and I've always looked at it that way.","I do believe that using fragrance is a plus. It's one of our senses and it's be a waste not to use our sense of smell. I also think smell is something that tells a lot about a person.","My real passions are horses and playing polo. I care a lot about that and staying fit and in shape.","I was born in Argentina where polo is popular, and my father always loved horses, so he encouraged me to play. He's the main reason I started to play polo and get involved with the sport."],"Nadar":["The portrait I do best is of the person I know best."],"Nader al-Masri":["I feel a freedom when I start running. If I don't train, I feel like everyone else in the Gaza Strip.","I don't have proper places to run.","If there's an incursion I don't go out of the house.","I have a coach but there's nobody at my level in Gaza. I have to do most of my training sessions on my own.","I am very optimistic, and I wish that God almighty grants me success to get a qualifying time. Only then can I go to the Olympics. If this happens I will be the first Palestinian athlete to gain a qualifying time. This will be a big achievement.","I practice on the roads of Gaza as we don't have good stadiums and tracks so I gave my best.","If the Palestinian Olympic Committee or Palestinian Federation provide good facilities to the athletes then maybe I can become better than these Bahraini or Qatari athletes."],"Nadezhda Tolokonnikova":["It is possible to tolerate anything as long as it only affects you. But the method of collective punishment is bigger than that.","Modern capitalism seeks to assure us that it operates according to the principles of free creativity, endless development and diversity. It glosses over its other side in order to hide the reality that millions of people are enslaved by an all-powerful and fantastically stable norm of production. We want to reveal this lie.","The words we spoke and our entire punk performance aimed to express our disapproval of a specific political event: the patriarchs' support of Vladimir Putin, who has taken an authoritarian and anti-feminist course.","I will not remain silent, resigned to watch as my fellow prisoners collapse under the strain of slavery-like conditions.","In May 2013, my lawyer Dmitry Dinze filed a complaint about the conditions at PC-14 with the prosecutor's office. The deputy head of the colony, Lieutenant Colonel Kupriyanov, instantly made conditions at the camp unbearable.","Mordovian prisoners are afraid of their own shadows. They are completely terrified.","We are the rebels asking for the storm, and believing that truth is only to be found in an endless search. If the 'World Spirit' touches you, do not expect that it will be painless.","As a child, I wanted to go into advertising. I had a love affair with the advertising industry."],"Nadia Ali":["I think being an Asian woman has been more of an advantage than a disadvantage. It helps me stand out from the rest of the entertainers out there. Again, being from such an ethnically diverse place like New York, you get comfortable and confident with being different!","I love the Middle East and have been lucky enough to visit a few of the countries like Egypt, Lebanon, Jordon and the U.A.E.","Personal relationships are usually my biggest inspirations for writing my songs. The best way for me to write a song is to visualise the story in my head, and I start humming a melody, and before you know it, a song is born.","As a person, I believe that I am sensitive, which helped me be the artist I am.","I am definitely a spiritually centered person and that is usually one of my biggest guiding lights beyond music.","The advice I would give to girls from Eastern backgrounds who are interested in the arts is that it is always beneficial to get your academic studies out of the way before going into the competitive world of the arts.","Since I was a child, I always loved music that made me want to dance. As a teenager, I used to dance the night away to electronic music.","I believe the most attractive thing about a guy is his personality and the way he views the world. I'm not into bad boys. I like the sweet sometimes even shy guys.","I love Chicago. It's one of my favorite cities, hands down.","I think I've always wanted to be different from everybody else. I get really annoyed when I do something and everybody else does it too, or if I'm doing something that everybody else is doing.","I love music in general. It's like girls and their clothes and shoes; when you love shoes, you love shoes. So, for me, I think it's a really dangerous thing to say I'm going to write the best dance song in the world.","I write my songs many times to chord progressions on a piano. Unfortunately, I can't keep playing the piano, so I just record it into the software."],"Nadia Bjorlin":["I would love to play 'Wonder Woman'; I have the abilities and the strength because I am definitely not the typical Hollywood actress.","My family understands the pain of struggling with a loved one who's suffering from a blood-related cancer, and we seek to support those who are working to find a cure.","Showbiz can be cruel.","Most actors don't grow up with sweet, vanilla parents.","I believe in 'soulmates,' especially growing up and seeing how much my parents loved each other. They always said that they had been married in past lives, too.","My father's music has always inspired me in many ways... especially to be better at what I do.","You try not to become so emotionally attached to your character, but you do."],"Nadia Boulanger":["A great work is made out of a combination of obedience and liberty.","Loving a child doesn't mean giving in to all his whims; to love him is to bring out the best in him, to teach him to love what is difficult.","The essential conditions of everything you do must be choice, love, passion.","Life is denied by lack of attention, whether it be to cleaning windows or trying to write a masterpiece.","I've been a woman for a little over 50 years and have gotten over my initial astonishment. As for conducting an orchestra, that's a job where I don't think sex plays much part.","Do not take up music unless you would rather die than not do so.","Everything we know by heart enriches us and helps us find ourselves. If it should get in the way of finding ourselves, it is because we have no personality."],"Nadia Comaneci":["What makes me happy is the appreciation of people around me.","I have a classic taste with a twist, because classic never goes away.","Enjoy the journey and try to get better every day. And don't lose the passion and the love for what you do.","I wanted to have a free life.","You should also appreciate the goodness around you, and surround yourself with positive people.","Hard work has made it easy. That is my secret. That is why I win.","You can't jump from little things to big things. It just takes time and patience.","Maybe that's why I like gymnastics - because I like to fly.","I live in the moment. I can turn the page and move on.","Life is not easy for anyone. You have to have ups and downs. You can make mistakes. You learn and try not to make them again. That's pretty much my principle.","I know my life story sounds too extraordinary to be true.","People ask me what the definition of perfection, I said it's none: there is no definition of perfection.","I'm very good friends with my former coaches. We speak on the phone a lot.","One of the most difficult times in my life was when I escaped from Romania in November of 1989.","I don't run away from a challenge because I am afraid. Instead, I run toward it because the only way to escape fear is to trample it beneath your feet.","I thought I was going to retire at 20, and I was going to be a surgeon.","It's very hard to get to the top. It's hardest to stay at the top.","Gymnastics was my way to travelling the world.","I believe that you should gravitate to people who are doing productive and positive things with their lives.","As an Olympic champion gymnast, I have always stayed involved in my sport.","Every generation comes with a unique athlete, I don't think anybody wants to be the next Nadia; they want to be themselves.","I think that when you are on a four-inch balance beam, you don't care about laughing or smiling or waving to the crowd because you're going to be down in a second.","I had more pressure when I competed in Moscow. I had no pressure in Montreal because I only went to do my routines and hoping I didn't mess it up when I was on the bar. When I came back, 10,000 people were at the airport and I thought, 'Why?' because, in my mind, I hadn't done anything different from what I used to do in my gym.","I had a lot of energy, and my mom decided to look for a place where I can spend the energy, because I was jumping on the couch and furniture, and I was jumping on the top of the things in the house.","Ceausescu thought I had only a few medals, but I have a room full of them in Bucharest, between 150-200 in all. They needed suitcases to haul them out.","It's like someone important is missing from a party because you can't imagine an Olympic gymnastics competition without Romania.","I like to tell young people to work hard for your goals and live in the moment.","My parents were very loving, but disciplinarians.","I have had a few turning points, the first day I entered a gymnastics school at age 6.","My marriage to my husband, Bart Conner in 1996 is my proudest personal moment.","Of course, most people remember that I received the first perfect 10 in Olympic gymnastics competition.","I ended up in the US for a month or so, before moving to Montreal with some Romanian friends.","I worked hard in gymnastics since the time I was six years old until I retired at 23 years of age.","Of course, I grew up in Communist Romania, but I am happy to say that now our country is democratic, and prospering, since the revolution in 1989.","We are not coaching on a daily basis because we often travel with our charity and commercial interests.","It was good to be a kid because I did not realise all the things that came with the success. Going to the Games, I was asked what I expected to do.","I hoped to win a medal and hoped it would be gold. I knew I was good but didn't know I would be the one to score something that had never been done before.","Everything I do today is because of what I did when I was 14.","We developed a system in Romania that was very successfully continued for a number of years, but I don't know if it was because of some conflict in the organisation or whether there was government interference... but somehow, they have forgotten the importance of raising gymnasts to be ready for every Olympics.","Uchimura is the greatest of all time.","I was a perfectionist in gymnastics.","I always say, 'When the Olympics are happening, you shouldn't be in any other place in the planet - you should be here.'","Other kids had more talent, but I was the most focused.","I remember everything from 1976. I remember I was 14, and I remember my routines.","I remember before the Olympics, I was asked, 'What do you think you're going to do in the Olympics?' and I said, 'I'm hoping I'm going to win a medal, and, if possible, it's going to be a gold one.'","At 14, you think you compete, you retire and you get a job. I didn't think gymnastics was a career that was going to change my life.","I didn't know I wanted to be a gymnast; I was just introduced to the gym. I loved the place because it looked like a hi-tech playground with mats and a lot of things I can hang from.","At some particular time, when I was 14 years old, I've done something that people didn't expect.","People think you have pressure when you are young. It's the other way round, actually.","Gymnastics should be popular everywhere; you just need the right person to start the right programme.","I am not a perfect 10 anymore. I can only try my best.","Scoring the first 10 in history was a big deal, but the fact that even an electronic scoreboard could not figure out how to put out a score, it made the story more historic.","We only had white socks in Romania. But when I used to come back from the States, I used to bring back pink and yellow socks with all kind of designs, and hair clips and elastic bands for the ponytail that had colourful designs.","We used to exchange leotards with gymnasts from other countries. I don't remember who I got my most prized leotard from, but it was one with a lot of stars on it.","Yes, gymnasts aim for perfection, but I never thought about the score. If that's what's in your mind, it will probably mess you up.","In Montreal, I kept thinking, 'Pay attention: this is the Olympics! It only happens once every four years!'","Romania doesn't have a big tradition of gymnastics as a fun activity. We were a little behind in this aspect.","I like seeing advanced acrobatics, but I also like to see more than tumbling. It's important to combine the artistry of gymnastics with the tough skills. It's called artistic gymnastics. We should stand by the name.","Of course I used to smile and laugh in 1976, but not when I was competing. Please show me somebody who laughs when they are concentrating; I always smiled.","I am very highly appreciated in my country, and everybody seems to love me.","I like America. I don't want to hurt America.","I like risky stuff.","To me, family is what is important. If you don't have it, nothing is going to matter.","When I was 14, I had no pressure. I was a kid, and I didn't understand all the attention.","If I have a feeling of not trusting, I don't get too close.","The - I don't want to say older, but the more experienced I get, I treasure and I honor what I've done much more.","People always accused me of not smiling like my rival Olga Korbut, but that was just my personality. When you're balancing on a nine-inch beam, you have to concentrate. But if you look back at the footage, I was always smiling and waving at the crowd after my performances.","It was my mother who got me involved in gymnastics, sending me to classes when I was six just to stop me doing back flips on the couch and destroying the furniture.","Two days after returning from Montreal, I was training again, and I went on to win two more golds at the 1980 Moscow Olympics.","After retiring from competition in 1981, I did exhibitions and coached.","I come from a communist country. We learned nothing of lawyers, nothing about rights.","I think a lot of people don't actually know me. They think, 'She's like this,' or, 'She's like that.' They say I have no emotions - I do, but you couldn't see them then. I had to keep them inside.","Gymnastics is so huge in the Olympics. There are a lot of fans who want to see more.","I wasn't allowed to leave Romania. That made me mad. You just want your freedom. You want your space. You want opportunity.","When I got married in Bucharest, there were 10,000 people on the street. People didn't go to work that day. It was emotional to see how people care about you. I didn't expect that.","I like Oklahoma. It's a quiet place. You can work, and nobody disturbs you.","See, when I went to the Olympics in '76, the gymnastics people knew that I was good, but everybody else, after I won, everybody was like, 'Where's she coming from? Who is she? What is Romania?'","I made the cover of 'Sports Illustrated,' 'Newsweek' and 'Time' all in one week, and I didn't even know what that meant.","In the '80 Olympics... people expected me to win. I was good enough to win, and I made a mistake and ended up second, which is pretty good, too.","When you're growing up, you realize you've got a lot of heavy things on your shoulders.","Now, I have a kid, I have businesses to take care of, I have to travel. I have to sit down... and find a little time for me.","My message to the ladies would be, you can do all of the things, but not all of them at the same time.","I work out every day, but my idea is to make something short. I work out a maximum half hour. I only do like 20 minutes of cardio, and I do some stretching and some light weights, and I'm out of there.","I'm not a dreamer for, you know, 'I want to go to the moon someday.' I accomplished something when I was young, which was much more than I expected to. My results were much bigger than I ever dreamed about it.","People assume a lot of things about gymnasts - that the girls work too hard, it's way too much for them, they are too young to work so hard.","I never personally complained; everybody else complained for me.","When I look back, I am happy that my mum took me to the gymnastics club. I didn't join gymnastics to become a famous athlete or celebrity; it just happened - I did more than I expected, of course.","I basically have my life today as a result of what I did as a child. What did I miss out on? Yeah, I missed not hanging out at shopping malls, I guess, but that is not a big deal because you don't get a medal for that.","That's what everybody remembers. They don't remember how many medals I won in my career. They remember the 10s.","I would love to be in 'Dancing With the Stars.'","If I was 14 or 15 again, I would do the same thing. I've done everything. I think I've accomplished more than I had in mind.","I always say I don't want to change anything in my life.","I don't think many people consider in their heart that they have two places that are home.","I cannot change anything, so I don't want to think about what I would have done.","It feels good when you come to a place like Oklahoma to charge up the batteries. I need that.","I didn't realize that winning the Olympics at age 14 automatically put me in the category of being a celebrity.","I thought celebrity meant Hollywood, that's it. I began to see that does include Olympians. People have so much respect for Olympians.","My mother never watched me train in Romania. She wasn't allowed, it just wasn't done back then. My training was paid for by the government. My parents were not at the Olympics with me, either. I never expected them to be.","If I was a boy, nobody would care that I worked out six, seven hours a day when I was 9 years old, no? Why were people always saying 'poor little girl?' I liked to work out and always did more than I was asked to.","I couldn't do everything in the first or second day; it took me years to be able to get to the achievement that I've had. I wasn't perfect from the beginning.","At the end of the day, I just want to see good gymnastics!","I think gymnastics was associated with the 10. I thought that belonged to the sport, and somehow we gave it way.","I was turning actually 15 at the Olympics in '76... I don't think that one year makes a huge difference.","Two gold medals and two silver, I don't think is that bad... I think I still did a pretty good job.","I come from a wonderful country with wonderful people.","I never thought I would be standing here, married to an All-American guy, living in Oklahoma. What a country.","I tell people, 'Have you ever been to Oklahoma? There are a lot of nice people there that do wonderful things.'","Nellie Kim, an Olympic champion from the former Soviet Union, got a 10 right after me in '76, but nobody talks about that.","I used to tell people if they looked at a map, it was right in the middle of the United States. But now everybody knows Oklahoma because of the Thunder and their success. I don't know if I'll get 'Why?' anymore.","I'm the kind of person, I leave a little space for better.","When I went into the Montreal Games, nobody expected much out of me.","Once you become an Olympic champion, you are expected to win all the time.","What can you know about life at 14? I have learned a lot since, but you learn slowly. You get hit by many things and try to make sense of it.","I am a relaxed person. I am very happy.","When you go out of your country and meet people, you get a wider perspective.","Near the end of my career, I saw things that didn't make too much sense to me when I was a kid.","I did not even look at the scoreboard when my routine was done in 1976.","The fans had become used to looking toward the scoreboard whenever a gymnast stuck a landing. You could tell they were thinking, 'Was that good enough? Would the numbers read 10.00?' The athlete was looking, too."],"Nadia Giosia":["Exercising with a trainer makes my quality of life go through the roof.","I eat mostly vegetarian. I love meat, but I think it should be enjoyed on occasion - like cheesecake or blackouts.","People are complex. You can be smart and still look hot. You can be a punk rocker yet have a refined vocabulary. It's all about this mashup that makes us who we are and I think that's a beautiful thing.","Dinner is often a stew of beans or legumes, which are awesome for dieting; they give you that meaty satisfaction and both are excellent with whole grain rice or bread.","I grew up in a family where the women were just nuts. They didn't stand around in cardigans making polite conversation while they chopped tomatoes.","I always have a good quality extra virgin olive oil. A cheap quality oil will end up cheapening your dishes. And I love sweetening my dishes with maple syrup. It has a bit of a bitter kick at the end that works wonderfully in savory dishes.","'Shkoff' is to eat. 'Shkiaff' is to slap. Like, 'Gettouttahere I'm gonna give you a couple of shkiaffs,' or, 'Forget presentation, just shkiaff the food onto the plate.'","I was a ravenous child. I'm a ravenous adult. I love to eat.","I did skit comedy online for many years, beginning around 2001. Around 2006 I started watching a lot of food television and got re-interested in food. I come from a very food-obsessed family. But I also wanted to do my own thing, which was the comedy.","You don't have to look far to taste some of the best food the world has to offer. I'd pit my grandmother against a 3-star Michelin chef any day.","I work out four to five days a week, alternating three workouts.","I eat vegetarian a lot. I buy only fresh ingredients and cook from scratch - that way, when I feel like snacking and look in my fridge, it's: 'Oh, baby carrots or chocolate soy pudding. Take your pick.'","I'm addicted to laughing. I go to see a lot of comedy shows. I'm addicted to playing really loud and obnoxious rock music in my car. I'm addicted to beautiful clothes and shoes. I just love gorgeous stuff and work hard to acquire pretty things, shiny things. I'm addicted to shiny things!","First and foremost, you've got to make yourself happy. Essentially being who you are is the most important thing. When you're after truth, happiness always comes.","We got Martha Stewart legitimizing homemaking for her generation, and then there's this return to being interested in all things home, lifestyle, and food again. I think this generation is less about the frills and more about the flavor of things.","Just because one likes to cook up a great meal or decorate their home doesn't mean they have to do it with granite counter tops and duck a l'orange.","My parents immigrated from Italy and spent 40 days and 40 stinking nights on a boat so we didn't have to eat things like gizzards.","You don't just turn on a camera and do a cooking show. If you want to go somewhere with something, you've got to make it look like what it's supposed to look like five years from now.","You know, we don't have any decorative sprigs of rosemary; we're not placing little matchstick radishes onto an hors d'oeuvre... The food's gotta taste good. The concept's gotta taste good.","Often with television, particularly with lifestyle entertainment, they really try and box you in.","I grew up in a food-obsessed Italian family, so food was always front and center in my life. I was a food obsessed person who morphed into a comedian and tried to figure out a way to make fun of my cake and eat it too.","I believe that anyone can cook a great meal. Basically all you need to do is get your hands on some fresh ingredients and not be afraid to make a mess in the kitchen.","Julia Child wasn't afraid to have fun. She made fantastic food but knew how to have a good time and not be too stuck up about the kitchen space.","Like the old Italian saying goes, 'It ain't rocket surgery.'","North America was ready for something other than a vanilla cooking show and we were providing the double dark chocolate fudge."],"Nadine Gordimer":["A desert is a place without expectation.","People give one another things that can't be gift wrapped.","There is no moral authority like that of sacrifice.","Responsibility is what awaits outside the Eden of Creativity.","The creative act is not pure. History evidences it. Sociology extracts it. The writer loses Eden, writes to be read and comes to realize that he is answerable.","The gap between the committed and the indifferent is a Sahara whose faint trails, followed by the mind's eye only, fade out in sand.","Power is something of which I am convinced there is no innocence this side of the womb.","I cannot live with someone who can't live without me.","From Ernest Hemingway's stories, I learned to listen within my stories for what went unsaid by my characters.","Truth isn't always beauty, but the hunger for it is.","Perhaps the best definition of progress would be the continuing efforts of men and women to narrow the gap between the convenience of the powers that be and the unwritten charter.","Writing is making sense of life. You work your whole life and perhaps you've made sense of one small area.","Time is change; we measure its passing by how much things alter.","Censorship is never over for those who have experienced it. It is a brand on the imagination that affects the individual who has suffered it, forever.","A child understands fear, and the hurt and hate it brings.","The facts are always less than what really happened."],"Nadine Labaki":["I want to keep talking about my people and my country in my own language.","A small film from a small country, in Arabic with nonprofessionals: It was practically impossible. Just to make it was like a dream to me.","When people say to me, 'You make us proud,' it's heartwarming to hear that.","I thought if my son was now eighteen years old and he was tempted to join the fight and take the burden of protecting his family - because it's always tempting especially for young men - what would I do as a mother to stop him?","I was watching TV and saw people with masks, weapons, and grenades. I thought, Is that really possible? Could we be here yet again? And go into civil war one more time?","Beirut turned into a war zone in a matter of hours. We were stuck at home, the roads were blocked.","I like to have the impression that whatever is happening is true.","I don't like to be feared, and I can't work in conflict, I'm very bad with conflict. I try to avoid it, it paralyzes me.","I'm just someone who observes a lot."],"Nadine Velazquez":["I am inspired by anything beautiful. Sometime it's a pair of eyes or flowing gorgeous hair, other times it's the sky or a sunset. I've been inspired by supple skin or the texture of a soft shirt.","I am Puerto Rican. I think Latinas are sexy, and being one, it has influenced a lot of my style, but being an official Los Angelite, this town has influenced most of my daily style, which is relaxed & easy.","I don't usually like a smoky eye; if there is any smokiness, it's got to be a light color.","I'm very comfortable being naked. It's one of my favorite things to do.","I love acting and I have a need to do it, even when the business is down.","I hope to land roles where my presence is carried on throughout the film. I'm looking forward to taking on a role with a complicated backstory and yet someone who refuses to lose sight of hope. I know that it will happen someday.","I am the only one in my family to graduate college. It was a proud moment for me to receive a degree.","I like men in suits. Men in suits I think are so sexy. But I love men in suits who own their own businesses. That's even sexier... I just love a guy who has his own thing going on and believes in it.","When I die, I want to be buried in a long long-sleeve black Ralph Lauren dress and brown chunky boots. I want my hair styled like his models, long hair that flows. I also want natural makeup with a light pink lip.","I have started my own foundation. It's called Follow Your Art. It's at its infancy but my goal is to mentor teenage girls through one of the most difficult times in their lives.","I would love to have a drink with Meryl Streep or Prince. Those are my top two people I would love to talk to.","I want Prince to see something I do and call me and ask me to be on an album or if I want to dance!","I've always exuded some connection to my sexuality even as a kid. So to me, being sexy means staying connected to that part of me.","My dream role would be to act with Denzel again!","I want to move people, stir something within them that makes them feel. That's what a movie should do and an actor should do, make you feel something. I think that's why people love films so much.","We spend so much of our lives not feeling but doing, doing, doing, and movies remind us that we are human. That life is all the things we see, and yet there is beauty there. There's a celebration of life and all of its intricacies. Movies are magnificent.","My first job was a McDonald's commercial. It made me want to wake up at 4 A.M. to do something I loved. I haven't been the same since.","When you're rehearsing, you get really inspired in the beginning, but then it becomes repetitious and you lose the magic. How do you get the magic again? The magic happens when you're not pushing it.","I'm attracted to men who just love what they do, have confidence in what they do and have potential to be on their own if they need to be.","I've never been driven to just be a celebrity or just get me on TV. Never ever. What's always driven me is being successful and being good at what I do.","As a child, I was hyper, I was a clown and I was sensitive. Today I'm all of the above, except I've refrained from bouncing off the walls.","I'd seen 'Punky Brewster,' I'd seen 'Webster,' I saw 'Annie,' and it was time to either be an orphan or an actress.","I'm a driven person, but I'm also cautious, and I overthink things sometimes.","I would love to be a guys' girl, but they always end up falling in love with me, so I'm a girls' girl instead. I've tried having friendly relationships with men, but it ends up being impossible, and I've been around the block too many times not to see it coming.","I have a real taste for doing action roles. I starred in a movie called 'Blast,' which was my first action film, and I loved the fighting - I think I've got the build, the attitude and the look for it.","I went to a girls' school, and it was awful. The combination of my teenage anger and their jealousy meant I was always getting into fights. There was a lot of pulling of hair and scratching of faces and rolling around on the floor.","Really hairy backs on men turn me off. I'm not into the ape thing at all. Or beer bellies and flabby arms, either. Also, one random nose hair which is longer than the others... that's gross.","I simply wanted to get through college as quickly as humanly possible. I had no interest in extracurricular activities or anything that required me to be social. I was allergic to people.","Whatever's missing in your relationship, including a marriage, is what you're not bringing to it.","Things aren't always clear at the beginning of a relationship. Be up-front. Don't play on her confusion or vulnerability. Women want and appreciate clarity.","It's true - women want the fantasy. So give them romance - but without the desperation, wondering, and waiting you see in the movies.","Something like 'The Matrix' would be ideal, something where it's super agents and wire work and special effects - not necessarily running from bombs and shooting people. Something more sleek, like an assassin.","I have a scar on my right arm from my ex-husband. He was cooking and he had a hot pot and he turned around and went right into my arm.","My party trick is that I ask everybody questions. I'm just nosey.","I got kicked out of a club for sticking up for my sister. And I got into a fight that was basically hair pulling and rolling around on the gym floor. The fights make me sound like a hell-raiser, but I'm not proud of them.","Hi, I'm Nadine Velazquez, and my green tip is: recycle."],"Naeem Khan":["I love designing bridal. I do not follow trends - I design dresses that are relevant to the times.","All the embroidery is made in my father's workshop in India... and all the cutting and sewing is done in my studio.","Every designer needs a story. Mine is all about glamour because my family has been in the business of glamour for three generations. My grandfather Shamshuddin Khan started his embroidery and fabric-making business in the 1930s.","I came here when I was 20. I came to go to school, but I ended up working for Halston as an assistant. That happened in a very strange way. My father had a meeting with Halston. And my father said to me, 'Join me. I want you to meet this amazing American designer.' And I happened to just tag along, and Halston offered me a job.","The design process usually starts as a fantasy, with ideas that I dream of and visualize. These ideas become a reality by bringing various ingredients together, from the lifestyle of my bride, her age and sex appeal, to the textures of the finest fabrics and embroideries that we produce in my family factories in India.","My favorite part of designing bridal is that I will be a part of the most important day in a woman's life. My work needs to make her feel sophisticated, glamorous, sexy, and comfortable.","India always inspires me.","My childhood was a happy one. I was captain of the school sports team and played cricket after class. I had five younger siblings and a large loving family that lived together. We are still very close.","My parents noticed my love for clothes and encouraged me to study design abroad. I decided to join the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York but never ended up there.","Halston was one of the hardest-working designers I have come across. The way he cut, moulded, manipulated and draped fabric was inspiring. I was submerged into the Halston subculture alongside Andy Warhol, Liza Minnelli, Elizabeth Taylor and Truman Capote. They shaped who I have become as a designer.","The power of celebrity backing has been crucial. I would say that 90 percent of our brand recognition comes from celebrities wearing my pieces.","Most pieces take between two and three weeks and involve more than 40 people from the fabric cutters to the embroiders to the sewers. It's an elaborate undertaking.","The world I travel is my inspiration. I name my dresses after cities that inspire me.","When I was designing Mrs. Obama's dress, half of me was saying, 'What would Halston do?' The other half was saying, 'Be who you are.' Halston, me, America, India - it's been such a great combination. This is what makes me who I am, with the clean lines I learned from Halston and complicated Indian over-the-top Bollywood traditions."],"Nafisa Joseph":["I used to love dogs until I discovered cats.","Sometimes, I sit down to sketch at the unearthly hour of 3 in the morning!","I love being photographed, I love the ramp.","I won the crown for what I am - I'm certainly not going to let go of that!","The greatest injustice in the world is to bring a child into the world, and not be able to offer it peace.","Ummm, there is not just one good thing about being a VJ, it is a package deal. It is a fun job and you get paid to party and have a good time and make people have a good time, which is great.","I was a little nervous backstage. But I had this book, Gandhi. I just read his quotes, closed my eyes and focused my thoughts. Presently, this book is my prized possession.","I have always loved animals since I was very young.","I didn't want to get into acting. I was very happy doing MTV, it took up my time, I was content.","Winning is very important to me. I wouldn't be happy with anything less. And I work towards my goal.","People feel I don't mix much, but I'm working at it.","Most important was to remain focused and always have presence of mind.","Deep inside, I was hoping I'd win: The competition was tough, but I learned from other's mistakes."],"Naftali Bennett":["Conscientious objection is an intrinsic part of being a soldier.","If you want to change things, it requires bravery.","Judaism doesn't recognize gay marriage, just as we don't recognize milk and meat together as kosher, and nothing will change it... I'm not a hypocrite; I state my positions.","If you truly believe in a united Jerusalem, deeds have to be more than words. We need a real united Jerusalem. It takes determination, audacity, and money to provide full services and law enforcement in the entire city.","The term 'demilitarized Palestinian state' is an oxymoron.","In a perfect world, there would be freedom of religion and freedom for all religions to exercise their religion everywhere.","Europe is especially vulnerable to terrorists who may hide among the refugees pouring across its borders.","Things are expensive, very expensive in Israel for many reasons. One of the reasons is our ports. It's a monopoly. They run very poorly. And we have ships that are stuck in the ocean for three or four days or a week, and all that cost is transferred to the products and the consumer.","Jews can build in New York, Moscow and Paris, but in our own land, we can't build? That's nuts.","The biggest danger for any organism is to not identify that it's being threatened. I want to hope that people realize that the source of danger and risk in the Middle East is not the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but the deep radical Islamic vision of forming a global caliphate.","Jews have been living in Jerusalem way before British people were living in London.","Israel is not Vegas, and it will not be.","I don't believe in regime change, certainly not in the Middle East.","I state in no uncertain terms: An order to uproot an Arab village or a Jewish settlement violates the most basic of human rights... It's a difficult dilemma.","No one wants peace more than me.","There will not be a billion-shekel cut to education on my watch.","The State of Israel must be at the forefront of global science - in physics, in mathematics, in medicine, in biology.","Iran doesn't need one centrifuge. Canada has nuclear energy. Spain has nuclear energy. Switzerland has nuclear energy, and they don't enrich uranium. You don't need to enrich uranium in order to use nuclear energy. You enrich uranium in order to produce a bomb.","Any deal that allows Iran to enrich uranium, which allows them to ultimately break out within a few months with a nuclear weapon, is a disaster for the world.","Can you imagine what will happen to the global economy if Iran comes out with a nuclear weapon? The whole area will enter a nuclear race - Saudi Arabia, Turkey.","What I'm working is for peace on ground between Israelis and Palestinians through business, through economy, through quality of life.","There's 2 million Palestinians that govern themselves. They have their own parliament, their own government, their own elections, their own tax system. I don't want to govern the Palestinians; no one does. They already govern themselves.","Not everything can be solved quickly.","We need to do everything possible to save the Jewish state. We don't have another Jewish state.","I am proud of religious Zionism. I am proud of the members of religious Zionism because it is a true ideological public.","I would never take my children and place them next to missile launchers.","If you want to conduct terror against Israelis, which is unacceptable, send fighters to do it. Don't send your women and children.","I myself am a former commando fighter.","Israel never targets civilians deliberately, period.","The whole Land of Israel is a single bloc. There are those who say we can build inside the settlement blocs, and others who say we may not be able to hold onto the towns outside the blocs. I have come to tell you what the Arabs already know - that the Land of Israel is one bloc.","The Land of Israel goes with the Torah of Israel under the sovereignty of the State of Israel.","We must continue building in all corners of the Land of Israel, with determination and without being confused.","You cannot force a state to be demilitarized. Even if a state enters a treaty where it commits to be demilitarized, there's no way to reverse statehood if it violates it.","In the Middle East, we don't have the luxury to indulge in fantasy.","For Israel to retain its amazing position as the largest concentration of high tech after Silicon Valley, we need more engineers and mathematicians. We have too many lawyers.","Netanyahu supports - and he truly does support - building a Palestinian state within Israel.","There are roughly 22,000 Palestinians working side by side with what you call settlers in factories and malls in the West Bank. If you work together, you start understanding each other.","I'm vehemently against population transfer. I'm against expelling anyone from his house, ever - whether it be a Jew or an Arab.","I'm not going to tell the Palestinians how to arrange themselves. If they want to have their own entity and their own parliament as they do today, that's fine. If they want to connect to Jordan, which has a very big Palestinian population, and vote in the Jordanian government, that's fine.","I think people appreciate honesty.","You don't talk to terror organizations!","It often takes time for the Israeli government to get things done.","I am often in contact with the hareidi public and politicians.","I very much admire Uri Ariel. I think he's a man of principles, and effective, and I love him.","There's been a significant amount of Israelis who are joining my party because they think that Israel has to have a tough stance in this crazy environment called the Middle East.","Israel will not divide its land. We're already too small.","I have not one shred of anger in my heart against Netanyahu or his wife.","It's totally viable to envisage a million Jews living in Judea and Samaria.","I don't see any difference between Judea and Samaria and the rest of the country.","Judea and Samaria can be a place of refuge for the nation.","Let's be honest: discrimination against Arabs exists in Israel.","We know that 99.9% of Arab-Israelis are loyal to Israel.","When you negotiate with terrorists, you get more terror.","Sooner or later, Israel will have to defeat Hamas. There is no way around it.","Netanyahu's raison d'etre is to save Israel from Iran. That is it. That is his mission in the most profound sense. I have seen it up close.","The Palestinian Authority has become the biggest terror body in the world.","Israel is not the safest place in the world for Jews. Melbourne in Australia is better. Teaneck, New Jersey, is safer.","Israel, contrary to most of the West, has a high fertility rate, so there's a lot of young people in Israel. Most families have three kids as opposed to one or two, so a big proportion of the population is under 30.","I spent most of my career in hi tech, not in politics.","I want every Israeli child, secular and religious, to know about Moses, about Maimonides, about Yoni Netanyahu, about Hannah Senesh and S. Y. Agnon. I want every child to know how to read the Bible, and know how to make Kiddush.","I love the people of Israel. I love the land of Israel. I love the Torah of Israel. I love the Israel Defense Forces. I love our soldiers. If you feel the same way I do, you have a home.","I want the world to understand that a Palestinian state means no Israeli state. That's the equation.","No country in the world is going to recognize that Ariel and Maaleh Adumim and Beit El are a sovereign part of Israel.","I have one identity, and that's Israeli and Jewish. I don't view myself as an American citizen.","It's no secret that I wear a kippa.","Haredi youth are smart, and they are going to bring a big benefit to the high-tech industry.","Israel now has a reputation around the world of being not just a place to develop products and technology but to develop ideas.","Historically, the National Religious Party, which my party - Jewish Home - is built upon, has aligned itself in consecutive Israeli governments with the ultra-Orthodox factions.","The Israeli government has already established a fund to encourage young Arab women, specifically from the Bedouin community, to study engineering. We are funding their university studies and providing them with mentors who assist them with their studies and the job placement process.","In my previous career as a chief executive of high-tech companies, I experienced firsthand the endless possibilities when people from diverse backgrounds work together. They get to know one another and quickly learn that they share more in common than they originally thought.","As soldiers in Israel's army, one of the most grueling training regimens we had to endure was a long march while carrying a comrade on a stretcher.","People think that Israelis are mean, evil people who only want to hurt Arabs all day.","The Israeli public is frustrated with the way it is portrayed abroad.","Factually, the Temple Mount is the precise location of the Temple. It's the holiest place in the world for Jews. It's the third holiest place for Muslims. And we need to respect each others' rights, freedom of religion.","I opened about a dozen employment centers for Arab women across Israel during my two years as minister of economy.","You can't build a society without law.","I myself have felt the wrath of the media, but that's part of what a good democracy is.","The reality is, if you were fortunate to be born to rich parents, you have a better chance of succeeding in life.

There is a great lack of comprehension on the part of some readers.","In Egypt today most people are concerned with getting bread to eat. Only some of the educated understand how democracy works.","If the urge to write should ever leave me, I want that day to be my last.","Events at home, at work, in the street - these are the bases for a story.","I love Sufism as I love beautiful poetry, but it is not the answer. Sufism is like a mirage in the desert. It says to you, come and sit, relax and enjoy yourself for a while.","I reject any path which rejects life, but I can't help loving Sufism because it sounds so beautiful. It gives relief in the midst of battle.","History is full of people who went to prison or were burned at the stake for proclaiming their ideas. Society has always defended itself.","I accepted the interviews and encounters that had to be held with the media, but I would have preferred to work in peace.","I was suffering from a peculiar and persistent sense that I was being pursued, and also the conviction that under the political order of the times, our lives had no meaning.","The writer interweaves a story with his own doubts, questions, and values. That is art.","There are no heroes in most of my stories. I look at our society with a critical eye and find nothing extraordinary in the people I see.","Today's interpretations of religion are often backward and contradict the needs of civilization.","Without literature my life would be miserable.","I didn't make any money from my writing until much later. I published about 80 stories for nothing. I spent on literature.","God did not intend religion to be an exercise club.","Insults are the business of the court.","At my age it is unseemly to be pessimistic.","As the tension eases, we must look in the direction of agriculture, industry and education as our final goals, and toward democracy under Mr Mubarak.","Hosni Mubarak... his constitution is not democratic, but he is democratic. We can voice our opinions now. The press is free.","I am practically in the employ of Mr. Nobel. I have to meet everyone he sends my way.","I wake up early in the morning and walk for an hour. If I have something to write, I prefer to write in the morning until midday, and in the afternoon, I eat.","My countrymen have the right to shake my hand and talk to me if they so wish. Don't forget that their support and their reading of my works is what brought me the Nobel prize.","We are passing through a very sensitive time, and on the whole, this country is facing very big problems.","If we reject science, we reject the common man.","If you want to move people, you look for a point of sensitivity, and in Egypt nothing moves people as much as religion.","The Arab world also won the Nobel with me. I believe that international doors have opened, and that from now on, literate people will consider Arab literature also. We deserve that recognition.","I started writing while I was a little boy. Maybe it's because I was reading a lot of books I admired, and thought that I would like to write something like that someday. Also, my love for good writing pushed me.","According to Islamic principles, when a man is accused of heresy, he is given the choice between repentance and punishment.","I believe society has a right to defend itself, just as the individual has the right to attack that with which he disagrees.","I consider Khomeini's position dangerous. He does not have the right to pass judgment-that is not the Islamic way.","I defend both the freedom of expression and society's right to counter it. I must pay the price for differing. It is the natural way of things.","I thought they would never select an Eastern writer for the Nobel. I was surprised.","I was a government employee in the morning and a writer in the evening.","I was reading a lot of books I admired, and thought that I would like to write something like that someday.","I've never worked in politics, never been a member of an official committee or a political party.","It is simply not part of my culture to preserve notes. I have never heard of a writer preserving his early drafts.","My wife thought I deserved it, but I always thought the Nobel a Western prize.","One effect that the Nobel Prize seems to have had is that more Arabic literary works have been translated into other languages.","Sadat made us feel more secure.","The criminal is trying to solve his immediate problems.","The Koran and the laws of all civilized nations legislate against the vilification of religions.","We are like a woman with a difficult pregnancy. We have to rebuild the social classes in Egypt, and we must change the way things were.","We used the Western style to express our own themes and stories.

They don't know it, and it's frustrating me because I feel that it's an edge that I have, and I'm not talking about I took this hip hop class, I'm talking about this is how people actually know me.","It's funny because a lot of people that know me as a dancer, don't know that I'm a singer, and a lot of people that know I can sing don't know I can dance. And so, I feel like at some point I have to show them both and really be able to display it and showcase it, and put that out there.","No matter what as an artist that's always what you want to do, you want to connect to the audience, you want to be able to send whatever message it is that you're singing about, you want to be able to convey that - and not make them feel - you want them to feel it, you want them to feel what you feel.","My first impression when I made it through was 'Good, because I'm going to prove to you that I deserve to be here', because they told me that sometimes I lack confidence in my performance and sometimes I'm not as consistent as they'd like me to be.","I wouldn't compare myself to any past Idol contestant, because I don't feel like I am like any of them. Maybe stories are cool but my story is different from most people's story. I don't like to compare myself to other people, I like to just be me.","If my life was a song the title would be 'Naima'.","I prefer to sing in the shower because the acoustics make you sound great, baby.","I cried when I found out I was a finalist, I kind of went limp when they called my name. I felt like my spirit jumped out of my body, and I was just flesh - it was just amazing.","I wouldn't mind doing Broadway, but I am definitely trying to get a album out there first.","I couldn't imagine having to write a paper and have to think about what song I am going to sing.","The live setting is always better for me. I usually thrive at live. I feel like having a band behind me and being able to interact with the crowd helps boost my energy up.","I've been doing African dance all my life.","It's believing you can push through the exhaustion just to be able to sing after you do a cartwheel or a split.","Always stay true to yourselves."],"Najat Vallaud-Belkacem":["We need everyone to be a feminist. Feminism is the fight for the equality of sexes, not for the domination of one sex over another.","When I look back at where I came from, at the school I attended... my classmates for the most part haven't had successful paths - many have had a difficult, chaotic path.","Equality in education is my number one battle.","It's more necessary than ever before to ensure that discernment and the development of a critical mind guide our take on the world and inform our relationship to the media and information.","It's important to understand that one gender is not superior to the other.","We have to reappropriate the concept of laicite (secularism) so we can explain to our young pupils that whatever their faith, they belong to this idea, and they're not excluded. Secularism is not something against them; it protects them.","How can a child adhere to school and the notion of secularism when they see their mother rejected from a school outing, stigmatized, left on the sidelines, just because she has a scarf on her head?","My dream of society is a society where women are free and proud of their bodies.","Reading changes your perspective and feeds your imagination.","I molded myself against le Front National. Against hate speech, be it racist, sexist, xenophobic, or homophobic. Against the kind of injustice I faced during my own life.","When I started out, it was rare to see elected representatives with foreign roots. Often, I was relegated to my origins, put in the diversity box: 'You're the new face of diversity.' That annoyed me because I always felt French, and suddenly I was being made to feel I wan't as French as others.","I feel totally French - I don't feel half-French because of my dual nationality. For me, dual nationality just means I don't deny my roots.","I'm aware that beyond my own need to find a personal balance, I should be sending a signal to society as women's minister about the importance of work-life balance.","Compared to some of our neighbours, it's not frowned upon to be a mother and work in France.","If a big number of young pupils felt secularism was an attack on them, it was because the term had been misused and deformed in the public debate for years by the extreme-right and the right as an attack on Islam. The term had often been misused to point out how Muslims were different to others, and that is clearly problematic.","On certain, delicate subjects, bringing in outsiders to talk about values is pertinent because pupils listen to them more attentively.","School was always a major player in my personal journey. It allowed me to open up to the world, and also social mobility. It allowed me to enrich myself, to read, learn and understand.","It is not just family that must transmit values, but school also.","I was very shy and reserved, so it was a bit contradictory to get into politics.","I decided to make a lifetime commitment against social injustices, against inequalities, and that is why I am profoundly from the Left.","By continuing to increase teacher recruitment and training - and ameliorating wages and working conditions - we will be able to shore up the weaknesses of the French education system.","In Europe, we will work towards having a common stance, while in France, we will strengthen our protection for asylum seekers whose lives are in danger because of their sexual orientation.","We have to be careful not to have a form of militant secularism in our country, which is counter-productive for children we would like to see - adhere - to secularism.","As long as there is no proselytism... we must facilitate the partnership between parents and schools.","The education ministry files suit every time there is a case of identity fraud.","Our universities also have a lot of foreign students. Are we going to ban them access because in their culture there's a certain type of clothing?","People can't even imagine that it's possible to succeed anymore.","I have a chart for success at school because it gave me a great deal of pleasure. It opened my mind to the world. I learned to read.","I would like all French children to have unlimited opportunities opened up for them as French minister of education.","Low income persons in need of social housing should be housed in more prosperous areas to avoid placing an extra burden on the poorer areas and to redress the balance in terms of housing, redressing the balance in terms of schooling.","There is no link between the terror attacks of Daesh and the dress of a woman on the beach.","It was the students who entered kindergarten in 2011 who are - and I am weighing my words carefully - the sacrificed generation. It is they who have paid a high price for the politics of yesterday - that is to say, the government of Mr. Fillon.","The proliferation of bans fuels stereotypes and discriminates against a community.","We have several million Muslims in France who are mostly moderates or non-practicing. If they feel that it is the only subject in public debate, they won't feel at home and will be tempted to withdraw to their communities.","If you're asking me in a general context whether I'm for or against the burkini, the response is simple: I oppose the burkini.","You should be appeasing people as much as possible, not stigmatising them. The ban of the burkini puts into question people's individual freedoms.","Do we have to give Mr Sarkozy a history lesson? Yes, there are Gauls among our ancestors. But there are also Romans, Normans, Celts, Nicois, Corsicans, Arabs, Italians, Spanish. That's France.","I'm like all parents who try to shelter their children.","We know that if religion is allowed into schools, pupils will sometimes begin to question the teaching they receive.","The fact of leaving one's country, one's family, one's roots, can be painful. My father had already found his place, but for us, for my mother, it was very difficult to get our bearings.","Preventing children from going to school, and preventing teachers from doing their jobs, seems to be not just undemocratic but intolerable.","Inequality of women concerns both India and France, though it might have different manifestations in both the countries.","Is it written that equality between men and women means one can change sex? Obviously not.","School is at once a place of hope, but it's also a laboratory that exposes our differences.","Some Muslim students experience secularism as an act of aggression.","Teachers alone can't educate young people."],"Najib Mikati":["Peace along with freedom and justice are the pillars for attaining both security and stability and will pave the way towards the eradication of oppression, extremism, and terrorism in our world.","I wish - I wish the peace and good for the Syrian citizen and the Syrian regime.","What I'm trying to do is save and rescue the country if I can, and I'm doing my best to do it.","I believe in the stability of my country. I believe in unity.","We have to look to the well-being of the Lebanese citizens and create prosperity in the country, and you can't create prosperity without stability.","My agenda is not to reassure anybody outside Lebanon.","I thank God that I left office the same way I came in: with integrity.","I announce the resignation of the government, perhaps as the only way for Lebanon's main political blocs to assume their responsibilities and come together to pull Lebanon out of an unknown tunnel.","What I'm trying to do, and my policy, is to disassociate, to shy away from what's going on in Syria.","Historically, we were always complaining about others interfering in our domestic and national issues.","I am Lebanese, and I know the interests of my country.","I am not keen just for the position; I'm keen to help and to serve. If I can really avoid any bad things on my country, I will not hesitate one second.","Stability cannot occur without a Palestinian Spring through the full implementation of the Palestinians' right to self-determination on their land.","If I'm still walking, I am not dead. So I have to still walk and run towards the benefit of Lebanon.","The most important, what I believe myself to do, is what is the interest of Lebanon, what is the interest of my country and my nation? And I'm going to do it fully.","I cannot either change or do anything bad or good to the Syrian people and Syrian citizens.","I choose my words very delicately because I have a divided society.","I have a friendship with Hezbollah, and I also have contacts outside of Lebanon, but it doesn't mean I follow anyone's agenda.","My own agenda is going to be followed, and that agenda is to maintain very good relations with the international community, and Lebanon has to fulfill its commitments.","I am keen to maintain very good relations and develop the relationship with the United States.","I believe nobody is stronger than the state. So the state would be strong, and we have to work altogether to make the strength of the state.","In my opinion, the Hezbollah has going - they are going to discover sooner or later than in their top priority should preserve Lebanon.","We open our door, and we are still committed to open our door for our brothers in Syria. But doesn't mean that we should not keep alone. The international community should really - should really share Lebanon the numbers of refugees and share Lebanon the cost of their living.","I call on the people of Tripoli to restrain themselves and not get drawn into conflict with anyone."],"Najib Razak":["What I'm trying to do is get a change in the mindset so people move from a level of mere tolerance to total acceptance and eventually to celebrate diversity. If you feel comfortable with one another, it doesn't matter whether we live in which neighbourhood but we can interact with one another freely. It's a mindset.","My priority is to ensure peace and harmony in Malaysia. That is uppermost in my mind.","This mandate that I seek is about continuity and sustainability against disruption and stagnation, about moving forward versus regressing. We have to safeguard what we have already achieved. We cannot put at risk what we have; we cannot gamble away our future.","Prostitution and corruption are two things that mankind has had to live with for so long.","The world is changing quickly and we must be ready to change with it or risk being left behind.","The word 'change' has been abused so many times.","Don't gamble the future of your children and Malaysia; think and contemplate because your vote will determine not only the future of the country but also your grandchildren.","In spite of the huge diversity in Malaysia in terms of religion, culture, race, ethnicity and so forth, we've really gone very far in developing this country.","Together we will act to bring about national reconciliation, secure Malaysia's economic future, and build a stronger, more harmonious society.","Detention without trial is history in Malaysia.","The vast majority of Malaysians are sensible people; they're moderates, they want peace, they want harmonious race relations at home. They look for national unity.","We can transform the government and the economy, as well as democracy, in Malaysia.","If we can increase the share of Islamic finance for the world, countries can benefit - and certainly, Malaysia can benefit from that.","I would argue that Asean has been instrumental in driving both economic growth and political development, and that there can be no clearer example than its relations with Myanmar.","As a leader of a majority-Muslim nation, I believe Islamic countries must better understand what young people aspire to.","Agreeing to share prosperity, rather than let it divide us, is infinitely preferable to the alternative.","Economic progress and better education have directly resulted in the birth of a class of voters who are better informed, very demanding and highly critical.","People willy-nilly borrow for consumption. Civil servants willy-nilly borrow for consumption and then wonder why they don't have enough money at the end of the month.","I speak for all Malaysians in expressing my admiration for the Queen and the grace, poise and selflessness with which she has carried out her duties during her long reign. She represents the very best of British traits: dignity, resilience and hard work.","In any society, there will be the whole spectrum of views. You will get the extremists on the far right and also the far left.","It's very alarming to see what's happening in the Muslim world. And it's about time we come to our senses and realize that moderation is the only path that will ensure peace and stability for the Muslim world, and for the wider world.","You must make sure that the majority of the people are not marginalized.","The disappearance of MH370 has tested our collective resolve.","Instead of passing on choppy waters to the next generation, we should endeavor to leave them a calmer sea.","I am concerned if 25 percent of Americans think that President Obama is a Muslim. I mean, it's obviously a lack of knowledge. But also, it's for the Muslims as well, you know, because a small numbers of Muslims have really painted a very negative image of Islam.","Anyone who wants to be part of the political process should adopt values that are compatible with democracy.","We have lost a lot of ground to the extremists in the Middle East.","Moderate doesn't mean that you're a wimp - far from it. It means that you've chosen a path because you believe that's the only way for global harmony and peace.","Anything to do with any new form of tax, like consumption tax in Japan, carbon tax in Australia, these are big issues that cannot be easily decided.","I've made Umno more democratic, more inclusive. Of course, by doing that, I'm putting myself at risk.","As you know with the Arab Spring, there were no dividends.","It so happens, in Malaysia, the people who are in a way not doing as well constitute the majority of the people - the Bumiputeras.","If you say something that undermines the stability of the country, then you have to be held accountable.","There's good economic progress in Malaysia. People have a lot to look forward to.","Over the past months and years, divisions have opened up in Malaysian society. Now it is time for all of us, in government and beyond, to put the bitterness behind us.","After choosing monetary union, further political union and workable governance in Europe was always going to be necessary.","The stabilising power of economic union was one of the reasons the E.U. was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.","The world is shifting from a hegemonic era, where the United States dominated alone, to a multipolar system.","The E.U.'s 500 million citizens enjoy the right to live and work in any of the Union's 27 member states.","The Arab awakening was driven by youth, organized by technology, and fired by a hunger for political change.","Many young Muslims see no opportunities for themselves and do not feel they have control over their lives or a stake in their nation's future. Such pessimism leads to disengagement. We risk losing a generation of young Muslims to apathy and extremism.","In the space of one lifetime, the Internet has opened up opportunities that were previously inconceivable.","More than 13,000 Malaysians travel to the U.K. to study in British universities every year.","For many decades, Myanmar was on the receiving end of very public diplomatic scoldings, often backed up by sanctions.","For many years, Myanmar's leadership was largely shut out from the world of international diplomacy.","As the leader of Southeast Asia's oldest democracy, I am always keen to share our experiences. In the half-century since independence, we have found that steady reform is the best way to secure lasting stability. It is a process that continues in Malaysia to this day.","My heart reaches out to those whose loved ones were lost on MH17.","I'm quite an advocate of free trade.","You should allow professors to become really outstanding academicians, recognised worldwide, and you should reward them.","Homosexuality is acceptable in the West.","I keep on saying, being moderate is fundamental to Islam.","I think the rise of China is inevitable, because China has moved from a low-cost producer, at low levels of technology, to higher levels of technology, and because it's very competitive, even in some high-tech products they offer at very competitive rates - much lower than their competitors.","Giving subsidies is a two-edged sword.

I was not always doing things I wanted to do.","During my grief, I realised there was nothing I could do for my mother, but I did have a child.","I think afterall, a promotion video is a piece of work in it's own right.","In the beginning, I didn't dance that much and stuff.","I think that ballads are always something where I can really become one with the audiance.","I get even more nervous singing when everyone's fallen silent, but I really try to communicate the meaning of the lyrics, and there's people there listening to that, and if they're moved by it, then I'm moved as well.","If I get to wrapped up in how I have to be, or what I have to do, things gradually get worse and worse.","If I don't think about anything, and start with a clean slate, in terms of what I have to do, a lot of different ideas come up, and I can think about things more openly.","Up until now, I had ideas that I wanted to try but didn't have the opportunity to do them.","Until now, I've not done a project where the produce, rapper and singer has never worked together like this before, and I had a chance to try a variety of styles.","Actually, recording the Suite Chic album was so much fun and while working on this new album, people that I've worked with from Suite Chic has lend their voice.","If I can't get a mental image from the song, I won't sing it.","Until now, I was insecure and I believed what the people around me said in regarding what I should sing.","Simply, there are many things I would like to do.","I'm not completely at ease at rapping, I can't do it well yet.","From my debut until now, I've always wanted to sing and dance.","Aside from my work, in my everyday private life, I'm not a very adventureous person. I don't look for change.","For the most part, I don't care about what everyone else is doing, or what is popular.","Even where friendship is concerned, it takes me a long time to trust people."],"Nan Fairbrother":["The hardest of all is learning to be a well of affection, and not a fountain; to show them we love them not when we feel like it, but when they do.","We are perverse creatures and never satisfied."],"Nan Hayworth":["We have to honor our commitments to today's beneficiaries, but we can't solve the growing deficit and debt problems unless we are smart, courageous, and sensible in planning for future.","If we can return to a government that the Founders, in their wisdom, envisioned for us, we can return to a government that will allow our economy to thrive again, and our people to live in liberty.","We need to do things better, but in a way that makes sense.","The government would be making decisions about what type of care is given, what procedures can be performed, and the kind of medications prescribed. It would be a very profound change from the ideal to which we aspire.","Doctors cannot afford to provide care at the rate of reimbursement that Medicare insists that they accept.","Jay Townsend has offered, and I have accepted, his resignation from his position with my campaign. Now let's return to talking about issues that really matter to families: job creation, spending restraint and economic development.","Right now, there are nearly 30 jobs bills passed by the House with support from both Republicans and Democrats that are awaiting action in the Democratic-run Senate.","We are hopeful that President Obama, in his State of the Union Address, will express a willingness to work with Republicans to enact all of these jobs bills.","We were elected in a wave because the people in America, if they had a single issue that troubled them the most, it was that health care vote.","We're facing a natural disaster in the middle of an economic disaster. The federal government has to balance its budget the way our families do.","The tenor of the comments as we got closer and closer to August got dominated by 'Wouldja please get this over with' and not let us go into default.","I like going to rifle and pistol clubs and joining them in target shooting. I also share the same respect for individual initiative and love of family."],"Nana Mouskouri":["I do believe that if you haven't learnt about sadness, you cannot appreciate happiness.","One of the most wonderful memories in my life was when I sang at the Opera House in Sydney. I will never forget that. It is one of the most beautiful Houses I have ever sung in my life.","When you want something very dearly, you make the time.","I think sometimes you are born with a song.","If I was sad or afraid, I would sit in a corner and sing. If I was happy I would jump into the middle of the room and sing. It was how I expressed my emotions.","How you looked was not important. It was what you did and how you did it. Decide to do it and then do it the best way you can.","When I was singing, everybody liked me.","Wherever you turn, there is always something wrong with the politicians. They have everything they need to save the world, and they don't save it.","When I started to work with UNICEF, it was a new way of giving some love and care to the world.","The Berlin Wall go down, that was the most wonderful thing that could happen, absolutely. I celebrated with everybody in Berlin that day when the Wall was down.","When I was very young I was the ugly duckling. I had a lot of complexes. My sister was wonderful and I was nothing.","Every time I would open my mouth to sing, everybody was paying attention to me. It became a habit.","I grew up thinking that singing was my security.","It's nice to look good, but the most important thing is to be you.","I thought it was respectful to each country to sing in their language.","I was born a singer. I need to do that.","My energy to sing, I get it from my singing. Singing was not a reason to make a living. This is the only thing I wanted to do.","With my songs I tried to prove that there is love.","When I heard his first songs, Dylan was answering certain questions that I had all my life been asking myself.","My friends gave me the first songs which was the first food in my soul for me.","There were wonderful moments when I was singing for the first time in the Olympia Theatre and I was pregnant with my son, which was very, very strange for a singer.","I like to cook, but mostly Greek. When I am confused or tired, I think about what I can cook. It takes you away from everything, as you are thinking only of your dish.","The secret is to cook the aubergines the day before and let them dry of all the oil they drank in cooking. When you cook aubergine, they eat a lot of oil. It can be very heavy.","The idea of the European community is never face a war again.","I left the table where there were important people and had lunch with my husband and a few friends. The reception was organised in my honour, so it was rather amusing.","Once I was condemned to three months' absolute silence. As I could not speak, I wrote a book.","For my convalescence, I had to exercise my voice only with vowels.

It is a great way for me to be able to live a fantasy life as a writer because I get to be someone else, someplace else for three and a half minutes, just like the listener.","Being a good songwriter means paying attention and sticking your hand out the window to catch the song on the way to someone else's house!","Live well. Sing out, sing loud, and sing often. And God bless the child that's got a song.","It was nice to focus on things outside of my body. Music has always done that for me.","I've always been a very prolific writer.","I was always more interested in story songs, things with a point of view... and things that informed me."],"Nancy A. Collins":["Back when I was growing up, getting caught with a copy of 'Creepy,' 'Eerie' or 'Vampirella' was almost as bad as your parents finding out you were reading 'Playboy.'","I'm very excited about taking over the reins on Vampirella. I've really been enjoying myself so far.","I cannot sing Vampirella artist Patrick Berkenkotter's praises loudly or often enough.","The vampires in the 'VAMPS' series judge each other as harshly as they judge humans, and basically, vampires don't get along very well. So you've got a culture that's from cradle to grave like the worst high school you've ever been in.","One of the things that may appeal to teenagers is that vampires never change - they're frozen in that age.","If you could stay at this stage - you're 17, and you're always going to be in love with your first love - that's probably attractive.","I became a horror fan during the early 1960s, back when Hammer was putting out their groundbreaking 'Dracula' series with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, and grew up watching 'Dark Shadows.'","Vampires are handy characters, as they can do double duty as monster/villains and the classic, misunderstood romantic hero.","I've been writing in some way, shape, or form for as long as I can remember.","The best advice I got as a writer was also the first advice, which came from the late fantasy author and editor Karl Edward Wagner: Any agent who charges to look at your work is a crook.","I know about various fictional and folkloric vampire mythoses the way other people know about the personal life of celebrities.","Horror serves a cathartic role in human society, all throughout the world. It is a way of confronting the darkness, both within and without.","Personally, I don't trust people who go out of their way to state they never read or watch horror and insist there's something wrong with those of us who do."],"Nancy Allen":["Although I performed in high school, my first real experience with theater was performing with a student-run organization at Vanderbilt University called The Original Cast where I learned that I loved performing and especially loved theater people.","I knew I wanted to pursue a career in the theater the minute I graduated from college having not pursued it! So I went back to school and got a degree in music and began working in musical theater.","The more you work with anyone, the more comfortable and safe you feel. The more you have an understanding.","If I could play any role in any musical, it would be Desiree in 'A Little Night Music' - Oh my, it is perfection. The character gets to be funny, beautiful, sexy and smart all at the same time and have two men fighting over her. The show is Stephen Sondheim at his absolute best... need I say more?","The three theater peeps I would love to dine with are Mel Brooks, because he is so funny; Stephen Sondheim, because he is a god-like genius; and Ethel Merman, to compare notes on fabulous belting."],"Nancy Astor":["Real education should educate us out of self into something far finer; into a selflessness which links us with all humanity.","The first time Adam had a chance, he laid the blame on women.","Women have got to make the world safe for men since men have made it so darned unsafe for women.","I married beneath me, all women do.","One reason why I don't drink is because I wish to know when I am having a good time.","The penalty of success is to be bored by people who used to snub you.","Pioneers may be picturesque figures, but they are often rather lonely ones.","The main dangers in this life are the people who want to change everything... or nothing.","The only thing I like about rich people is their money.","I refuse to admit that I am more than fifty-two, even if that does make my sons illegitimate.","In passing, also, I would like to say that the first time Adam had a chance he laid the blame on a woman.","My vigor, vitality and cheek repel me. I am the kind of woman I would run from."],"Nancy Banks Smith":["Anthropology is the science which tells us that people are the same the whole world over - except when they are different.","In my experience, if you have to keep the lavatory door shut by extending your left leg, it's modern architecture.","You carry forever the fingerprint that comes from being under someone's thumb.","Agatha Christie has given more pleasure in bed than any other woman."],"Nancy Carell":["I'm a terrible cook, but I make very good lobster salad.","What I don't miss is living in a small town where everybody knows you, your family, and what you ate for breakfast."],"Nancy Cartwright":["Remember, you can always find East by staring directly at the sun.","I will not expose the ignorance of the faculty.","Adding 'just kidding' doesn't make it okay to insult the Principal.","I didn't do it, nobody saw me do it, there's no way you can prove anything!","I don't use the voice of Bart when I'm making love to my husband, but Marge's voice turns him on a little.","Cursive writing does not mean what I think it does.","The Good Humor man can only be pushed so far.","The fundamental laws of physics do not describe true facts about reality. Rendered as descriptions of facts, they are false; amended to be true, they lose their explanatory force.","I will not get very far with this attitude.","I am not authorized to fire substitute teachers.","The Pledge of Allegiance does not end with Hail Satan.","Since September 11, security has been increased everywhere, and we have new IDs to get on to the Fox lot. I drove to the security gate, but realized I'd left my ID in my other car. I just broke into that voice - 'Hey, man, I'm Bart Simpson. Who else sounds like this?' The guard waved me through."],"Nancy Duarte":["Words that are carefully framed and spoken are the most powerful means of communication there is.","My best advice is to not start in PowerPoint. Presentation tools force you to think through information linearly, and you really need to start by thinking of the whole instead of the individual lines.","To me, presentations are the most powerful device. You can't really name a movement that didn't start with the spoken word.","The future isn't just a place you'll go. It's a place you will invent.","Your ability to shape your future depends on how well you communicate where you want to be when you get there. When ideas are communicated effectively, people follow and change.","Most presenters are consumed with preparing their content rapidly, which makes the material about their own narrow perspective.","Some people rehearse to a point where they're robotic, and they sound like they have memorized their presentation and didn't take it to the next level. Going from sounding memorized and canned to sounding natural is a lot of work.","Phrases that have historical significance or become headlines don't just magically appear in the moment. They are mindfully planned."],"Nancy Dubuc":["Live news teaches you some incredibly strong lessons: that every day is a new day, and it's never too late to fix something.","One of the epidemics in our industry is the abuse of power.","The perseverance and the strength and the determination and the sacrifice that so many millions of people have had to endure to form this country is far greater than anything that we can really imagine.","With a strong foundation in scripted programming firmly established by 'Army Wives' and 'Drop Dead Diva,' Lifetime is aggressively expanding its drama series development plate with powerful programs from creative auspices who have strong pedigrees in producing stand-out programming.","We knew in our gut that History needed to be more than a timeline.","We need to get rid of bullying. We need to get rid of abuse. We need to get rid of harassment. We need to get rid of the casting couch. Instead, we need to build the bench.","It's easy for the board to say, 'Well, add makeover shows.' The No. 1 show for women in the United States is 'The Walking Dead.' That's not a makeover show.","It's hard for me to accept the argument that millennials are not watching TV. I'm not one to believe that our culture of TV consumption is changing dramatically. It's just how we consume and where we consume it that's changing.","My heart has always been in programming and marketing.","My interests were more extracurricular, more external, and more social than they were academic. My birthday is also in December, so I was one of the older kids. That meant I learned social leadership early on. I was always just much better in a team and work environment than I was in a classroom environment.","The directness of my mother is clearly in my voice. Her opinion is always a very strong opinion at the dining room table. I think she empowered me to have the same drive.","There are very few black-and-white truths in management or in business, but one that I have found is that people either hire people who are smarter than them, or people hire people they can control.","Celebrating failure is key. Half of what we do fails, at least.","When you meet a veteran, thank them for their service.","I'm not a very patient person. I'll take those quick risks to see if it's going to work versus taking the long and tortuous road of trying to guarantee myself that something will work. That's like self-mutilation to me.","We have to take a really close look at making sure that we are more surgical and more tailored in dealing with the production community and our producing partners.","To address what seems like an endless cycle of gender inequity in media, I believe we need to think beyond what our industry has already tried to do through mentorships and internships. We need to stop talking and start moving the needle, and one solution is to simply give women jobs.","Great managers recognize that there is no one way to manage. You may have to be 10 different managers to get the best out of your team.","Personally, I feel a strong responsibility to make sure that we have women equally represented in our executive suites and that we employ women in front of and behind the camera and in our writers' rooms.","I have an innate passion and competitive streak to win and to create, and I want our team to be better than everybody else. Some people thrive in that environment, and some people don't.","A show could be 10 minutes, seven minutes, 94 minutes. We just need to tell the stories that need to be told.","Both of my grandfathers served in World War II, both in the Pacific. One wouldn't talk about it, and one would.","If we can be changing some lives along the way, that's the holy grail on television.","It's not enough just to put great television shows out anymore.","Historically, we've had to think in increments of 30 or 60 minutes. And now we have to think in increments of six seconds to six hours and everything in between.","I am here to tell you, TV is not dead. Rather, it is constantly evolving as we are. My view is that we are in the next Golden Age of content. If AOL, Google, Netflix, Amazon, and Yahoo felt TV was dying, they would not be so eager to play in our sandbox. It is, after all, TV content that's driving their business.","It's a terrible thing to say, but I hated school. I'm very ADD, and my report card always said, 'If only she performed to her potential.'","I'm a very goal-oriented person, and work is really rewarding. It's how I take care of my family, and ultimately, I'm never going to let that responsibility fall to anybody but myself.","I'm a big believer in picking your boss, not the job. Great people create great jobs.","It's an honor to be the only woman in the room a lot of times, but I wish I weren't the only woman in the room. I still have to think in a calculated way about how to speak and what to speak about.","The beauty of the media business is all about what is next. You put your mistakes behind you. Learn from them and move on to the next project. Having some degree of success is integral to a risk-taking balance.","In the media business and as a creative executive, if you don't take risks, you're dead in the water. Calculated risk taking is essential for success. No one said it was easy.","I run a creative company, and the best way to support creatives is to make them fearless and willing to take big swings. That is an important part of our culture at A&E Networks.","Obviously, there needs to be parity. I think as more women get to the top, we need to make sure that is the case. It is our responsibility.","TV is our window on the world. It's a powerful medium for great stories that become part of our very, very personal journey.","I love it when a man knows his place - right, ladies?","When I think about too much content out there, one of the things that comes to mind for me is just the volume of really outstanding creators there are.","I would love to see more swings in areas that we haven't explored. I can't necessarily tell you what that is - I think you know it when you see it - but I think we've had a lot of the same-themed shows in broadcast, but those shows are still performing.","When you look at the increase in the number of scripted series and the number of unscripted hours, the pool of producers hasn't grown at the same rate. So I think there's a bit of a creative tax on the system.","A lot of people make hay about 'American Idol''s ratings and 'Empire.'","My focus - even before becoming CEO - has always been memorable and unique content. And one of the most important things we did to reinforce that was create A+E Studios.","What someone does when viewing content on a tablet is different than the lean-back mentality of watching on the big screen.","We've learned that you can't just put your promos up in a digital environment and expect the consumer will accept that as shortform content. It needs to have a unique point of view and style and execution that is tailored to that platform.","A+E Networks has been my home for over a decade. I am so proud of these brands and my A+E colleagues who are truly the best in the business.","We aren't afraid to take creative risks, which is the main ingredient in our recipe for change.","At our core, we are a content company. That content has to be the very best. You can't be a company of this size and be doing what everybody else is doing.","I'm not a very patient person.","We were an entertainment brand, and if we were going to compete in an era of incredible growth in the cable industry, I felt we actually needed to be entertaining.","Sometimes people get fairly obscure just for the creative license of it, and that can backfire. Iconic stories are iconic for a reason, and there are so many incredible, iconic history stories that have not been told that we don't need to go too deep in the well yet.","It doesn't make any sense for us to do a scripted series if it's not going to be big, so we have to be really disciplined about them.","Taking action against a show because of one individual's behavior could put hundreds of jobs in jeopardy.","I think we all have to ask ourselves, as leaders, do we have the right processes in place for complaints to be filed and for people to feel protected?","I'm enormously proud that I can do a deal with the National Women's Soccer League to showcase the power and passion of women athletes as positive role models, not only for my daughter but also for my son.","There is a lot of content out there for the female demographic.","It's my job... to push people out of their comfort zones. But we got to have a reason to do it. We don't do it gratuitously.","There needs to be a bigger focus on creative innovation versus business models and cash flow.","It takes a long time for things to get off the ground.","It never seems like a good idea to do something that's way out there. But usually, the thing that's way out there is where we are heading.","Writing a check is easy. The opportunity for real change happens when there's a person who comes to you with real passion to create a movement.","One of our secret-sauce powers is that our people don't just write checks and place the ads, but our employees go the extra mile to get things done.","When I stepped into the Lifetime role in 2010, I did a listening tour of what was going on for women in this country. There was such a parallel in Hollywood with women talking about how there are stories that are not getting made and that talented young women are not getting the opportunity to direct and write.","I grew up in Bristol, R.I. I had grandparents and great-grandparents nearby, and because I was the only grandchild until I was 12, I was the center of a lot of adult attention.","A+E has always looked in places where others didn't want to look. There's a service in that.","Owning content and original content has been our lifeblood - we've never been a suite of brands that's been reliant on a movie library or on rented series from other networks.","I think it's important for History to keep experimenting with their shows. The more documentary-driven, the returning series, are the bottom of the iceberg under the ocean that keeps it moving, and then it's important to take those swings and see if we can ignite a spark with new audiences.","Lifetime never had any unscripted shows, really. It just had 'Project Runway,' which was a bit of an island.","I think that the strategy around FYI is really a corporate strategy, and that's that every one of our brands that we invest in have to matter and that we need to commit to building brands and investing in those brands, or we need to get out of that business.","In the media business and as a creative executive, if you don't take risks, you're dead in the water. Calculated risk-taking is essential for success.","I interned at NBC News and had a great experience there in both New York City and Washington. After graduating, I got an entry-level production job at PBS in Boston. There, I developed the bug for programming and production.","The best advice I give to young people starting out is choose your boss. Regardless of gender, I think it is important to have someone who supports you and lets you take risks without fear of failure.","Veterans' issues have always spoken to me.","You can have whatever platform you want, but without great content, you don't have anything.","You can't manage the creative process on a quarterly basis. The way we're structured has really helped us grow.","The History brand has long been a supporter of not only our troops but organizations that support our troops.","It's always strange to get an honor from people who are the ones that should be honored.","To effect meaningful change, you have to look at who's in the boardrooms, who has the financial control of businesses, and who has the greenlighting power.","What I see around the management team meetings and the conference tables I sit at is that there isn't that same comfort level in other women who are rising the ranks. And I don't know how to fix that.","I think the culture and DNA of our organization is to take risks.","Successful shows will always generate great business deals in the future.","Beautycon has done an incredible job growing and evolving their business into a major player not only in the experiential marketplace, but also the digital content and ecommerce businesses.","We don't see the Lifetime brand as just a television brand. We see it as a female media brand. It has to represent what she is interested in, up and down the spectrum, in all kinds of content.","We're trying to create the connections of today that become the next generation's memories of tomorrow.","We have a powerful portfolio of brands that are well-positioned for future growth, both domestically and internationally.","In Vice, I saw all of it in one. I saw a studio. I saw a content creator. I saw an agency. I saw a distributor. We want to learn from them. They're talking to a generation we're struggling to connect to as an industry.","We've always been for women, and we always will be for women. How we express that will be fluid over time as generations move forward.","You had a generation of women, of which I'm part, where it was a stigma to be associated with feminism; there was a backlash. Now you have a generation that is clearly embracing feminism because, at the end of the day, the definition of feminism is just equality.","If you look at the coverage of female sports and athletics across any of the broadcasters that participate in league rights and/or sports programming, women are underrepresented, and it's a chance and an opportunity for Lifetime to support that movement and the importance of athletics and competition for girls and women.","If you're going to be a media brand and not just a linear television brand, then you have to make sure you're speaking to all women and all interests, so it may mean that you end up smaller audiences serving individual pieces of content, but the aggregate is what's important and what we're paying attention to.","We'd all like to be in the business where we don't have to report our numbers, too. You're dealing with a Netflix and an Amazon that don't have to report their viewership. They're not sharing those numbers, so how do you work with a creative entity to renegotiate future seasons when nobody has metrics?","I know that when I'm watching a drama that I love, I'm disappointed when it's over at the end of an hour.","Storytelling takes many forms, and even feature-length storytelling is often 90 minutes or two hours. There's nothing stopping us from trying to do that on a week-to-week basis.","You have to follow the consumer, and the consumer will be in control.","In this rapidly changing media environment, business transformations need to be closely linked to communications strategies.","Panna is focused on the intersection of premium video content and digital product to deliver great experiences. Given those are areas of focus for FYI, we are extremely excited to partner with Panna.","So much of our audience is on mobile and online platforms, but there's something special, unique, and unexpected about engaging with such great content at the street level.","Hearst makes smart investments and partnerships across important industries, and HearstLive is the perfect opportunity to highlight the amazing innovations coming out of all of those brands.","'Cinnamon Girl' is a game changer for our network and is exactly the type of show we want to deliver.","Vice has a bold voice and a distinctive model in the marketplace. This channel represents a strategic fit and a new direction for the future of our portfolio of media assets.","Shane Smith has led Vice from a fledgling magazine into a global media brand, and all of us at A+E are excited to work with him and his passionate and innovative team.","Consumers are looking for those trusted brands to help with search and discovery and streaming content choices.","We knew that bringing a level of entertainment value to the subject of history was the key to our success.","I think people take for granted the success of the original content at A&E Networks and in building brands. People have selective memory on how long that takes.","We know romance novels are a huge thing. Can we do a romance novel show on our network? I'm not sure.","Each generation wants their own form of entertainment and their own form of storytelling.","We love the Vice guys; we believe in them. We're investors. We believe in them, in the creative work that they've done... What they built is incredible.","You can never rest on what you did yesterday; it's old.","'The Hatfields and McCoys' is a classic tale of American history. These are names that are widely recognized, yet few people know the real story that made them famous.","As a global media company, A+E Networks continually seeks to create new and exciting content that will attract audiences today, tomorrow, and beyond. By investing in Vice, we are thrilled about our potential to further deliver content that meets the demands of the latest consumption trends.","As a former college athlete, I know the importance of sports in the lives of women and girls, and I couldn't be more thrilled to join forces with NWSL and U.S. Soccer to ensure professional women athletes are elevated as the entire country can watch and be inspired by their strength and athleticism.","From Abby Lee Miller's intensity and her students' incredible performances to their devoted moms and its high drama, 'Dance Moms' has become one of the most compelling shows on television.","'The Client List' represents everything we want to be - fresh, exciting, and original with attitude.","There's still too much filler, copycat programming that's out there. We work so hard to pioneer new ideas, and then those ideas are just regurgitated by other networks. That's not good for anybody, I think. That's not good for our business. That's not good for our audience.","I can't count the number of times I've sat in a meeting where it's been 20 men and me.","We're not seeing enough women rising to the top."],"Nancy Farmer":["My view of civilization is that there have always been small pockets of good, decent, kind people surrounded by corrupt and evil power structures. It's always a battle to stay on the side of good.","I live in a 'sky island,' a unique mountain valley environment where half the animal species of North America can be found.","I never hand in a book until it's completed. Richard Jackson then reads it and asks me to clarify murky points. We work very well together. He knows how hard to push, and I know how hard to push back. He's the only person who can criticize my work without me throwing a hissy fit.","I am now writing a book called 'Far Enough,' very loosely based on my childhood. This is difficult because it forces me to remember people I loved who are gone.","I started writing 'The Lord of Opium' in 2008 and produced about 80 pages before disaster struck. Three eye operations nearly put an end to my career.","Music has a tremendous effect on me. When it's playing, I can't think or do anything other than listen. But I can write to it."],"Nancy Friday":["Blaming mother is just a negative way of clinging to her still.","I think biologically we are attracted to more than one person, but given society and our needs, monogamy works better.","I think the thing I miss most in our age is our manners. It sounds so old-fashioned in a way. But even bad people had good manners in the old days, and manners hold a community together, and manners hold a family together; in a way, they hold the world together.","When I stopped seeing my mother through the eyes of a child, I saw the woman who helped me give birth to myself.","Because society would rather we always wore a pretty face, women have been trained to cut off anger.","Inside every adult male is a denied little boy.","To say something nice about yourself, this is the hardest thing in the world for people to do. They'd rather take their clothes off.","The older I get the more of my mother I see in myself.","The debt of gratitude we owe our mother and father goes forward, not backward. What we owe our parents is the bill presented to us by our children.","I like the company of men. I've never been welcome in those groups, but then I would no more go to a consciousness-raising group and talk about my intimate life with my husband than fly to the moon. I never understood all that.","I'm sure it's why I'm such an odd duck in my feminist generation, because I've always been equally fair to men.","Women's behavior in handling beauty, even before feminism, was to deny they had any. Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.","Dreams are the expression of the unconscious while we are asleep.","Fantasy isn't something you run out of.","If women really want equality, we have to wipe the slate clean. It no longer matters in the largest sense what men did to us for the last 200 or 300 years."],"Nancy Garden":["I write for young people because I like them and because I think they are important. Children's books can be mind-stretchers and imagination-ticklers and builders of good taste in a way that adult books cannot, because young people usually come to books with more open minds. It's exciting to be able to contribute to that in a small way.","When I was growing up as a young lesbian in the '50s, I looked in vain for books about my people. I did find some paperbacks with lurid covers in the local bus station, but they ended with the gay character's committing suicide, dying in a car crash, being sent to a mental hospital, or 'turning' heterosexual.","I think kids in every minority need to see people like themselves in books; that's an acknowledgment of their existence on this planet and in this society.","My writing books with positive gay characters has come more out of anger than anything else: anger at not having been able to find honest, accurate books about people like myself as a teen, books that show we're as diverse as straight people and that we can lead happy, healthy, productive lives just as straight people can.","My coming out, like most people's, was and is a gradual process - for no matter how out one is, there are always situations when one's with people who don't know, and one has the choice or, sometimes, the necessity of coming out to them."],"Nancy Gibbs":["Be bored and see where it takes you, because the imagination's dusty wilderness is worth crossing if you want to sculpt your soul.","Summer is not obligatory. We can start an infernally hard jigsaw puzzle in June with the knowledge that, if there are enough rainy days, we may just finish it by Labor Day, but if not, there's no harm, no penalty. We may have better things to do.","The millennials were raised in a cocoon, their anxious parents afraid to let them go out in the park to play. So should we be surprised that they learned to leverage technology to build community, tweeting and texting and friending while their elders were still dialing long-distance?","A typical smart phone has more computing power than Apollo 11 when it landed a man on the moon.","Obama was elected on a slogan of hope and change because both were in short supply: the military exhausted by two wars, the banks failing their public trust, the U.S. Congress a comedy of dysfunction, and a federal government that seemed designed to idle on the sidelines.","We are bombarded with reasons to stay inside: we're afraid of mosquitoes because of West Nile and grass because of pesticides and sun because of cancer and sunscreen because of vitamin-D deficiency.","Pain is the most private experience, but its causes, whether natural or man-made, demand public accounting.","It's hard to think of any tool, any instrument, any object in history with which so many developed so close a relationship so quickly as we have with our phones.","Today's kids aren't taking up arms against their parents; they're too busy texting them.","The crossroads of science and politics is a dodgy place.","Rooting from the sidelines is the most democratic of sporting rites: no skyboxes, no tickets required, just an unabashed will to holler and wave.","High school is a haunted house in April, when seniors act up because the end is near. Even those who hate school sometimes cling to the devil they know. And for the kids who love it, the goodbyes are hard to think about.","Photographer James Nachtwey has spent his professional life in the places people most want to avoid: war zones and refugee camps, the city flattened by an earthquake, the village swallowed by a flood, the farm hollowed out by famine.","Power is a tool, influence is a skill; one is a fist, the other a fingertip.","Modesty means admitting the possibility of error, subsuming the self for the good of the whole, remaining open to surprise and the gifts that only failure can bring. There are many ways to practice it. Try taking up golf. Or making your own bagels. Or raising a teenager.","The leading cause of death for girls 15 to 19 worldwide is not accident or violence or disease; it is complications from pregnancy. Girls under 15 are up to five times as likely to die while having children than are women in their 20s, and their babies are more likely to die as well.","If boomers were always looking to shock, millennials are eager to share.","Runners exalt the marathon as a public test of private will, when months or years of solitary training, early mornings, lost weekends, rain and pain mature into triumph or surrender. That's one reason the race-day crowds matter, the friends who come to cheer and stomp and flap their signs and push the runners on.","All great rebellions are born of private acts of civil disobedience that inspire rebel bands to plot together.","We know what the birth of a revolution looks like: A student stands before a tank. A fruit seller sets himself on fire. A line of monks link arms in a human chain. Crowds surge, soldiers fire, gusts of rage pull down the monuments of tyrants, and maybe, sometimes, justice rises from the flames.","Emotional life grows out of an area of the brain called the limbic system, specifically the amygdala, whence come delight and disgust and fear and anger.","People don't blame the act of driving for auto accidents.","Making distinctions is part of learning. So is making mistakes.","In the case of the classic Western helicopter parent, it starts with Baby Einstein and reward charts for toilet training, and it never really ends, which is why colleges have to devote so many resources to teaching parents how to leave their kids alone.","Twenty-first century war adds new risks: more and more often there are no front lines, no central command, no rules of engagement - only a chaotic collision of politics, power, faith and bloodlust. Victims are as likely to be civilians as soldiers.","Once there was a boy so meek and modest, he was awarded a Most Humble badge. The next day, it was taken away because he wore it. Here endeth the lesson.","The 1950s felt so safe and smug, the '60s so raw and raucous, the revolutions stacked one on top of another, in race relations, gender roles, generational conflict, the clash of church and state - so many values and vanities tossed on the bonfire, and no one had a concordance to explain why it was all happening at once.","High achievers, we imagine, were wired for greatness from birth. But then you have to wonder why, over time, natural talent seems to ignite in some people and dim in others.","Back in the really olden days, dinner was seldom a ceremonial event for U.S. families. Only the very wealthy had a separate dining room. For most, meals were informal, a kind of rolling refueling; often only the men sat down.","In many parts of the world, more people have access to a mobile device than to a toilet or running water.","New Orleans lives by the water and fights it, a sand castle set on a sponge nine feet below sea level, where people made music from heartache, named their drinks for hurricanes and joked that one day you'd be able to tour the city by gondola.","When National Guardsmen shot four unarmed students at Kent State, virtually the entire system of higher education shuddered and stopped.","Maybe we adults idealize our own red-rover days, the hot afternoons spent playing games that required no coaches, eating foods that involved no nutrition, getting dirty in whole new ways and rarely glancing in the direction of a screen of any kind.","It's always been a luxury to be able to hop a plane to Paris, to Venice, to the Grand Canyon.","Pour a liquid out of its container, and it changes shape, fills the space you give it. If you give children a lot of space, it may surprise you where they'll go and the shape they'll take.","Time is valuable; people are busy.","Enter politics, and you enter the glass house; there are no secrets and no places to hide.","Bill Clinton left office with a more than 60% approval rating.","What cultural DNA remains from those first Puritan forays onto American soil may be our love of a fresh start.","All our efforts to guard and guide our children may just get in the way of the one thing they need most from us: to be deeply loved yet left alone so they can try a new skill, new slang, new style, new flip-flops. So they can trip a few times, make mistakes, cross them out, try again, with no one keeping score.","Calling Rand Paul 'the most interesting man in politics' is an invitation to an argument - but one we suspect he'd love to have.","When U.S.-based editors and columnists parachute into a news storm, it is often the stringers who keep us out of trouble, helping us glimpse the complexity behind the headlines.","Decision making in a democracy depends above all on knowledge and not just the intel available to presidents and policymakers.","The understanding of Syria's devastating civil war has been distorted by the immense danger and difficulty of covering it.","We will never know if any other president approached Nixon in paranoia, profanity or potential criminality, since only his conversations were captured, subpoenaed and ultimately released on the front pages of newspapers.","When I was coming out of college, storytelling was very much something you did with pencil and paper, so the technological platform versatility, I think, is really valuable.","'Sesame Street's' genius lies in finding gentle ways to talk about hard things - death, divorce, danger - in terms that children understand and accept.","The days of the Pentagon Papers debates seem long past, when a sudden transparency yielded insight into fights over war and peace and freedom and security; the transparency afforded by Twitter and Facebook yields insights that extend no further than a lawmaker's boundless narcissism and a culture's pitiless prurience.","I would like to see every newspaper and every magazine have a network of bureaus all over the world, gathering news.","The one problem with the Internet for journalists who like doing long form is that any story that's going to involve 16 screens on the web page... that's asking a lot of people.","Death will never be pretty - its sights and smells too close and crude. And it will never come under our control: it gallops where we tiptoe, rips up our routines, burns our very breath with its heat and sting.","Power is not just political. It can be cultural; it can be spiritual.","I like the fact that glass ceilings are breaking all over.","If anything, the power of the cover of 'Time' has increased as the media landscape has atomized.","Teaching sometimes seems like not one profession, but every profession. We ask them to be doctor and diplomat, calf-herder, map-maker, wizard and watchman, electricians of the mind.","Barack Obama wants teacher service scholarships.","Hillary Clinton wants to leave behind No Child Left Behind.","What is it about summer that makes children grow? We feed and water them more. They do get more sun, but that probably doesn't matter as much as the book they read or the rule they broke that taught them something they couldn't have learned any other way.","Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth were slaves by birth, freedom fighters by temperament.","Professor Obama has at least talked to us like we're adults.","There's a smartphone gait: the slow sidewalk weave that comes from being lost in conversation rather than looking where you're going.","You can't predict when a crisis might hit your family, whether it's with an elderly parent or with your children.","Right now, doctors can test for about 2,500 medical conditions, but they only can treat about 500 of those. So what do you do with the knowledge about the others?","As you probably know, I've written a lot about the presidency, so it's obviously exciting when you get to interview a president and write about it.","I've been grateful that 'Time's' reach and mandate is so broad; anything you're interested in, you can usually write about.","I feel like my competition is everything else that's competing for people's attention, not just other print magazines, newspapers and cable. It's your kid's report card and the games you want to play, all the things that compete for people's time.","You can't hold up a blog; you can hold up a magazine.","There are many things that matter much more than an editor's gender in shaping the direction of the leadership.","I don't think it's necessary to shout if you have a good story. But I also don't think you should shy away from being bold in the statement that you're making.","The Reverend Jeremiah Wright would baptize Obama, perform his marriage to Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, baptize their daughters, and draw him into the raucous, restless family of faith that Obama had never known before.","I've always found that once you're in the door of a place and you have the chance to show how you operate and how talented you are, then anything can happen.","There's something very Nixonian about the idea of keeping an enemy's list.","I'm wondering how many elected figures any of us could find who do not, in the front or back of their minds, remember who does them favors, who doesn't.","Sure, we want to know what a president believes in... but that doesn't always mean he should tell us.","We've seen what happens when it serves a president's interest to flaunt his faith - which is almost inevitably does, since every poll affirms that Americans want their leader to submit to some higher power.","It's no secret that the media has fragmented in recent years, that audiences have been cut into slivers, and that more and more people get their news from ever narrower outlets.","I come from a family of teachers, and I believe ideas matter; the good ones deserve reverence, and the bad ones, defiance.","Rarely has a new player on the world stage captured so much attention so quickly - young and old, faithful and cynical - as has Pope Francis.","The Catholic Church is one of the oldest, largest and richest institutions on earth, with a following 1.2 billion strong, and change does not come naturally.","When you are a media celebrity, every word you speak is dissected, as are those you choose not to speak.","It's funny how things change slowly, until the day we realize they've changed completely.","At times, it seems as if the only women effortlessly balancing their jobs, kids, husbands and homes are the ones on TV.","Progress is seldom simple; it comes with costs and casualties, even challenges about whether a change represents an advance or a retreat.","Across much of the developing world, by the time she is 12, a girl is tending house, cooking, cleaning. She eats what's left after the men and boys have eaten; she is less likely to be vaccinated, to see a doctor, to attend school.","In sub-Saharan Africa, fewer than 1 in 5 girls make it to secondary school.","As long as people have been making little people, they've wanted to know how not to.","The typical white American woman in 1800 gave birth seven times; by 1900, the average was down to 3.5.","There was a time when researchers imagined that Plan B, or the morning-after pill, might become not an emergency form of contraception but a routine one; women would take it once a month to induce a period and never even know whether they had gotten pregnant.","Members of royal families are born into a world of indulgence and entitlement, and the princelings who grow up that way may never have to develop any discipline.","There may be no less original idea than the notion that our hearts hold dominion over our heads.","It is actually the neuroscientists and evolutionists who do the best job of explaining the reasons behind the most unreasonable behavior.","Whatever people thought the first time they held a portable phone the size of a shoe in their hands, it was nothing like where we are now, accustomed to having all knowledge at our fingertips.","Americans are grateful for the connection and convenience their phones provide, helping them search for a lower price, navigate a strange city, expand a customer base or track their health and finances, their family and friends.","Girls grow up scarred by caution and enter adulthood eager to shake free of their parents' worst nightmares. They still know to be wary of strangers. What they don't know is whether they have more to fear from their friends.","Democracy presumes that we're all created equal; competition proves we are not, or else every race would end in a tie.","Some people are born strong or stretchy, or with a tungsten will.","A runner's stride is not perfectly efficient.","Adolescence, that swampy zone between safety and power, is best patrolled by adults armed with sense and mercy, not guns and a badge.","Inflicting emotional distress has typically been treated as a civil action. How 'substantial' does the distress have to be for it to turn criminal?","We want laws to be applied predictably.","I have two daughters: One an open book, one a locked box. So the question of privacy is a challenging one. How much do kids need? How much should we give? How do we prepare them to live in a world where the very notion of privacy opens a generational chasm?","Anyone with the right mix of parental paranoia and entrepreneurial moxie can make a fortune by selling parents the equipment we think will keep us one step ahead of our kids.","Our children will outwit us if they want; for when it comes to technology, they hold the higher ground. Unlike other tools passed carefully and ceremonially from one generation to the next - the sharp scissors, the car keys - this is one they understand better than we do.","Most of us were probably less than immaculately honest as teenagers; it's practically encoded into adolescence that you savor your secrets, dress in disguise, carve out some space for experiments and accidents and all the combustible lab work of becoming who you are.","Just because we eat together does not mean we eat right: Domino's alone delivers a million pizzas on an average day.","It's the experts in adolescent development who wax most emphatic about the value of family meals, for it's in the teenage years that this daily investment pays some of its biggest dividends.","Family dinner in the Norman Rockwell mode had taken hold by the 1950s: Mom cooked, Dad carved, son cleared, daughter did the dishes.","The real luxury travel of the modern age is not through space; it's through time.","A lot of camps and summer programs for kids seem to have discovered that among the most valuable things they offer is what they don't offer. No Wi-Fi. No grades. No hovering parents or risk managers or parents who parent like risk managers.","Time dissolves in summer anyway: days are long, weekends longer. Hours get all thin and watery when you are lost in the book you'd never otherwise have time to read. Senses are sharper - something about the moist air and bright light and fruit in season - and so memories stir and startle.","Sometimes justice is at its most merciful when it's blind.","Years later, nothing makes me more grateful as a parent than my daughters' encounters with classroom wizards.","Rand Paul does not like being compared to his father Ron any more than sons named Bush like to dance in their father's shadow, but the crucial difference is that while the Bushes all hail from the relative mainstream of the GOP, the Pauls have an ideological tributary virtually to themselves.","My husband and I don't have sons, so we never had to ask ourselves how we'd have felt about them playing football.","In modern warfare, journalists are among the first responders, seeking out truth in the turmoil and wreckage, wherever it takes them.","War is being waged all across the country against the invasive plant and animal species - some 50,000 of them - now spreading across the U.S.","While many alien species are harmless, others pose expensive threats to seas and fields and forests.","I live in a dumb house. Which is not to say that I don't love its quirky charm, its drafty windows and leaky fireplaces and an electrical system that protests when too many people are trying to vacuum and microwave at the same time. But charm is not always user-friendly.","In design as in life, smart can also mean wise, kind, inspiring - and cost-effective. And that has a charm all its own.","On the court, Jason Collins is not a huge basketball star, but he has already claimed his place in civil rights history as the first openly gay athlete to play in one of the four major U.S. sports leagues.","It is faith that drives us to build, a belief that we cannot be limited by lack of nerve or airspace.","Once a conflict has dragged on for a decade, most people are tired of war - and the troubles that flow from it.","The battles after the wars are over can be the toughest; there's no longer the public interest that accompanies, for good and for ill, the start of combat.","Few Westerners know Iran as well as Robin Wright: her first trip there as a journalist was in 1973, and she has covered every important milestone since, from the Islamic revolution and the hostage crisis to the more recent staring contest with the West over Tehran's nuclear program.","Most professional women I know - myself included - long since gave up looking for a rulebook or a roadmap; we make it up as we go along. Every day presents a new choice, a new challenge, which makes long-term career planning seem like an especially abstract exercise.","A good president needs a big comfort zone. He should be able to treat enemies as opportunities, appear authentic in joy and grief, stay cool under the hot lights.","As a candidate, Obama disdained the game of politics, a self-conscious contrast to all the tireless political athletes named Clinton.","Obama promised a return to competence and confidence and asked the nation to believe again that the government could do big things well. In the end, he got his big thing, a once-in-a-generation revision to the basic social compact, a commitment of health coverage to nearly all Americans. He has yet to prove he can do it well.","Americans sometimes ask what the government does and where their tax money goes. Among other things, it pays for all kinds of invisible but essential safety nets and life belts and guardrails that are useless right up until the day they are priceless.","After 9/11, whatever the evidence of intelligence failures, many people still saw that attack as almost unimaginable, so brutal and brazen an assault.","America's presidents tend to die young. Maybe it is in the nature of the men who reach such heights, or of the job once they attain it.","After the 1960s and '70s, there were real doubts about whether a mortal man could handle the country's highest office. It had destroyed Johnson, corrupted Nixon, and overwhelmed Ford and Carter.","Even if it wasn't always morning in America during the years of his presidency, Reagan's eagerness to insist that it was tapped into a longing among voters. They didn't want to picture themselves turning down their thermostats and buttoning up their cardigans. They wanted to strut again. Reagan opened his arms and said, 'Walk this way.'","George W. Bush, though a president's son, is cast as Reagan's heir even more than his father's.","If you want to humble an empire, it makes sense to maim its cathedrals. They are symbols of its faith, and when they crumple and burn, it tells us we are not so powerful and we can't be safe.","On a normal day, we value heroism because it is uncommon. On Sept. 11, we valued heroism because it was everywhere.","Terror works like a musical composition, so many instruments, all in tune, playing perfectly together to create their desired effect. Sorrow and horror and fear.","Accidents at power plants are bad enough. But a leak from a bioreactor could be worse, since bacteria can learn new tricks when you're not looking.","In 2001, President George W. Bush was condemned for politicizing science with his decision to limit federal funding for stem-cell research; in 2009 President Obama was praised for reversing it, even though his decision was arguably just as political.","The path of progress cuts through the four-way intersection of the moral, medical, religious and political - and whichever way you turn, you are likely to run over someone's deeply held beliefs.","Charlie Rangel was writing laws on our taxes as chair of the Ways and Means Committee while somehow neglecting to pay his own.","A president can't go to every memorial service.","All wars, even the noblest, bring a reckoning of means and ends.","Presidents make their hard decisions and then abide forever with their mistakes and regrets.","In the weeks after 9/11, out of the pain and the fear there arose also grace and gratitude, eruptions of intense kindness that occurred everywhere, a sharp resolve to just be better, bigger, to shed the nonsense, rise to the occasion.","I'm sentimental about many things: the lumpy feel of a baby's unused feet, the metallic smell of the air before the first snow, the last scene in 'It's a Wonderful Life.' But Valentine's Day leaves me cold.","Virtues, like viruses, have their seasons of contagion. When catastrophe strikes, generosity spikes like a fever. Courage spreads in the face of tyranny."],"Nancy Grace":["I think the truth is black-and-white.","I have 'To Kill A Mockingbird' signed by Harper Lee. That is my prized possession.","After I lost my fiance, it seemed like it would be better to always be alone than to risk being hurt again.","I majored in Shakespearean studies at a very tiny school in Georgia.","My father was a railroad man his entire life; 43 years for Southern Railroad.","What joy would I get from putting the wrong person behind bars?","I do not favor the gag order.","I always thought that was one of the single most important things a prosecutor could do is to seek justice for the families of victims.","Well, of course I think people can be forgiven. But our justice system is not set up to dispense forgiveness. You can go to the local priest for that.","I have faith in the jury system.","I went nearly 30 years without being able to really seriously entertain marriage or a family. In fact, the word 'marriage' would actually give me a shake when it was brought up.","Look, the justice system is made up of people. People have faults. It's not perfect.","All the criticism and all of the praise, it doesn't - it's not worth the salt that goes on my bread, because TV is fickle. You can be loved one day and hated the next day. One day, you're getting an award. And the next day, you're getting a death threat.","Listen, when somebody says, 'I take the fifth,' well, you know, they did something, OK? Why else would they take the fifth?","I really like my doctors. Some of them I love. I trust them.","I'm on a search for the truth.","I don't really want to have any part of getting guilty people off.","I grew up in a courtroom kind of like the one you saw in 'To Kill a Mockingbird' - big, big courtroom, sometimes it didn't even have air conditioning.","I'm not a judge.","I was a prosecutor for many years, I'm a crime victim myself, and I've tried so many cases I don't even know how many anymore.","Believe it or not, there are people who want to be on juries.","To suggest that you can't be both a mother who is completely in love with her babies, and a professional who is tough and tenacious, is ridiculous.","If I listened to my critics, I would still be at home under my bed right now.","With every story that TV covers, somebody - some corporation, some shareholders - are making money. That's true whether covering Libya, Iraq, the tsunami in Japan, Osama bin Laden, whatever story there is. That day, the shareholders are making money off it. Every newspaper that's sold, somebody's making a dime.","As a prosecutor, I got a paycheck for coming to work every day. I didn't get a promotion when I won, and I didn't get a demotion when I did a bad job.","I was 47 when I got pregnant. I'd been trying for a couple of years and thought it would never happen.","It's hard for me to believe someone could harm a child.","The reality is, when you're representing someone that's guilty, you're in the position of taking that position.","When you have a child victim, I don't think cameras should be in the courtroom, ever.","I don't believe love goes away just because you're buried in a casket.","Court TV will always hold a special place in my heart, and I will always look back at my time there with great gratitude and affection.","I was in the courtroom prosecuting violent felonies for well over a decade.","I think all politicians lie.","I would have liked to personally have prosecuted Scott Peterson.","If you are moneyed or educated, you will get a different sentence than someone who is not.","I don't like juries having the wool pulled over their eyes. I don't think that's what the Constitution is about.","You see, some lawyers have the talent, have the charisma, but no discipline. They come into court unprepared, without having done their research.","I often get too emotionally involved in my cases."],"Nancy Greene":["I think what it takes to succeed remains the same. You have to have a real love of your sport to carry you through all the bad times, you still want to go ski even when things aren't working. You must have a commitment to work hard and to never give up.","Rowing provided a place to go, a community where people cared about what I did and what I achieved.","If it's not 100 per cent pure maple syrup, it can't be called 'pure maple syrup.'","I am thrilled yet overwhelmed. There are so many great women athletes, some incredible performances.","I'm not from a maple producing area and so my maple syrup credentials are very much of the eating side."],"Nancy Horan":["History class was a forty-minute squirm from which I would emerge unscathed by insight. Down the hall in English Lit, though, there were stories to be had, and it was stories I craved.","I guess I'm drawn to artists and literary people and want to learn about them.","One of the great lessons I learned about historical fiction from writing 'Loving Frank' is that you don't try to disguise what people did; my approach was to try to understand the characters and why they did what they did.","I always use primary sources, in addition to reading biographies and other materials.","I'm married to Kevin, a photographer whose career has put him on the campaign trail with presidential candidates and sent him on assignment to far-flung places for long periods of time. It was sometimes rough when our children were small, and I was beginning to write in earnest.","If someone had told me in high school that one day I'd write an historical novel, I would have rolled my eyes.","'Loving Frank' is about a forbidden love affair between two people who lived a hundred years ago - Frank Lloyd Wright and his married client, Mamah Borthwick Cheney. The affair set off a colossal newspaper scandal when the lovers ran off to Europe together.","So this was the big secret historians keep to themselves: historical research is wildly seductive and fun. There's a thrill in the process of digging, then piecing together details like a puzzle."],"Nancy Jo Sales":["We don't really even know how the Internet and technology are changing us, or our brains and our attention span.","I'm concerned and alarmed about the images of girls and women that are broadcast every single minute.","Celebrities are not necessarily the richest people of all, but on the face of it, they seem to be representative of the very richest people.","I love to interview outrageous people who speak their minds; also, people who have some kind of mystery attached to them.","We're so very focused on ourselves and on self-promotion. It goes on all day with Facebook and Twitter and Instagram.","Putting on someone else's clothes is like putting on a mask.","That's why teenagers fascinate me - they're like children with drivers' licenses. Like children in that their impulses are so direct.","Social media is not the same in 2013 as it was in 2003 - or even 2008 or 2011.

So, yeah, I guess I do that a lot.","Yes, I mean, I used to be into the big bulk thing, and that's why my legs look like those of a cyclist instead of a shooter's, but I think there is a point to where too much is not a good thing. I think I try to lower my center of gravity by doing a lot of legs.","No, I think I used to be pretty superstitious about certain things, but I'm really not anymore. As long as I have everything is in order and I have my things as far as the match goes, shooting I'm fine. But I really don't.","A lot of them are afraid to sit down and break their position. You should be able to make it so natural that you can just get out, and sit down and walk away from it, and there's nothing wrong with that.","I mean, one shot you treat like you have forty little matches instead of one forty shot match. It makes all the difference in the world. It's easier to just forget about a not so good shot.","How do I handle it? I would say more times than not, if I have a bad shot, I just get angry and almost like kill the next one. And it usually works I would say 9 times out of 10.","You know, differentiating between training and matches. If they are all matches it becomes very natural to shoot them, although Dan thinks I should shoot more of them. I think I shoot plenty of them.","Once I got to the OTC they knew more about the physical aspects of shooting, and knew which muscles were more important to have trained and geared us a program around that.","Tax bills create wealth.

We believe that a woman considering an abortion should not be forced to have an ultrasound against her will.","I know this president. And I can tell you that he cares deeply about the next generation of young women in this country - his daughters, and everyone's daughters. President Obama had the courage to stand with Sandra Fluke.

But it just made me closer to my family, and I realized that they would always be there no matter what.","There is no age, height, or weight requirement to skate. It is good exercise no matter what your age is. If you want to be competitive, most start young. But, I practice with many adult competitors.","Even now I can't describe why I love skating so much.","I won my first medal when I was nine years old.

And my mother would always get up and eat breakfast with me!","But it seems that the judging maybe they shouldn't at least see the practices all week long. That can taint the way they go into the judging and the outlook of what's going to happen, instead of just watching those four minutes and judging on those minutes alone.","Even now, my husband Jerry, our son Matthew and I live only five minutes away from my parents home, and my brothers live about ten minutes away.

It seems the singles have a little bit of a longer career.","I took group lessons at a rink near my home. We first had to learn how to stand up on the ice wearing skates. Eventually we learned to move forward, but soon found out that it was not that easy to stop! So that was our next important lesson.","I was a tomboy who liked to play rough just like my two older brothers. That's probably why I liked the athletic part of skating - especially the jumping!","I was thrilled one year when I was younger when not only did my brothers get hockey sticks for Christmas - but I did too!","It was always fun to skate with Paul Wylie and Paul Martini.","It wasn't always easy getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning to go to the rink. Sometimes I wanted to just go back to sleep.","My dad worked several jobs to pay for my expense in skating.","My hobbies are painting, crafts, and I like golfing.","My life has been a whirlwind since the '94 Olympics.","My parents never pressured me to skate. They always said I could quit if I wanted to. They only expected me to skate when they had already paid for the expensive lessons. But, otherwise they said I could do what I wanted to do.","One of the things I like best about the Halloween show is that I change outfits about six times in the show. It is a lot of fun to play the different characters.","People are really sick of seeing the winner not win and what the public thinks should happen.","People would ask me why I was doing what I was doing - but I always told them that I just loved to skate. There was no other explanation."],"Nancy Kress":["A stereotype may be negative or positive, but even positive stereotypes present two problems: They are cliches, and they present a human being as far more simple and uniform than any human being actually is.","Before the scene, before the paragraph, even before the sentence, comes the word. Individual words and phrases are the building blocks of fiction, the genes that generate everything else. Use the right words, and your fiction can blossom. The French have a phrase for it - le mot juste - the exact right word in the exact right position.","The worldview implied by literary fiction is complex and ambiguous, trying to be faithful to the complexity and ambiguity of life.","In one sense, every character you create will be yourself. You've never murdered, but your murderer's rage will be drawn from memories of your own extreme anger. Your love scenes will contain hints of your own past kisses and sweet moments.","Without coffee, nothing gets written. Period.","When a story is flying along, and I'm so into it that my 'real' world goes away, it can feel magical. I cease to be, my desk and computer ceases to be, and I am my character in his world. Psychologists call this a 'flow state,' and it's better than publication, money, awards, fame.","Your opening should give the reader a person to focus on. In a short story, this person should turn up almost immediately; he should be integral to the story's main action; he should be an individual, not just a type. In a novel, the main character may take longer to appear: Anna Karenina doesn't show up in her own novel until chapter eighteen.","Words change over time. 'Condescending,' for instance, was once a good thing to be. It meant that a person was willing to interact politely with people of lower social ranks. In Jane Austen's world, a lady praised for her condescension was receiving a sincere compliment.","Readers want to visualize your story as they read it. The more exact words you give them, the more clearly they see it, smell it, hear it, taste it. Thus, a dog should be an 'Airedale,' not just a 'dog.' A taste should not be merely 'good' but 'creamy and sweet' or 'sharply salty' or 'buttery on the tongue.'","If you're writing a thriller, mystery, Western or adventure-driven book, you'd better keep things moving rapidly for the reader. Quick pacing is vital in certain genres. It hooks readers, creates tension, deepens the drama, and speeds things along.","Every story makes a promise to the reader. Actually, two promises, one emotional and one intellectual, since the function of stories is to make us both feel and think.","Many novice writers try to avoid using 'said' by substituting synonyms: 'he uttered,' 'she murmured,' 'he questioned.' It's true that any word repeated too often becomes monotonous, but substitutions for 'said' can be worse than its repetition.","Readers want to see, hear, feel, smell the action of your story, even if that action is just two people having a quiet conversation.","The process, not the results, have to be the reason a writer writes. Otherwise, creating a four-hundred-page novel is just too daunting a task.","The truth is, you have about three paragraphs in a short story, three pages in a novel, to capture that editor's attention enough for her to finish your story.","As a writer, you must know what promise your story or novel makes. Your reader will know.","Pace, like everything else in writing, involves a trade-off. If you're not offering the reader a lot of action to keep her interested, you must offer something else in its stead. Slow pace is ideal for complex character development, detailed description, and nuances of style.","Conflict drives fiction; no one wants to read a four-hundred-page novel in which everything rolls along smoothly.","If you consistently write 'The sun set' rather than 'The sun sank slowly in the bright western sky,' your story will move three times as fast. Of course, there are times you want the longer version for atmosphere - but not many. Wordiness not only kills pace; it bores readers.","How many times have you opened a book, read the first few sentences and made a snap decision about whether to buy it? When it's your book that's coming under this casual-but-critical scrutiny, you want the reader to be instantly hooked. The way to accomplish this is to create compelling opening sentences.","Questions that require answers are what keep readers going - and the place to start raising those questions is with your very first sentence.","The most-asked question when someone describes a novel, movie or short story to a friend probably is, 'How does it end?' Endings carry tremendous weight with readers; if they don't like the ending, chances are they'll say they didn't like the work. Failed endings are also the most common problems editors have with submitted works.","A brief short story may require only a few paragraphs after the climax. On the other hand, in his massive novel 'The World According to Garp,' John Irving's denouement consisted of 10 separate sections, each devoted to an individual character's fate and each almost a story in itself.","A true epilogue is removed from the story in time or space. That's the reason it is called an 'Epilogue'; the label serves to alert the reader that the story itself is over, but we are going to now see a distant result or consequence of that story.","You have considerable choice in how you end your fiction. For all stories, the basic rule is the same: Choose the type of ending that best suits what's gone before.","Even if your novel occurs in an unfamiliar setting in which all the customs and surroundings will seem strange to your reader, it's still better to start with action. The reason for this is simple. If the reader wanted an explanation of milieu, he would read nonfiction. He doesn't want information. He wants a story.","The reader is going to imprint on the characters he sees first. He is going to expect to see these people often, to have them figure largely into the story, possibly to care about them. Usually, this will be the protagonist.","Every drama requires a cast. The cast may be so huge, as in Leo Tolstoy's 'Anna Karenina,' that the author or editor provides a list of characters to keep them straight. Or it may be an intimate cast of two.","Should you create a protagonist based directly on yourself? The problem with this - and it is a very large problem - is that almost no one can view himself objectively on the page. As the writer, you're too close to your own complicated makeup.","Exposition has legitimate uses. It's the most efficient way to summarize background information, including necessary information about a character's history. It can set the stage well for a major dramatized event.","You do not have to dramatize everything. In fact, you usually can't, not without ending up with a half-million-word novel.","If your reader has been given a rousing opening, he will usually then sit still for at least some exposition. But be sure to follow that chunk of telling with one or more dramatized scenes. That's much more effective than being given section after section of telling.","The climax is the place where the opposing forces in your story finally clash. This is true whether those opposing forces are two armies or two values inside a character's soul.","The parallels between a stage and a book are compelling. You, like all authors, create 'characters' in a 'setting' who speak 'dialogue' encased in 'scenes.' Most importantly, you - like the playwright - have an 'audience.'","In general, fiction is divided into 'literary fiction' and 'commercial fiction.' Nobody can definitively say what separates one from the other, but that doesn't stop everybody (including me) from trying. Your book probably will be perceived as one or the other, and that will affect how it is read, packaged and marketed.","For commercial books in a genre, readers' and editors' expectations may be fairly rigid. Some romance lines, for instance, issue fairly detailed writers' guidelines explaining exactly what must happen in a book they publish (and what must not).","Surreal fiction is a sophisticated art form. Events happen divorced from conventional logic, as events in a dream may happen. But unlike dreams, everything in the story contributes to an overall coherent point, impression or emotion.","Slipstream fiction is usually defined as fiction with a contemporary setting in which story elements are mimetic (that is, seem real) - except for one or two eerie strangenesses. Unlike outright fantasy, these are not explained or integrated into an alternate-reality setting.","All nonmimetic fiction is a balancing act between 'reality' and the obviously unreal, with no attempt by the author to make the latter seem like the former. Sometimes it's not an easy tightrope to walk. But when it succeeds, such fiction can brilliantly illuminate the human condition.","There are writers whose first drafts are so lean, so skimpy, that they must go back and add words, sentences, paragraphs to make their fiction intelligible or interesting. I don't know any of these writers.","Words that add no new information or aren't repeated for emphasis are just padding. A sentence may carry three or five or eight of them, each one as unnoticeable as an extra two ounces on your hips but collectively adding up to a large burden of fat.","In fiction, a reaction shot is a brief portrayal of how your character reacts to something that someone else has done. In contrast to more direct character building, your guy doesn't initiate the sequence; he completes it. Exactly how he completes it can tell readers a lot about him.","Overpopulated fiction can be so confusing that readers put the story down. Under-populated novels can seem claustrophobic or boring. You want the right number of characters for your particular work.","Novels have much more space than short stories, which gives you more leeway with the number of characters you can include. Even 'furniture' characters can be described and given speaking parts to develop background or atmosphere.","For the professional writer, stories must be presented as a series of individual scenes, each one dramatized with dialogue and telling descriptions of who is present and what they're all doing.","All writers, in all viewpoints, must choose which information and scenes will be presented, and in which order. In that sense, the author is always represented as a point of view in a work of fiction. His hand can always be detected by the discerning."],"Nancy Lopez":["Doubt yourself and you doubt everything you see. Judge yourself and you see judges everywhere. But if you listen to the sound of your own voice, you can rise above doubt and judgment. And you can see forever.","Great champions have an enormous sense of pride. The people who excel are those who are driven to show the world and prove to themselves just how good they are.","A competitor will find a way to win. Competitors take bad breaks and use them to drive themselves just that much harder. Quitters take bad breaks and use them as reasons to give up. It's all a matter of pride.","Do your best, one shot at a time and then move on. Remember that golf is just a game.","I try to be very modest with what I do. I'm not a frivolous spender.","The simpler I keep things, the better I play.","The pressure makes me more intent about each shot. Pressure on the last few holes makes me play better.","My swing is no uglier than Arnold Palmer's, and it's the same ugly swing every time.","Our players are mad, but it's good mad.","If I get involved in a charity, I really want to be a part of it. I don't want to just put my name on your pamphlet.","I loved junior golf.","I never taught my girls to play golf; they all played softball."],"Nancy Lublin":["Social change isn't something you should do just to help pad a resume. Follow your passion.","When I have a bad day, I dream about opening up a gelato stand on the streets of Sydney, Australia. Doesn't everyone have a random escape fantasy?","I love an underdog. No, I don't necessarily mean the cartoon. I mean like David, as in Goliath, or the Bears, as in The Bad News Bears.","I'm proposing a change: love thy worker-bee. Celebrate the ones who toil without complaint, play on a team, construct the hive, produce the honey... executing the plan!","Do-gooders are easily overlooked. We're supposed to be soft, touchy-feely types, who wear Birkenstocks, compost everything, and write poetry by candlelight.","Simply, I believe the United States should lower the voting age to 17.","Commit yourself to an organization or cause that genuinely fires you up.","I run a charity. If my name pops up in your call ID, chances are I'm about to ask you for something - money, free ad space, your first born. So it is probably no surprise that people often don't take my calls.","I'm an entrepreneur. I'm married to an entrepreneur. So I haven't just sipped the entrepreneurship cool-aid, I bleed this stuff.","Entrepreneurship is the very back bone of our country and what makes us great - we are a nation of founders.","Picking and choosing what kind of love is worth recognizing is an expensive choice. Is discrimination worth that price?","I don't run a non-profit. There are lots of non-profits in America - in Detroit, parts of Wall Street, etc. I run a not for profit. We're a business. The only difference is that instead of selling soap or sneakers, we sell hope and leadership.","For a long time, the for-profit world has told us in the not-for-profit sector to behave more like businesses.","I believe in helping young people rock causes they care about because I was one of those young people... a long time ago.","When I was 23, I founded an organization called Dress for Success, which is now in more than 100 cities in 8 countries and has helped a million women transition from welfare to work.","Young people are this awesome, creative, hopeful untapped resource out there.","Many think kids have lots of time and few responsibilities. And that's just not true. They are stressed and under pressure.","Teens look at cause-related efforts with some scrutiny. They know they are often a target market, but it has to make sense to them.","I don't take fancy vacations. I buy all my jewelry at Claire's. I can't remember the last time I went out to a fancy dinner. My family lives in a modest two-bedroom apartment, and my kids share a bedroom. But I do have one extravagant vice: shoes.","My red patent-leather, 5-inch peep-toe slingbacks are not mere shoes. They are fine art. They make me feel tall. They make me feel sexy. They make me feel powerful. I call them my 'special-day shoes.'","My Christian Louboutins are also one of the secrets to my not-for-profit success. Here's why - and it's something that everyone who manages employees, whether in a for-profit business or a not-for-profit, should keep in mind: A little extravagance goes a long way.","If most people were to take a moment to picture in their minds the average, not-for-profit, save-the-world girl, they... well, they probably wouldn't, because who wants to think about hemp, hairy legs, and Birkenstocks? But I'd rather eat a pair of Birkenstocks than put them on my feet, and I love, love, love my Christian Louboutins."],"Nancy Marchand":["I had spent my childhood making up adventures in my head. Then I realized when I went to acting school that there were adventures written down, and you could learn lines, and you could do the adventures for real, not just in your head.","I'm always very uncomfortable with people. It's something that I get upset with myself for, but that's the way I am. But I love people. And when I'm on the stage, I can embrace people and still feel safe.","There are a lot of different facets to my personality that I don't use all the time in my house, or in everyday life, that I can experience and share when I'm on a stage.","Acting was something I had to do.","I was a very shy, overly big, kind of creepy-looking kid.","I wasn't a glamour-puss, and there were more interesting roles for an actress like me in the theater and in live television."],"Nancy McKeon":["A police force, wherever they are, is made up of amazing people, and I respect them a great deal.","Actually I've never had formal training, I was lucky enough to continue working most of my career and aside from sitting in on a couple of classes, here and there, I basically just use my own instincts.","At the moment I really love listening to the Dave Matthews Band.","I started working at the age of 2, doing commercials and modeling in New York.","I'd never played a cop before, and this particular role with what she is going thru, especially during the first season, covering her alcoholism to her on the job performance, was a great opportunity for me as an actress.","Normally I don't watch myself, because I'm not very objective.","One person I've always wanted to work with who would be an amazing guest star would be James Earl Jones.","Personally I had the opportunity to go on several ride alongs with the LA County Sheriff's Department with some amazing detectives, who were invaluable to me."],"Nancy Meyers":["There's a hardening of the culture. Reality TV has lowered the standards of entertainment. You're left wondering about the legitimacy of relationships. It's probably harder to entertain the same people with a more classic form of writing, and romantic comedies are a classic genre.","Like most struggling writers trying to get their scripts commissioned, I had to do something odd to pay the rent. So, aged 21, I started up my own small cheesecake company in Philadelphia.","Movies don't look hard, but figuring it out, getting the shape of it, getting everybody's character right and having it be funny, make sense and be romantic, it's creating a puzzle. Yes, having been a writer for so long, I have an awareness of when things are going awry, but it doesn't mean I know how to fix them.","I've always been blessed with confidence. I am a glass-half-full person. My first movie, 'Private Benjamin,' got turned down by every studio until the very last one, but I just kept thinking, 'Why are you people not seeing that this is a hit movie? What is wrong with you?'","I'm no actor. And I wasn't like George Lucas or Spielberg, making home movies as a teenager, either. But I would go back and watch certain movies again and again. By the time I saw 'The Graduate' I was aware of how these amazing stories could be told.","My movies are not messed with by the studios.","I don't shoot movies quickly because I get a lot of coverage and a lot of angles, so we have all the pieces in the editing. I do a lot of takes, but it's because I'm looking for something.","Being part of a team helped me so much. I know the fact that there was a man in the room with me all those years made the medicine go down. I had made the companies money. I didn't have to start, like a lot of women, from ground zero. My path was not the same as a woman starting out by herself.","I really wanted to be a writer.","I wasn't the kind of kid like Spielberg or Lucas who knew to go to film school. I didn't know at 12 what I was going to do; it took me until I was about 23. I studied journalism in college, but after school, I got a job in public television and I never worked as a journalist for one moment.","We don't want to be our own niche. We're filmmakers like everybody. How many years in a row are we going to talk about the fact that we make films and we are women? Enough already.","I don't want to be known as the one who makes movies for older people.","I like to eat meals I will remember. Otherwise, what's the point?","I don't diet, I don't do fads, I've just decided to not eat carbs. So no more bread and pasta for the month. I can't live without chocolate, though. I've always got a bar in my handbag. It has to be 72%. Any less and it's too sweet, any more and it's inedible. Like I said, I'm very particular."],"Nancy Mitford":["To fall in love you have to be in the state of mind for it to take, like a disease.","I have only ever read one book in my life, and that is White Fang. It's so frightfully good I've never bothered to read another.","Surely a King who loves pleasure is less dangerous than one who loves glory?","I Love children, especially when they cry for then someone takes them away.","An aristocracy in a republic is like a chicken whose head has been cut off; it may run about in a lively way, but in fact it is dead."],"Nancy O'Dell":["Marc if you want me to go to the bottom of the pool, I'll go there.","I'm so excited and honored to be part of 'Entertainment Tonight!' 'E.T.' was the show that started all the entertainment news, so I couldn't be more thrilled.","Sometimes I will tweet an interview I have coming up and ask my followers what questions they have for the celebrity. I feel that way I can really know first hand what people want to hear answered.","I just love Jamie Foxx!","I love to post behind-the-scenes photos of what is really going on. My twitter friends really seem to like that and the great thing is I can deliver them information right away.","Kids love to look at pictures of themselves.","We play tag and kickball almost every day. It's one of the ways that I've figured out how to spend some fun quality time with my kids while getting exercise.","I like to call it 'album making' because everybody hears the word scrapbooking and thinks, 'All the glue and the glitter - I don't have time for that!'","When I first got married to my husband, he had boxes full of photos of my two stepsons, ages 5 and 8 at the time, and I put them together in some little albums and wrote notes about how happy I was that they were a part of my life.","Family photo albums are so powerful in that they make kids feel valued, cherished and respected.","When you save book reports, art projects and put them in a scrapbook, it shows a kid you care and you are taking an interest in their lives.","To be honest, I haven't had a lot of time off.","You do have to overcome the child's thinking that this new woman, who is not their mother, is going to be in their lives."],"Nancy Pearcey":["Competition is always a good thing. It forces us to do our best. A monopoly renders people complacent and satisfied with mediocrity.","During the first 13 centuries after the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, no one thought of setting up a creche to celebrate Christmas. The pre-eminent Christian holiday was Easter, not Christmas.","America has always welcomed anyone willing to assimilate to its national character. But radical Islam rejects assimilation and is bent on the conquest of our national character.","Beginning under the Roman Empire, intellectual leadership in the West had been provided by Christianity. In the middle ages, who invented the first universities - in Paris, Oxford, Cambridge? The church.","My aim in homeschooling is to give my children the ability to be an adult learner, a skill set that will last the rest of their lives.","Homeschoolers are the ultimate do-it-yourselfers. They are self-motivated and self-directed, independent-minded and creative. They are not content to turn their education of their children over to the government.","America faces a fundamental choice: either the blessings of liberty or the servitude of liberalism. In the political struggle for survival, one or the other is headed for extinction.","The White House should always be a friend to American freedom.","The human mind inherently seeks intelligible order. Thus the conviction that such an order exists to be found is a crucial assumption.","No matter how much you like your local school teacher, he or she is a government agent.","Americans have grown impatient with the relentless politicizing of every area of life.","The genius of the American Founders was to create an intricate system of balanced powers both within the state and between state and society - a system that has fostered unprecedented political, social, and intellectual freedom.","In Gnosticism, the physical world did not ultimately matter - which meant physical suffering did not matter either. Seeking 'enlightenment' meant cultivating an attitude of detachment, even indifference.","Modern secular thought has its own dualism: It treats only the physical world as knowable and testable, while locking everything else - mind, spirit, morality, meaning - into the realm of private, subjective feelings. The so-called fact/value split.","Many journalists are influenced by a myopic multiculturalism that is suspicious of anything Western, while giving the benefit of the doubt to non-Western societies.","Indigenous people have discovered that Christianity is not inherently Western but universal - 'translatable' into any cultural idiom.","We do not create marriage from scratch. Instead, in the elegant language of the marriage ceremony, we 'enter into the holy estate of matrimony.'","The costs of marriage breakdown are borne by the entire society, and therefore it is reasonable for the entire society to demand support for marriage - to insist that it is privileged both culturally and legally.","The defense of marriage is the defense of freedom. Neither of which is obsolete.","Urban areas tend to attract members of the 'knowledge class' - people who work with ideas, data, information.","The Tea Party has imparted political energy to common-sense American constitutionalism.","To be intellectual does not require one to be alienated and oppositional.","Public education grants secular worldviews an exclusive monopoly in the classroom.","Visit a typical science classroom and you will discover far more than empirical facts being taught. The dominant worldview among scientific intellectuals is evolutionary naturalism, which holds that humans are essentially biochemical machines.","Schools ought to teach students to challenge secular ideologies masquerading as science in the classroom.","Literary theory has become a parody of science, generating its own arcane jargon. In the process, tragically, it discourages love of literature for its own sake.","Pro-lifers have long been castigated for bringing private values into the public square. But actually it is the pro-abortion position that is based on merely personal views and values.","If pro-abortionists want to commit intellectual suicide and deny scientific facts, that's their problem. But there's no reason a civilized society should fund their anti-scientific outlook - or accept its inhumane consequences.","America is a knowledge-based society, where information counts as much as material resources. Therefore those with the power to define what qualifies as knowledge - to determine what are the accepted facts - wield the greatest social and political power.","The word 'tolerance' once meant we all have the right to argue rationally for our deepest convictions in the public arena. Now it means those convictions are not even subject to rational debate.","The more we learn about life, the less plausible is any evolutionary theory that relies on blind, undirected, piece-by-piece change."],"Nancy Pelosi":["The president led us into the Iraq war on the basis of unproven assertions without evidence; he embraced a radical doctrine of pre-emptive war unprecedented in our history; and he failed to build a true international coalition.","But we have to pass the bill so you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of the controversy.","Every month that we do not have an economic recovery package 500 million Americans lose their jobs.","Think of an economy where people could be an artist or a photographer or a writer without worrying about keeping their day job in order to have health insurance.","We have so much room for improvement. Every aspect of our lives must be subjected to an inventory... of how we are taking responsibility.","America will be far safer if we reduce the chances of a terrorist attack in one of our cities than if we diminish the civil liberties of our own people.","The American dream is about freedom.","I don't care how popular I am. I'm not putting myself out there to run for higher office.","I really want women to know their power, to value their experience. To understand that nothing has been more wholesome in the political process than the increased involvement of women.","I think about my parents all the time, especially on Sunday when I'm at Mass. My mother always said, 'We do not pray to win elections. We pray for people's health, we pray that God's will be done, we pray that we do our best. But we do not pray to win elections.'","Don't underestimate your opponent, but don't overestimate them, either.","Raising the minimum wage is the right thing to do, but it's a popular thing to do as well.","Americans deserve a better tomorrow, today.","America must be a light to the world, not just a missile.","Freedom is secured every day by our men and women in uniform. We must build a future worthy of their sacrifice.","In our recovery package we put new standards of accountability and transparency, which we hope will now apply.","Being the first woman speaker and breaking the marble ceiling is pretty important. Now it's time to move on.","Democratic priorities remain clear: to provide a tax cut for working families, to promote policies that produce jobs and economic growth, and to assist millions of our fellow Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own.","If you make - not have - $1 million a year, should you not participate in the sense of community of our country? I'm willing to put that on the table.","My brother is the former mayor of Baltimore.","We are not going back to the failed policies of the past. We are fighting for the middle class!","After over 200 years, not even a fifth of Congress is women.","I read that my lifelong dream is to serve as speaker with Hillary Clinton as president. So what?","The country needs more than one-party dominance, as much as I believe the Democratic Party is the party for the middle class... We need to have a marketplace of ideas.","My husband and I, when we had our five children and they were grown, we thought we were entitled to grandchildren. And so we were just expecting this to happen; of course, nothing was happening. And then we kept begging, bribing, cajoling, anything - threatening to adopt our own grandchildren - and finally, we got some grandchildren.","The impact of climate change is a tremendous risk to the security and well-being of our countries.","We in Congress stand by Israel. In Congress, we speak with one voice on the subject of Israel.","We haven't really gotten the credit for what we have done.","What we're discussing privately and publicly, is a budget which is a blueprint for the future which creates jobs, which educates our children, which provides healthcare for all Americans, which takes our deficit down, which gives a tax cut for 95% of the American people.","I say to my colleagues never confine your best work, your hopes, your dreams, the aspiration of the American people to what will be signed by George W. Bush because that is too limiting a factor.","With President Obama, we will move America forward.","If you don't vote, you don't count.","The war on terror is the war in Afghanistan.","My father was in Congress when I was born. He was mayor my whole life from when I was in grade school - first grade - to when I went away to college.","Putin is going to do what Putin is going to do.","I don't know any member of Congress who ever said, 'I'm satisfied with the communication that we have from the White House.'","I would never think of crying about any loss of an office, because that's always a possibility, and if you're professional, then you deal with it professionally.","The American people voted to restore integrity and honesty in Washington, D.C., and the Democrats intend to lead the most honest, most open and most ethical Congress in history.","Let's just do what is right for the American people. And those of us who are involved in politics and government know that our responsibility is to the American people, that we have a responsibility to find our common ground, to seek it and to find it.","When I first ran for Congress, I went to my daughter Alexandra, who was going to be a senior in high school, and said: 'I have a chance to run. I may not win, but I'd be gone three nights a week. So, if you want me to stay, I'll be happy to.' And do you know what she said to me? 'Mother, get a life!'","I have absolutely no regret about my vote against this war. The same questions remain. The cost in human lives, the cost to our budget, probably 100 billion. We could have probably brought down that statue for a lot less.","Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process.","I will not be making appointments to a committee that is not bipartisan.","Social Security has never failed to pay promised benefits, and Democrats will fight to make sure that Republicans do not turn a guaranteed benefit into a guaranteed gamble.","My biggest fight has been between those who wanted to do something incremental and those who wanted to do something comprehensive. We won that fight, and once we kick through this door, there'll be more legislation to follow.","Bipartisanship is nice, but it cannot be a substitute for action, not having it cannot prevent us from going forward.","I have deep emotions about the American people. If I were to cry for anything, I would cry for them and the policies that they're about to face.","We're sad about some of the losses of members of great seniority and distinction in the Congress, and some very new members, who will no longer be serving with us.","I have newspapers coming to me and saying, 'Can we get in on the TARP?'.","With Americans worried about losing their jobs, their savings, their homes and their chance at the American Dream, the New Direction Congress will work in a bipartisan way to lift our economy and help America's middle class.","If I cry, it's about the personal loss of a friend or something like that. But when it comes to politics - no, I don't cry.","I must have good genes from my parents because I feel no slowdown of energy, enthusiasm or even memory.","For 25 years, it has been my privilege to represent the city of San Francisco and the great state of California; to work to strengthen our vibrant middle class; to secure opportunity and equality.","Democrats believe in reigniting the American dream by removing barriers to success and building ladders of opportunity for all, so everyone can succeed.","Jobs are central to the American dream - and President Obama has focused on jobs from day one.","Jobs mean freedom for workers to support their families.","Democrats believe we must create jobs, not protect the special interests; build the economy from the middle out, not the top down.","Republicans support opening the floodgates to special interest money and suppressing the right to vote. It's just plain wrong.","I never dread going back to Congress.","The name 'Republican' in some ways has been hijacked by obstructionists.","I've never walked away from any of my positions. I take pride in them.","I was pampered in the fact that I had five older brothers, which I highly recommend to anyone.","They're anti-government ideologues who dominate the Republican Party.","I love having the support of my caucus. We have a good working relationship.","My vision for the future always centers around our children - it always centers around our children. So anytime anybody asks me what are the three most important issues facing the Congress, I always say the same thing: 'Our children, our children, our children.'","I always saw politics as an expansion of my role as a mom.","I would say that one of the things that encouraged me so much when I became elected to the leadership was the letters I received from fathers of daughters, saying that, 'My daughter can now do many more things because of what you did.'","What the Republicans have said is rather than touch one hair on the heads of the wealthiest people in our country, people who make over $1 million a year, they're saying, 'Seniors should pay $6,000 more dollars a year. But please don't let us ask the wealthiest to do their fair share.'","Democrats embrace The Affordable Care Act. We're very proud of it.","I do believe that during the Bush-Cheney administration, that Vice President Cheney set a tone and an attitude for the CIA.","As you may know, I was raised in an Italian Catholic family in Baltimore, Maryland.","Washington and Congress are steeped in history and tradition, and that's been very male-oriented.","The beauty of the Democratic Party is in the mix.","I call Washington 'the city of the perishable.'","I had a friend who was getting married. I said, 'You're getting married - I didn't know about all this!' She said, 'I need health benefits.'","I think that much of the truth has been withheld from the American people.","I don't know that anybody has walked up to me in the street or in a store or in the grocery and said to me, 'I hope you bomb Assad.' Certainly plenty have said, 'No; thumbs down, thumbs down, thumbs down.'","My father died the year I was elected to Congress: 1987.","My husband and I have season tickets to the Giants games, and we go there as fans to enjoy it.","I went to Catholic school throughout my whole academic life. In fact, my children - my husband and I and our children in my own family now have over 100 years of Catholic education among us.","Presidents and speakers for over 100 years had tried to pass affordable care for all Americans. It was challenged over and over. The Supreme Court declared it constitutional.","I have a few uniforms - depending on whether I'm going to a college campus or meeting a head of state. But clean and easy works best for me.","Politicians are trying to attract people to issues.","A successful marriage is a decision. You decide it's going to work. You can't always be there, but you have to be there enough. And you have to make sure you are where you're needed most.","If people don't have a job, they're not too interested in how you intend for them to have a job. They want to see results.","The Republican Party is the Grand Old Party. It's made enormous contributions to the success of our country. And it is a party that has embraced its leadership role when it has had the majority or the White House.","As I view the Republicans in Congress, I don't see them as a real reflection of many Republicans in our country.","While we may argue about the size of government, the Republican Party has not been a party that says, 'I want to destroy government.'","I know about raising money.","Tom Foley was a statesman, and it was a privilege to serve under him when he was the Speaker of the House. He loved our country. He was a gentleman. I had the privilege of seeing him a couple days before he passed away.","Nothing surprises me. One thing I don't ever have in my world is surprise.","Let me just say as one who has been speaker of the House, I've had to have a very thick skin about every kind of thing that was thrown at me.","I don't spend a lot of time thinking about the ratings of Congress. I really don't.","I had five children in six years. The day I brought my fifth baby home, that week, my daughter turned 6.","When taxpayers are subsidizing low wages, people should be aware of that. We're subsidizing an economy. We're not subsidizing people. They are doing a hard day's work. When we're not rewarding work actively, there's something wrong with the system.","Stephen Colbert used to be my friend. I even signed the poor baby's cast when he hurt his hand.","The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting president in all of U.S. history."],"Nancy Pickard":["I've known a lot of cowboys and a few cowgirls. They're, by and large, some of the smartest, funniest, most courteous, generous, and hardest-working people you'd ever want to know.","Poisonous frogs feast on insects that don't even have names. Tropical lizards disappear into the cracks of trees whose branches spread out as wide as their trunks climb high. This is the real Florida, as it was before people, and probably will be after us, too.","I've lived in Kansas for more than thirty years, and for half of those, I was part of a ranching family, so I'm writing about things I know and love.","I often feel like not writing! Sometimes I overcome it by just sitting there until writing happens. Sometimes I don't write, because books often need periods of percolation.","I go for drives in the Flint Hills, which is the setting for 'The Virgin of Small Plains'.","I love the unexplainable. It would be so boring to me if everything could be explained.","I live in a little suburb close to Kansas City called Prairie Village, where there's a feeling of everybody knowing everybody else. I think the same thing is true of New York City, by the way.","I'm a Midwestern girl, born and bred. It's harder for some of us to write about things closer to home. It's not so much a fear of telling the truth but wanting to do it justice.","I'm not interested in forcing my beliefs on my readers.","It's such a joy to talk to a roomful of people who have read my novel and are eager to talk about it.","I'm Marie Lightfoot, or at least that's the name my publisher puts on the covers of the books I write about true crime. In classic 'true crime' fashion, my latest one is titled 'Anything to Be Together.'","Everybody knows now that Marie Lightfoot, the true crime writer, is dating Franklin DeWeese, the state attorney of Howard County, Florida. They know I'm a white woman; they know he's a black man. That's not news anymore.","Being a writer - even a best-selling one - is usually not anywhere near as public as being a movie star, at least not when I'm out in 'real life' like this. Not that I don't use what fame I have, every chance I get, to help sell more books."],"Nancy Reagan":["To my young friends out there: Life can be great, but not when you can't see it. So, open your eyes to life: to see it in the vivid colors that God gave us as a precious gift to His children, to enjoy life to the fullest, and to make it count. Say yes to your life.","There's a big, wonderful world out there for you. It belongs to you. It's exciting and stimulating and rewarding. Don't cheat yourselves out of this promise.","I do not believe in abortion at will. I do not believe that if a woman just wants to have an abortion she should... I do believe if you have an abortion you are committing murder.","I believe that people would be alive today if there were a death penalty.","Now science has presented us with a hope called stem cell research, which may provide our scientists with many answers that have for so long been beyond our grasp.","When people say, 'You have Alzheimer's,' you have no idea what Alzheimer's is. You know it's not good. You know there's no light at the end of the tunnel. That's the only way you can go. But you really don't know anything about it. And you don't know what to expect.","I'm against abortion. On the other hand, I believe in a woman's choice.","I'm fine, except, you know, I broke my pelvis. And that's not much fun.","Embryonic stem cell research has the potential to alleviate so much suffering. Surely, by working together we can harness its life-giving potential.","As I've said before, time is short, and life is precious.","I am a big believer that eventually everything comes back to you. You get back what you give out.","Feminism is the ability to choose what you want to do.","I've found a letter that was written to me from a girl who was getting married. And she wanted to know the secret of a happy marriage. I said - and I wrote back and said something to the effect that I couldn't - I had no magic formula. And I never sat down and thought about it, but everything just fell into place with Ronnie and me.","Just say no to drugs!","With Alzheimer's patients, you have to be very careful what you say when you're looking at them over their bed. Because once in a while, they understand it.","I must say acting was good training for the political life which lay ahead for us.","You learn something out of everything, and you come to realize more than ever that we're all here for a certain space of time, and, and then it's going to be over, and you better make this count.","You just get up each day and put one foot in front of the other and go. You know, each day is different.","From the moment I walked into the White House, it was as if I had no privacy at all.","I have been very happy with my homes, but homes really are no more than the people who live in them.","There is no job description for the first lady and she's only there because her husband got elected president.","I always liked red. It's a picker-upper.","It is well known that my husband and Lady Thatcher enjoyed a very special relationship as leaders of their respective countries during one of the most difficult and pivotal periods in modern history. Ronnie and Margaret were political soul mates, committed to freedom and resolved to end Communism.","Everything just fell into place with Ronnie and me. We completed each other.","A lot of what acting is paying attention.","I don't talk about political matters. That's not my department.","I don't think most people associate me with leeches or how to get them off. But I know how to get them off. I'm an expert at it.","I think a woman gets more if she acts feminine.","The movies were custard compared to politics.","I don't intend for this to take on a political tone. I'm just here for the drugs.","My life really began when I married my husband.","I see the first lady as another means to keep a president from becoming isolated.","I don't really yell at people.","I don't like a lot of frills and fusses.","I've always gone for the more understated look.","People don't understand that all presidents, the minute they become president, get a knock at the door. And there's a man there saying, 'Let's talk about your funeral.' At the time I thought, God, that's a terrible thing. Later on, I thought it was pretty wise.","I thought Obama ran the best campaign I have ever known - disciplined, well organised, very, very good. I was very impressed.","For eight years, I was sleeping with the president, and if that doesn't give you special access, I don't know what does!","I don't know when I'm going to have time to be politically active.","I said from the very beginning, I don't want a big house, I don't want big grounds, I don't want the trouble with the maintenance and all of that.","I'm very grateful that President Obama has lifted the restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.","I urge researchers to make use of the opportunities that are available to them and to do all they can to fulfill the promise that stem cell research offers.","A lot of business can be accomplished in the state dinners.","Remember, I'm a doctor's daughter. So obviously I'm interested in all medical things.","You know, the polls show that 70 percent of the people are for stem-cell research.","I've had quite a life, when you stop and think about it.","It's always written that my father was a rich, conservative John Bircher. That is untrue. He was not rich. He was not a John Bircher.","My mother was a Democrat - southern Democrat, y'all.","I'm particularly happy that the Ronald Reagan Building is both public and private, and embraces his lifelong belief... in free and open trade.","I couldn't possibly lead the kind of life I lead, and keep the schedule that I do, having radiation or chemotherapy.","I chose to have a career, and I enjoyed it while I had it.","I'm doing what I want to do.","I was the one who was always calling people.","I have been criticized and ridiculed for turning to astrology, but after a while, I reached the point where I didn't care.","I was doing everything I could think of to protect my husband and keep him alive.","It is true that when you're in the White House alone, it is a lonely place. Big and lonely.","I rarely think about myself that much. I really don't.","My job is being 'Mrs. Ronald Reagan.'","I voted for McCain. But I thought Obama ran the best campaign I have ever known - disciplined, well organized, very, very good. I was very impressed.","My life began with Ronnie.","Don't say I was tough. I was strong. I had to be, because Ronnie liked everybody and sometimes didn't see - or refused to see - what the people around him were really up to. But everything I did, I did for Ronnie. I did for love."],"Nancy Roman":["I still remember asking my high school guidance teacher for permission to take a second year of algebra instead of a fifth year of Latin. She looked down her nose at me and sneered, 'What lady would take mathematics instead of Latin?'","Looking through the atmosphere is somewhat like looking through a piece of old, stained glass. The glass has defects in it, so the image is blurred from that.","One of the reasons I like working with schools is to try to convince women that they can be scientists and that science can be fun.","I believe that there will be women astronauts sometime just as there are women airplane pilots.","A few months after NASA was formed, I was asked if I knew anyone who would like to set up a program in space astronomy.","All of the stars rotate, have orbits around the center of the galaxy, and most of them go around the center of the galaxy in nearly circular orbits. They vary a little bit from circular, but they're predominantly circular.","My career was quite unusual, so my main advice to someone interested in a career similar to my own is to remain open to change and new opportunities. I like to tell students that the jobs I took after my Ph.D. were not in existence only a few years before.","One of the primary ways that astronomers study stars is to spread their light out into a rainbow, which we call a spectrum, and from that rainbow, we can learn something about what the stars are composed of and how hot they are, how bright they are, and how they're moving, at least how they're moving toward or away from us.","I was scheduled to graduate from high school in 1943, but I was in a course that was supposed to give us four years of high school plus a year of college in our four years. So by the end of my junior year, I would have had enough credits to graduate from high school.","It was probably my parents who inspired me most. My father was a scientist and answered my scientific questions, while my mother took me on walks and showed me birds and plants. She also took me out at night and showed me the constellations and the aurora.","I was born in Nashville, Tenn., but I have lived in a number of places. In 1937, I moved to Baltimore, Md., where I attended junior high and high school. I lived there for five years before leaving for college.","I had never used the prefix 'Dr.' with my name, but when I started with NASA, I had to. Otherwise, I could not get past the secretaries.","We live in a technical society.","Certainly by the time I was in seventh grade, I knew I had to have a long education if I wanted to become an astronomer, but I figured I'd try it, and if I didn't get far enough, I could always end up teaching in high school or math or physics.","At Swarthmore, the Dean of Women was very opposed to women going into science or engineering - so opposed that if she couldn't talk a girl out of it, she just never had anything more to do with her for the four years she was there.","I had left teaching, which I enjoyed, because I realized I couldn't get tenure at a research university.","I wondered had I really oversold the Hubble. I have to admit that, since, I have been convinced that I didn't.","I do not remember exactly when I became interested in astronomy, but I know it was at a very young age. I did organize an astronomy club for my friends at the age of 11. We would meet once a week to learn about the constellations.","The first year I was at NASA, I was only responsible for optical and ultraviolet astronomy. Frankly, there wasn't much else.","You cannot exploit the advantages of getting above the atmosphere unless you are able to get up there reasonably large-sized telescopes and unless you are able to keep these telescopes pointing at one region of the sky for long periods of time to a high degree of accuracy.","Many societal problems concern science, such as the energy crisis, genetic alterations of foods.","Most kids at 10 or 11 love science, but I never outgrew it.","The exciting results from the Hubble, other satellites and probes would not have been possible without innovative solutions to many technical problems.","Just as the lunar landings inspired many young people to consider careers in space and related fields, the solution of the challenging instrumentation problems presented in space science can inspire young people to push beyond the current state of the art.","In 1956, I received an invitation to a dedication of an observatory in the Soviet Union, in Soviet Armenia, as a guest of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.","I started out, as most astronomers do, with a university job. But in my generation, women weren't very welcome at universities, and so I found a job in the government. And the government was appreciably more welcoming."],"Nancy Sinatra":["I think I've finally proven something to people who were cynical about me. Because they were cruel.","I think most people are aware of the garbage in the tabloids and don't give them a lot of credence.","I am the daughter of the Chairman of the Board and thus, was raised with great music.","There are a lot of people who would laugh at the idea of me being a good singer.","After 50, the rock 'n' roll road is a little absurd. It's very difficult to play these little places. You're out there on a rickety old bus with no place to shower.","After things started to happen here, my choice of material was extremely limited. It was a weird situation.","Dad really had little to do with the songs, except to perform them.","Frank's audience doesn't care if a girl singer, a comic or an organ grinder with a monkey opens the show. They are there to see HIM.","His last 2 shows in the U.S. were in Chicago and St. Louis. I don't know what made me go on the trip with him, but I'm so very glad I did. They were two of the finest concerts I've ever seen.","I didn't just want to be Frank's daughter who sang Boots. I take my music very seriously and studied very hard. It's not a joke to me.","I have never been accepted. I'll never make the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They're never going to let me in.","I wanted to travel with my dad to be close to him again. Having babies and raising my own family took so much of my time, I didn't have a chance to be with him very often.","I was a star in Italy, Austrailia, Germany and Japan before the American stations ever paid attention at all.","I was at a party three weeks prior to the murders at Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate's house.","I was singing about six notes higher than I had to, in a range that kept me up in a bubblegum sound.","I was successful with mediocre material because of a good recording voice that people really liked at that time.","I wasn't allowed to grow as an artist. My albums were nicer to look at than to listen to.","It would be nice to be on the charts again, nice to be recognised.","Morrissey wrote a really gorgeous song for me. I'm crazy for that man. And he thinks I'm hip!","Morrissey wrote to me and said, I have a song for you and if we release it as a single, you'll be on the charts for the first time since 1972, I said, what time, where?","The one hit song that I have tremendous gratitude for is Boots, because it has a life of its own. It's like being identified with a brand name.","Then all of a sudden, Quentin Tarantino comes along and puts a song from 40 years ago in one of his films and they've suddenly discovered you. That was a real gift that Quentin gave me.","What happens in the music business is that if you step out of your little spot to do something else, the sand falls right into where you stood and you're gone, you're history."],"Nancy Thayer":["It's never too late - in fiction or in life - to revise.","No one knows how it is that with one glance a boy can break through into a girl's heart.","The universe is always speaking to us... sending us little messages, causing coincidences and serendipities, reminding us to stop, to look around, to believe in something else, something more."],"Nancy Travis":["I love zoo sanctuaries.","To wait for hours to buy a train ticket or to see a doctor is accepted as a normal way of doing things. Privacy is not a great preoccupation, and this is a very crowded country.","The alarming thing in China is the almost total absence of primary care. Even in cities, there are no independent doctors' offices or neighborhood clinics, so people have to go to the hospital for every health care need.","I really enjoy doing sitcom television. It allows me to stay in Los Angeles and spend more time with my husband and kids.","'The Bill Engvall Show' is a comedy about a middle-class family in the Midwest. It's a great family show to watch if you want to laugh and unwind.","I wish my real life could be as simple and scripted as it is on television.","I've probably said that in every feature I've been in. I've been repeatedly defined as the girlfriend or wife.","I want to do a show about a woman who's juggling a career with a relationship."],"Nancy Wake":["I hate wars and violence but if they come then I don't see why we women should just wave our men a proud goodbye and then knit them balaclavas.","I've always got on very well with the French, perhaps because I'm very natural.","I adored my father."],"Nancy Werlin":["I used to want covers that represented the book's contents very closely and were also pretty. Many folks automatically believe that this is what makes a good cover. But I've changed my mind about this. While the cover should not lie (by implication or outright), its job is simply to say: 'Pick me up!' to someone who might like the book.","Going back to my own past as a reader, I was a big, big reader of romances, particularly as a teenager, the age that my books are aimed at.","I actually hope people don't react to 'Impossible' in a way where they think it's terribly retro. The plot needed to do what it needed to do. But I'm a little surprised to find myself looking a little bit like an advocate of teen marriage. It takes some exceptional circumstances for that to be a reasonable idea.","I do seem to have a lot of family secrets in my novels. I guess I'm one of those writers who is often writing about the same sort of themes, but taking different angles on them.","You start thinking about a character in a new book, of course you're going to think pretty soon, 'Well, what's their secret? What is their problem?' Maybe, 'What is their secret?' is another way of saying, 'What is their problem?' There's got to be some issue, or you've got a totally boring book!","There was a mission: To match the cover of 'Extraordinary' to the cover of the paperback 'Impossible,' which was commercially successful. Consider the outdoor natural setting, the single girl in motion with her hair blowing, and the cursive font used for the title; both covers have these in common.","'Extraordinary' is an original fairy tale, a contemporary story. But like a traditional fairy tale, it heads quickly into frightening, bloody territory. I am afraid for my book, as it goes out alone into the world, just as I was frightened for Phoebe as I wrote and rewrote her story.","No matter how beautiful and loved a cover may be, the jury on it remains uncommitted until the book has been in the world for a while. Perhaps bookstore buyers will be indifferent. Perhaps it will be lost on store shelves. Perhaps there's another book or two out there using the same or a similar photo."],"Nancy Willard":["Armenian folklore has it that three apples fell from Heaven: one for the teller of a story, one for the listener, and the third for the one who 'took it to heart.' What a pity Heaven awarded no apple to the one who wrote the story down.","Jean Piaget observed that scarcely any question seems absurd to a child, but he was silent on the question of absurd answers from adults.","In Jenny Offill's remarkable first novel, 'Last Things,' 7-year-old Grace Davitt watches her mother, Anna, descend into madness and tries to make sense of the claustrophobic world that Anna has created for her.","When I was growing up, I loved stories in which a girl sets out on a quest to rescue the prince instead of the other way around."],"Nandan Nilekani":["Privacy is a vast subject. Also, remember that privacy and convenience is always a trade-off. When you open a bank account and want to borrow some money, and you want to get a very cheap loan, you'll share all details of your assets because you want them to give you a low interest rate.","Slowly, ideas lead to ideology, lead to policies that lead to actions.","When India got independence, entrepreneurs were seen as a bad lot, as people who would exploit.","I am not in politics to make more money.","It's because Gandhi believed in villages and because the British ruled from the cities; therefore, Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city.","Indian higher education is completely regulated. It's very difficult to start a private university. It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India. As a result of that, our higher education is simply not keeping pace with India's demands. That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address.","My parents were concerned that I would not get good schooling, so they put me up in my uncle's house in Dharwad, and I spent about six years there. So at a very young age, I was away from my parents. I developed an amount of independence and learned to stand on my own feet.","Infosys was going to be a different type of company. It was going to be very ethically run, meritocratic, quality-conscious, transparent. People didn't confuse the personal with the corporate.","I think politics is the biggest lever of change in India.","Congress is my ideological home; I come from a Nehruvian family.","I don't decide my politics based on the flavour of the month.","I'm in politics to make the lives of millions of Indians better.","I think the ideology of the Congress is closest to mine. Congress is a party where I should be. I have joined politics to bring change in society. The Congress gave me a chance with the Aadhaar project. It's a party that will allow me to bring change.","You don't choose a party because it's the flavour of the month. I feel I will be able to work under a political system. I feel if people like me don't enter politics to bring change, who will?","Bangalore needs a honest, passionate and hard-working MP, and I will be that MP.","We took Infosys public. That was a nonstop three-week global roadshow.","My background is putting in large systems that change lives... The right kind of systems can bring honesty and efficiency.","I made my money in an honest way. And I have declared it all. By co-founding Infosys along with Mr. Murthy and others, I earned financially.","My transactions are above board: I do not have money deposited in other accounts and have transparently declared all assets. My real wealth is, however, my experience as cofounder of Infosys and as Aadhar Chairman, which gave away 60,000 crore identity cards to people of India as promised.","The biggest thing the money Infosys brought me is the freedom to do what I want. And what I want is to give millions more the opportunities I had.","I am proud of the fact that my wealth is completely transparent.","Bangalore now wants a person who doesn't only play politics. Bangalore needs a problem solver, and I am a problem solver. I will be the bridge between Bangalore and the Centre."],"Nanette Lepore":["It's so easy for me to get caught up in the feeling of a city like Venice, where everything is just beautiful color and gorgeous buildings that are so peaceful. You can roam around and get lost in the labyrinth.","It's just fun to be in Paris.","I've always wanted to tackle the casual part of dressing. Knits to me are always just easy. I've fantasized about packing a suitcase of only knits: You just throw them in, roll them in a ball, pull them out and they still look fabulous.","I really love to resurrect pieces from my past collections and wear them to fashion week parties.","I think I would like to have lived in the 1930s and worn beautiful bias cut dresses all the time.","The Thirties are a great mix of everyday glamour and something a bit more practical."],"Naomi Alderman":["When a marriage founders, this may well be cause for tremendous sadness, but it's not a failure of spirit or character. People change, their goals and dreams alter, their ideas of themselves grow, or they just meet someone they like better.","Utopias and dystopias can exist side by side, even in the same moment. Which one you're in depends entirely on your point of view.","Personal trainers, however nice, give me PE teacher flashbacks.","The gaming world isn't filled only with violence and depravity. In fact, it's mostly enchanting.","Gaming is our cultural bogeyman - we blame it for everything from child obesity to violence to short attention spans. But any explanation that fits every situation ultimately explains nothing.","I hate to be one of those people who forwards links to 'hilarious pictures' or 'brilliant games' to half their contacts database.","More choice doesn't make us happy, and we understand that no one has infinite choices about how to live life.","It's absolutely delightful to get dressed up for a lovely evening, but when it goes from being a fun thing to being a chore, and a chore that men don't have to do, then we need to think about it differently.","If gaming were seen as an art, the important question would be not whether games are good for us but whether they are good, full stop.","As a gamer, I can't think of anything more annoying for everyone concerned than playing games in a shared living room.","Expect to be disgusted by your own early work. If writing is your vocation, if you hope that it might be your salvation, push on through the disgust until you find one true sentence, a few words that say more than you expected, something you didn't know until you set it down.","No human quality belongs to only one class of person. We all get to be both aggressive and loving. We all get to delight in our careers and revel in our children. We're all kind and brave, soft and hard, sciency and artsy, interested in being looked at and in admiring others' physical form. Everything.","Writers of feminist dystopian fiction are alert to the realities that grind down women's lives, that make the unthinkable suddenly thinkable.","People who were always hardbodies love that competitive style of team-sports activity: they come up with timers and fitness contests and personal bests. But for the vast majority of people, competition in exercise is not fun. It's no fun to compete if you know you can never win.","We urgently need to address the assumption bound up in our employment laws and custody arrangements that women are the 'natural child carers' and men don't really want much to do with their children.","Let's teach boys at school the personally and economically valuable skills of self-expression and emotional intelligence, of mediation and problem-solving.","Traditions are always puzzling to those who don't share them. I'm Jewish, so the idea of a 'perfect family Christmas' is foreign to me.","For millennia, human beings have been finding new ways to look at the world through each others' eyes: from projecting ourselves onto the characters in novels or movies to dressing up in costume to devouring the details of some celebrity's life in 'Hello' or 'OK.'","One of the hardest challenges posed by the modern world is how to deal with abundance. It's even harder to confront because admitting that it's a problem seems spoiled.","I feel powerful when I'm onstage talking to an audience. I like communicating; it feels like my calling in the world. Knowing what you're meant to be doing with your life is pretty bloody powerful.","The species will continue, whatever apocalypse we manage to unleash. It just won't be much fun to live through.","It's hard to describe why one room and not another feels right for writing. Of course you have to train yourself to be able to write anywhere, but it's nice to feel that each book has a place that belongs to it, where it's home.","Our culture tends to denigrate things that are associated with women. It's OK for women to wear trousers, for example, but not OK for men to wear skirts.","Claude Cahun is a fascinating artist - one of the few women to be part of the surrealist movement, she and her partner Suzanne Malherbe took on men's names and made artworks that investigated female identity long before 'The Second Sex' or Cindy Sherman.","I find the sneeriness about 'selfie-culture' quite boring - I'm excited by young people taking control of their own images and finding out for themselves how much Photoshop has done for models.","It's very easy for a writer to spend much too much time in her head.","No one in tech has ever been as sexist toward me as teachers and rabbis before I was 12 years old.","In general, I'd rather ask questions and look stupid than keep quiet and not understand what someone's talking about.","I've been paid less than men I worked with who contributed less to the project.","The truth is, none of us is OK, not really. The best, most dear, most thoughtful and engaged and open and feminist men in my life have occasionally come out with some statement that's made me gasp. Then again, so have almost all the women.","I hated sports at school. Almost everyone did.","I get migraines. I've had them all my life; so has my dad. So did his grandmother, although back then they called them 'sick headaches.'","It is a very different feeling to be in a fat body that is moving a lot to one that hardly moves at all. It feels like love. As simple and as joyful as that.","I'd been to an Orthodox Jewish primary school where, every morning, the boys said, 'Thank you God for not making me a woman.' If you put that together with 'The Handmaid's Tale' in your head, something will eventually go fizz! Boom!","I listen to terrible music when exercising. I mean, like, early Madonna, Boney M, the Fratellis, Shakira... I can't claim interesting musical taste.","I really hope that men read 'The Power' and watch 'The Handmaid's Tale' and read 'The Handmaid's Tale.'","I hope that there are many more women out there writing bits of feminist sci-fi. And men, also - men are allowed to write feminist things.","I was there on 9/11. I watched the towers falling from my office window, at which point I decided I would give up my job at a law firm in Manhattan and come back to the U.K.","I find it particularly irritating, if I go to a games conference to speak about my work, that often it's presumed that I'm the marketing girl - that's annoying.","I had a year of panic attacks. I was feeling really pressured, like I could never do it again. With a first novel, you put things on hold because it takes so much mental energy and self-belief to keep on writing.","After the novel was published, I came to feel that I couldn't call myself Orthodox anymore. It's so patriarchal, anti-women, anti-gay. There was something about writing 'Disobedience'... it felt like I had put it all in the book. I had done my best by it, recorded what it meant for me. I felt I was done.","I was incredibly inspired by Oprah Winfrey as a young woman.","The worst things that ever happened to me were before I was 20. It has been slow, hard-won improvement since then.","I've got the brain for systems and a head for figures.","I grew up an Orthodox Jew, and now I'm not an Orthodox Jew. So I have sympathy for people who lose their faith.","I am a geek, and proud of it.","There's some really good stuff in the way I was brought up. There's some really rubbish stuff as well.","I suppose the idea about all Orthodox religion is that it's a kind of submission, obedience.","I don't think I have any particular problem with God.","The demands of having to be 'masculine' are as damaging to men as the demands of having to be 'feminine' are to women. I wish we could all agree just to wash it all away. Begin again.","I used to think there was something cheap in trying to make beautiful sentences. Now I think language has its own ways and ends, and it does one's thinking good to try to serve them. Beauty isn't truth. But a certain kind of clear beauty will help in the pursuit of truth.","My parents are both intellectuals and readers; my mother would take me to the library every few days from before I was one year old.","I was reading the Bible in Hebrew from a very young age, so that'll shape ideas about how words can move the world.","You can't write a thing that is hermetically sealed; there has to be a way for the audience to get in and participate. I think that's a massively valuable discipline for any artist.","I've always been a reader of science fiction, and I have loved a lot of feminist science fiction.","I've always had a real interest in the way that science fiction can portray a world that could be different to our world, which I find a really exciting thought.","I think when I was 7, at school they got us all to write the story of Joseph and his brothers. I got a bit carried away and wrote 12 pages - everybody else wrote a page. The teacher was so impressed by it that she put it up on the wall for parents' evening. I thought, 'Oh, this is something that I really like that I also seem to be quite good at.'","When I was 19, I wrote a novel, which was not very good, but I finished it.","If I'm working every day, it's like pumping a pump. When you start, rusty water comes out, and then it runs clear. I do it even if I get completely stuck.","For years, I looked down on my mother for shopping at Asda, and now I feel very ashamed of it.","I think some people's brains have more of a natural bent towards God than others.","I have a suspicion of lockstep and everyone looking in the same direction: that's a key character trait in me.","Attending a book group is always a salutary experience for a writer. There's no guarantee that the people there will have enjoyed your book, and, as anyone who has taken part in a book group will know, half the fun is in ripping a book you haven't liked to shreds.","I got my first library card, for Hendon Library in north London, when I was two years old.","The value of the arts cannot be measured by its ability to preserve life but rather to enhance existence.","Just as readers often turn into writers, novel-writers often become novel-reviewers.","Computer games can be works of art and literature - they're still developing. The stories they can tell, and the experiences they provide, are increasingly sophisticated and glorious.","While 'Iron Man' is tremendous fun, it's another reminder of the pressure on all of us to make ourselves increasingly perfect and a little less human. And that is something it is important to resist.","Twitter's strength - and its weakness - is that it makes it extremely easy to share every passing thought with everyone on your friends list.","I honestly can't think of many more truly romantic gestures than a really well-thought-through prenuptial agreement.","We human beings get nervous if we don't know what's going on. It's the rule for creating scary stories: the unknown is always more frightening than the known.","What makes 'The Handmaid's Tale' so terrifying is that everything that happens in it is plausible.","The politics of fear are always the same. They are easily recognisable in retrospect. They are easy to acquiesce in at the time.","What I want is a world where neither gender nor sex are destiny. Where no child is ever told there's anything they can't do, or must do, 'because you're a boy' or 'because you're a girl.' It's not a world where anything is 'taken' from anyone - it's one where everyone's possibilities are enlarged.","You learn the most from sitting down and doing the work, regularly, patiently, sometimes in hope, sometimes despairingly.","Writing is investigation.","I've only got anywhere with Minecraft by getting my friends to explain it.","We all know that the desire for perfection can get in the way of authenticity and enjoyment; it's the same with games. There's a completist part to many of us that can't rest until we reach the perfect 100% finish point.","I wish it were true that every child had access to an education that helped them reach their full potential.","I wish that positions of power dependent on education were as open to abused children, poor children, working-class children as they are to the children of the rich and successful. I really wish that were true.","I've been a comics fan since my first hit of those gateway drawings: Judy, Asterix, and the TV cartoon 'Spider-Man and his Amazing Friend' - which naturally led me to Spider-Man comics.","The hilarity or brilliance of a forwarded link is inversely proportional to the number of people it's sent to.","Competitive sports may be where exercise becomes 'fun' for children who are good at it, but for those who are less talented, it is where exercise becomes not only physically demanding but also emotionally painful and socially humiliating.","As someone who went to school in the '70s and '80s, I can't say that I noticed much of a 'medals for all' culture myself.","The thing about having true fans, it seems, is that they remain loyal to their idea of what the work meant to them. And that might make them more exacting than the toughest studio executive or publishing boss.","I am someone who really would like to see more women in government, but Palin makes me cringe every time I hear about her.","I love books. I want to read them, and I want to own them so they're always available to be reread.","Sometimes you feel like the people who invest in hate are winning. Then you just want to talk about love and what it really means to love yourself.","No one should ever feel obliged to speak or to put themselves out publicly online, but I do think it's a good thing to do. The more of us who are women, making our work and just going 'Here I am, here's my work,' the easier it gets for everybody. It's a good thing to do.","I have no wish to offend, but I do think that holy cows need challenging.","I like things that take you by the hand and say, 'You think you know about this - you think you understand it - but there's so much that you don't.'","The women's movement gave me a set of tools to think about things like my body and how people react to me and the way that my dating life was going. It's a very practical movement - yes, it's about issues like how we can get more women MPs elected, but it's also about how feminism affects things like your relationship.","Feminists are asking the practical questions about how you want to live your life.","My childhood was full of shocks and alarums, and I had to work a long time to make a life that pleases me.","Too many keep-fit ideas are designed for those who are already fit, and they're just no fun.","If you hold strong convictions against gay marriage, you shouldn't apply for a job as a registrar.","Games don't cause racism. But the real-time chat makes nasty comments hard to moderate and easy to spread.","If something is a problem, it's all right to admit it.","The arts are valuable because they increase our sense of what it means to be human, not because of any specific skill or ability they confer."],"Naomi Benaron":["Love truly does have the power to transcend evil. It can get us through the most unspeakable of events and give us the strength to keep on putting one foot in front of the other.","I fell in love with Rwanda the moment I saw those verdant, rolling hills rise up beneath the wings of the plane as we descended toward Kigali airport.","I'm a triathlete. Running is when I do my best living and my best thinking. I love the discipline, pushing yourself to suffer as much as you can, because it leads to a form of redemption.","I was brought up in the shadow of the Holocaust. My mother lost most of her family, and I didn't realize how much the guilt of survivorship weighed on her until I was an adult.","When readers close the covers on 'Running the Rift,' I want them to understand that it is not a genocide novel but rather a story of hope and rebirth."],"Naomi Campbell":["Anger is a manifestation of a deeper issue... and that, for me, is based on insecurity, self-esteem and loneliness.","I never diet. I smoke. I drink now and then. I never work out.","I don't always wear underwear. When I'm in the heat, especially, I can't wear it. Like, if I'm wearing a flower dress, why do I have to wear underwear?","My features are completely ethnic.","It's a new challenge to see how people can change your look. I like words like transformation, reinvention, and chameleon. Because one word I don't like is predictable.","I'm always trying to do the impossible to please people. It comes from not being secure in myself and not looking at the things within I have to fix. Sometimes you keep going because you don't want to face the truth.","I live my life day by day, and that's how I continue to live it.","Am I bossy? Absolutely. I don't like to lose, and if I'm told 'no,' then I find another way to get my 'yes.' But I'm a loyal person.","Look, you have to make mistakes. That's how you learn and that's how the world works.","I've been offered jobs by companies that supported apartheid many times in the 25 years of my modeling career, but I have never taken one of them. I have to refuse that money, because I'm not going to work against my people. They've suffered enough.","Children are our future we must take care of them with maximum effort.","I don't think I was born beautiful. I just think I was born me.","I'm very observant and very instinctive. In life, you have to have the vulnerability to accept when you are to blame. And I do have that, and I am open enough to say it.","I make a lot of money and I'm worth every cent.","I work very hard and I'm worth every cent.","What makes a person is the ability to look at themselves and deal with their own lives.","I don't worry about a number. I'm fine with aging.","When I started out modeling, there weren't casting directors and there weren't stylists, so you just dealt directly with the designer. We were all much closer back then.","What I like about gyrotonics is you feel like you really elongated yourself for the day... As we all get older, everything changes and moves, and there's natural ways to exercise. I think it's important, and I think it's something that can help keep things in place.","I like to control everything, and you cannot control everything. You have to at some point say, 'I let go and I'm going to let the cards fall where they fall... For a control freak, it's hard.","I love England, especially the food. There's nothing I like more than a lovely bowl of pasta.","Everyone has a temper. A temper is an emotion.","I started this charity, Fashion for Relief, in 2005, after Hurricane Katrina happened. New Orleans was actually the first place I visited in the United States. It was one of my first big jobs, a shoot for British 'Elle.' It was April 14, 1986.","There is only going to be one Kate Moss. Kate is an icon.","I loved watching so many of the great designers I've worked with do what they do. That's why I'm still loyal to the designers that I've known since I was 16.","I would ask my mother to show me how to walk - and she did show me. That's why I think it's funny when people say, 'Did so-and-so teach you how to walk?' And I always say, 'You must be talking about my mother, because it was my mother who taught me how to walk.'","When I first got Yves Saint Laurent Couture, I didn't know how to take off a cape. I would ask Katoucha and Dalma - the real divas of the runway - 'Can you show me?' I've never been afraid to ask for help.","Feeling passionate about something doesn't mean you have to be angry.","I don't work out as much as I should, but I do believe that it's a healthy mind as well as a healthy body that keeps me fit, sound and calm.","The chocolate and crisps come in at times. You have to allow the little things that make you happy. I'm not extreme about what I eat.","I love mentoring young girls. I've always been like that.","Patrick Demarchelier was the one who got me my first 'Vogue' cover. It was French 'Vogue' - I think in '87 or '88. I think I was the first black model to be on the cover of French Vogue, which was shocking to me because when I asked them about it, they were like, 'Oh, no. We've never had that before.'","The worst was when my skirt fell down to my ankles, but I had on thick tights underneath.","After Versace was murdered, the first person to call me was Mandela.","I cannot drink or do anything that changes the mind.","I have no regrets. I've got my health.","I make a lot of money, but I don't want to talk about that.","I'm not set on a pedestal where I think I'm too high and mighty.","I've been doing my job well for 17 years. People must see something in me. Otherwise, I'd be over and out.","In fact, I don't read newspapers any longer.","Yes, I did and a lot of my friends who are in the same program as I were very much supportive, and the most important thing they said to me is do not let this interfere with what you have to do in taking car of yourself. That was the most important thing.","I was born in London and raised in Rome until I was 4. Then we went back to London, where I went to school.","Well, in brief, I was discovered by a lady called Beth Boldt. She had also been a model. She used to take pictures of the girls she found, and she took a picture of me one day in my school uniform, and it all kind of started from there.","Well, when I started modeling in the mid-'80s, the girls who did shows did shows, and the girls who did magazines did magazines. That's what was understood.","I've always been very shy of doing television. I've always said 'no.' Not to be disrespectful to anyone - I didn't want to say 'yes' and then let people down.","I feel very responsible for young models of colour. They come to me and tell me they're not getting jobs, and I do what I can to speak up for them.","I'm not angry. And I don't like the thing of the 'angry black woman,' either.","I don't like workouts that make you bulky.","I like the men to wear the pants. I don't want to wear the pants. I like men who know what they want, know what they're doing, make their own decisions... As much as I like to be the controller, it's not in my best interest."],"Naomi Judd":["Solitude is creativity's best friend, and solitude is refreshment for our souls.","There are many paths but only one journey.","Your body hears everything your mind says.","You shouldn't be ashamed of your pain. You have the right to have your pain treated.","For many people, managing pain involves using prescription medicine in combination with complementary techniques like physical therapy, acupuncture, yoga and massage. I appreciate this because I truly believe medical care should address the person as a whole - their mind, body, and spirit.","A dead end street is a good place to turn around.","I don't think we spend enough time in reflection and introspection. We don't know who we are as individuals in this culture anymore.","I've had women tell me that when their daughters see them taking care of themselves, and being defined from within, and thinking for themselves instead of thinking about that silly culture out there, it's powerful modeling.","It will kill four times as many Americans as AIDS will over the next decade. I feel that what ever kind of disability God has given me, as an entertainer and as a public figure, it is so I can be a representative for others.","They're trying to tell us that we're not right, so we have to buy their products. The number one cause of mental illness is not knowing who you are and you can't know who you are if you don't spend time honoring yourself, and living in the present.","When you're a caregiver, you need to realize that you've got to take care of yourself, because, not only are you going to have to rise to the occasion and help someone else, but you have to model for the next generation.","Change is the one thing we can be sure of.","We're spirited and spiritual... and fun follows us around.","I'm not just a big-haired redhead country singer who dresses flamboyantly, has this wicked sense of humor and wears rhinestones.","I learned more about myself by being an RN than anything else I've ever done.","It's so important for those living with chronic pain to establish good communication with both their healthcare professionals and caregivers. Clear communication about pain is vital to receiving proper diagnosis and effective treatment.","I've never experienced chronic pain myself, but I have known many people over the years who have.","I'm a communicator.","I'm a registered, vetted gun owner, but that's because I live way out in the country, like way out in the middle of nowhere.","Ignorance is my least favorite thing. I really think it's at the core of all our problems.","I grew up in a family of secrets; there was a lot of pathology in the family.","I'm a darned good listener.","I don't take vacations.","I love the ocean, but I'm just not one to lie on the beach."],"Naomi Klein":["After the Pearl Harbor attacks, around 120,000 Japanese Americans were jailed in internment camps. If an attack on U.S. soil were perpetrated by people who were not white and Christian, we can be pretty damn sure that racists would have a field day.","We can't leave everything to the free market. In fact, climate change is, I would argue, the greatest single free-market failure. This is what happens when you don't regulate corporations and you allow them to treat the atmosphere as an open sewer.","One shouldn't gamble with what is irreplaceable and precious.","That is the core of Trump. He is undoubtedly an idiot, but do not underestimate how good he is at that.","That's the trick of free market economic theory: it doesn't just ask you to only be selfish and not care about others. It tells you that by being selfish, you are helping others. And, in fact, by trying to directly help others, you will hurt them.","Throughout U.S. history, national crises have been used to suspend constitutional protections and attack basic rights. After the Civil War, with the nation in crisis, the promise of 40 acres and a mule to freed slaves was promptly betrayed.","My worry about this exclusive focus on Trump - the personality and how all of this is so unprecedented - is that then the solution seems to be, 'Well, we'll just get rid of Trump.'","I am about safety for the people and the planet.","When Nike says, just do it, that's a message of empowerment. Why aren't the rest of us speaking to young people in a voice of inspiration?","In a marketplace where it's so easy to produce products, where your competitors can essentially match you on the product itself, you need to have something else. You need to have an added value, and that added value is the identity, the idea behind your brand.","We live in an interconnected world, in an interconnected time, and we need holistic solutions. We have a crisis of inequality, and we need climate solutions that solve that crisis.","Politics hates a vacuum. If it isn't filled with hope, someone will fill it with fear.","As I was writing 'The Shock Doctrine', I was covering the Iraq War and profiteering from the war, and I started to see these patterns repeat in the aftermath of natural disasters, like the Asian tsunami and then Hurricane Katrina.","I think there has been this really bad habit of environmentalists being insufferably smug, where they are sort of saying, 'This is the issue that beats all other issues,' or, 'Your issue doesn't matter because nothing matters if the earth is fried.'","That's the big mistake the environmental movement made - 'We'll scare the hell out of you, and you'll become an activist'.","The truly powerful feed ideology to the masses like fast food while they dine on the most rarified delicacy of all: impunity.","I think I'm a critic of corporate power, whether locally or globally. And the term 'globalization' I've never found all that helpful.","A new bubble will replace the old one. A new technology will come along to fix the messes we made with the last one. In a way, that is the story of the settling of the Americas, the supposedly inexhaustible frontier to which Europeans escaped.","It's really, really hard to get in rooms with people you don't usually work with and try to find common ground.","2007, according to a Harris poll, 71 percent of Americans believed that climate change was real, that it was human caused.","We are looking to brands for poetry and for spirituality, because we're not getting those things from our communities or from each other.","What I hope is less about what the greens will do but what people who don't consider themselves part of the green movement will do.","If you're biking more and walking more, you're going to be happier and healthier. And you'll probably feel better if you take out less garbage, as most of us feel pretty crappy about that. But I don't think we can mistake those acts for doing what it takes to address a crisis at a global level.","Maybe Trump himself will be voted out through impeachment, right?","'Shocking' is like a bolt from the blue. It is something external that ruptures your world.","Change or be changed, right? And what we mean by that is that climate change, if we don't change course, if we don't change our political and economic system, is going to change everything about our physical world.","Here in Canada, the people who oppose the tar sands most forcefully are Indigenous people living downstream from the tar sands. They are not opposing it because of climate change - they are opposing it because it poisons their bodies.","What we know is that the environmental movement had a series of dazzling victories in the late '60s and in the '70s where the whole legal framework for responding to pollution and to protecting wildlife came into law. It was just victory after victory after victory. And these were what came to be called 'command-and-control' pieces of legislation.","Even though I believe in mass social movements, I'm uncomfortable in crowds.","This phrase, 'culture jamming,' was very much in vogue in the 1990s when these superbrands sort of emerged and started kind of projecting their names onto ever more surfaces.","Fossil fuels are - they're inherently centralized. And you need a lot of infrastructure to get them out, and you need a lot of infrastructure to transport it, as Obama was explaining in front of all that pipe, right? Whereas renewable energy is everywhere.","The more hardcore conservative you are, the more tightly identified you are with defending the interest of capital as an interest of the system based on hyper-competition, the more likely it is that you vehemently deny climate change. Because if climate change is real, your worldview will come crashing down around you.","I think the fossil fuel industry is genuinely freaked out by the combination of the price collapse, the divestment movement, and that fact that renewable energy is getting so cheap so fast.","The divestment movement is a start at challenging the excesses of capitalism. It's working to delegitimize fossil fuels and showing that they're just as unethical as profits from the tobacco industry.","Those looking for ideology in the White House should consider this: For the men who rule our world, rules are for other people.","Africa is poor because its investors and its creditors are unspeakably rich.","I am not saying Russia is not important, but Trump's base is very well defended against that: 'the liberal media is out to get him', 'it's fake news', and all the rest.","If David Duke got the percentage of the vote that Le Pen got, we would be terrified, as well we should be.","Among my generation, there was a purist position that any contact with electoral politics was an unforgiveable compromise.","There have been presidents with business interests before. But there has never been a fully commercialized global brand as a sitting U.S. president. That is unprecedented.","The Trump Organization is paid millions of dollars by these developers for the privilege of putting the Trump name on those towers.","I had maybe watched 'The Apprentice' a couple of times. I didn't know that in later seasons they deported half of their contestants into tents in the backyard. They called it Trump's trailer park.","I want to act, if I can, as a bridge for people who read 'Shock Doctrine' or 'No Logo'. People who are sitting out for whatever reasons.","The way in which people talk about climate is just so wonky and so abstract and such a boys' club that it makes a lot of women just roll their eyes or feel that they are somehow not qualified. I certainly had to fight that feeling in myself in order to write about it.","I really did have this powerful sense, when I was in New Orleans after the storm, of watching all these profiteers descend on Baton Rouge to lobby to get rid of the housing projects and privatise the school system - I thought I was in some science-fiction experiment.","We live in a society that is powered by fossil fuels, but for the meantime, we're in it. Maybe there's, like, five people living in the woods off-grid, but they're spending all their time maintaining that, and they don't have much time left over for anything else.","I think I would say that there is absolutely no way to reconcile an austerity agenda with climate action. Our political class needs to understand that the fight against austerity and the fight for climate action are the same fight.","I think there's a couple of things going on. One is that Trump's relationship with his base is not the traditional relationship of a politician and the people who elected him, and the constituency, which is a relationship of some accountability, right? The idea is that the politicians are working for the people. They're public servants.","This is what he has been selling on the 'The Apprentice', through his self-help books, how to - you know, 'Trump 101' or the 'Art of the Deal' or, really, back to 'Art of the Deal'. So almost the more he gets away with, the more he is reinforcing his brand.","Because the Republicans are never going to turn on Trump so long as he still has his base, and he will continue to have his base so long as this idea that he is standing up for workers, it remains intact. And the only way that that gets eroded is if it isn't just about Russia all the time, but is also about those economic betrayals.","That is the meaning of the Trump brand - being the boss who is so rich and so powerful he can do whatever he wants. So the way in which he ran for president was to embody that idea as fully as he possibly could with his outrageousness.","I do believe that our ability to jam the Trump brand is somewhat limited. I think we can chip away at it, but ultimately, the way to undermine the Trump brand is a better product in the political marketplace, if you'll forgive the capitalist metaphor.","The reason why nothing sticks to Trump - or very little sticks to Trump - is that he created this brand idea that has to do with being the guy who gets away from it.","The electoral strategy for 2016 was, 'Vote for me; I'm not Trump,' and, 'Trump is dangerous, so get out and vote.'","For someone with a background of economic justice, what scared me about climate change is not just that the sea level will rise and we'll have more storms - it's how this intersects with that cocktail of inequality and racism.","There is a triple layer of jargon when writing about climate change. You have the scientists, who are very cautious now because of the amount of climate denial. Then you have the U.N. jargon - I had to carry around a glossary of terms. It was like an alphabet soup.","I've never seen a movement spread as fast as the fossil fuel divestment movement.","The problem with Donald Trump is that he went and designed a brand that is entirely amoral.","I don't think there could've been a pitch as crass as Trump's 'I can fix America because I'm rich' without that groundwork laid by Davos and the Clinton Global Initiative.","Look at the structure of the Gates Foundation and this idea that, rather than trying to solve these huge global problems through institutions with some kind of democracy and transparency baked into them, we're just going to outsource it to benevolent billionaires.","I was having a lot of people ask me to update 'The Shock Doctrine' and add a chapter about Trump.","I don't think you can understand Trump's relationship to his voters and how he gets away with what he gets away with, without understanding the pact between a lifestyle brand and its consumer base and how that really transformed the global economy in the 1990s.","I can tell you Donald Trump's products may not be made in America, but Donald Trump was made in America.","The Trump family's business model is part of a broader shift in corporate structure that has taken place within many brand-based multinationals, one with transformative impacts on culture and the job market, trends that I wrote about in my first book, 'No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies'.","As I explored Trump's inextricable relationship with his commercial brand, and its implications for the future of politics, I began to see why so many of the attacks on him have failed to stick - and how we can identify ways of resisting him that will be more effective.","A large-scale crisis - whether a terrorist attack or a financial crash - would likely provide the pretext to declare some sort of state of exception or emergency, where the usual rules no longer apply.","A state of shock is what results when a gap opens up between events and our initial ability to explain them. When we find ourselves in that position, without a story, without our moorings, a great many people become vulnerable to authority figures telling us to fear one another and relinquish our rights for the greater good.","Brands like Starbucks came along and talked about their brand as itself being a community, the idea that Starbucks is what they like to call a 'third place,' which is not their idea; it's the idea of basic citizenry needing a place that is not work, that is not home, where citizens gather.","The customer is always right: 'It's my money. You have to listen to me'.","Nike was the essence of sports, transcendence through sports.","Since the 1980s, we've been living in this era, really, of corporate rule, based on this idea that the role of government is to liberate the power of capital so that they can have as much economic growth as quickly as possible, and then all good things will flow from that.","If you look at the polling around climate change in this country before 'Sandy', that was kind of the low point in terms of Americans believing that climate change was real and that humans were causing it.","We have a structural problem because you can simultaneously understand the medium to long-term risks of climate change and also come to the conclusion that it is in your short-term economic interest to invest in oil and gas. Which is why, you know, anybody who tells you that the market is going to fix this on its own is lying to you.","We need to invest in healthcare, in education, in the sciences. And in so doing, we will tackle one of the most intractable problems we face, which is gross wealth inequality. We can't fight climate change without dealing with inequality in our countries and between our countries.","Governments started negotiating towards emission reduction in 1990. That's when the official negotiations started.","The Heartland Institute, which people mostly only know in terms of the fact that it hosts these annual conferences of climate change skeptics or deniers, it's important to know that the Heartland Institute is first and foremost a free market think tank. It's not a scientific organization.","In the midst of the pain and panic of the Great Depression, as many as 2 million people of Mexican descent were expelled from the United States.","While everyone is focused on security and civil liberties, Trump's Cabinet of billionaires will try to quietly push through even more extreme measures to enrich themselves and their class, like dismantling Social Security or auctioning off major pieces of government for profit.","One of the ideas that I wanted to highlight, which is actually a very bipartisan idea - it's not just about conservatives - is this worship of wealth, the CEO saviour.","Trump would have been unelectable were it not for the groundwork laid by Bill Clinton and Bill Gates, two liberal heroes.","As soon as it was clear, in Copenhagen in 2009, that the Senate was blocking Obama from introducing meaningful climate legislation, the push was for him to use executive authority, use the EPA, use the tool of federal leases, and there was just a refusal to do it.","We have to change the kind of free trade deals we sign. We would have to change the absolutely central role of frenetic consumption in our culture. We would have to change the role of money in politics and our political system.","In terms of Hurricane Sandy, I really do see some hopeful grassroots responses, particularly in the Rockaways, where people were very organized right from the beginning, where Occupy Sandy was very strong, where new networks emerged.","The growth in emissions is coming from the developing world. So if we are going to get out of this, it's going to come out of a process of cooperation and collaboration. That's why it really requires a paradigm shift.","There is some pretty powerful self-interest in wanting a future that is not just running storm-to-storm. The argument that I make is not that we aren't competitive and selfish and greedy. We are. We're all of these things. We're complicated, competitive, greedy and nasty, and kind and generous and compassionate.","When I feel my blood sugar getting off, I drink a glass of kale juice. It's so disgusting you don't want to eat anything!","I was the rebel in our family and a child of the eighties. That meant going to the mall.","Before I had Toma, I was one of those people who had no interest in other people's kids. I was. 'Don't hand me that baby!'","It takes me a long time writing books. It takes me about five years to write a book, and when I'm done, the last thing I want to do is to do it again.","What you want to do is you want to own as little sort of hard infrastructure as possible, and your real value is your name and how you build that up.","He was about building up the Trump name and then selling it and leasing it in as many different ways as possible.","You've got the Trump water and Trump Steaks and Trump's very so-called dodgy university. And so many of the towers, the Trump towers around the world, the Trump resorts around the world, those are not owned by the Trump Organization.","My sister lives in Oklahoma. And, you know, it is so shocking that James Inhofe, the foremost climate-denying senator, is from the state that is so deeply climate-affected.","There are things that government can do to incentivize the free market to do a better job, yes. But is that a replacement for getting in the way, actively, of the fossil fuel industry and preventing them from destroying our chances of a future on a livable planet? It's not a replacement.","I've been trying to pinpoint what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico, because I'm Canadian, and I can draw no ancestral ties.","If there is one thing BP's 'watery improv act' made clear, it is that, as a culture, we have become far too willing to gamble with things that are precious and irreplaceable, and to do so without a back-up plan, without an exit strategy.","Everybody that's trying to get anything progressive done in this country knows that the biggest barrier is getting money out of politics.","I think people are just incredibly depressed and hopeless about the prospects for change.","When you start talking about sacrifices, pretty soon people start feeling like chumps.","As soon as you write about climate change, the first attempt to discredit you is, 'Well, you wrote this on a computer,' or, 'You took a plane to this conference.' So your opinion isn't valid.","When I went to Australia, I had this feeling, like, 'Wow, this is really a different country.' I think that feeling of genuine foreignness, that this is a very different culture, which is increasingly rare in our globalised world.","My father was born in Newark, New Jersey, and my mother was born in Philadelphia. They both went to Stanford for grad school and met there.","My grandfather was actually a union organizer at Walt Disney. He was an animator. He used to draw Donald Duck for Walt Disney."],"Naomi Scott":["I'd always put on little shows at home, but when I was 11, I did a community event in Woodford, where anyone could go. You had three days of vocal training and performed your song at the end. I sang 'I Say a Little Prayer.' It's a tough song to sing but they gave me the confidence to go for it and belt it out.","I'm aware of the decisions I make and the responsibility I have as a role model. I wouldn't disregard that. It's a privilege. That's not to say people don't make mistakes - we're all human. No one's perfect. I'm just going to be myself.","There are too many people around keeping me grounded to go off the rails. I'm my own person.","I'd always put on little shows at home, but when I was 11, I did a community event in Woodford, where anyone could go. You had three days of vocal training and performed your song at the end.","I'm aware of the decisions I make and the responsibility I have as a role model. I wouldn't disregard that.","I want to pursue music in the future, but I'm taking it a step at a time and making sure I'm constantly growing.","I'm really close to my family, and we talk through things. My parents are so amazing, they're brilliant. We try to take one step at a time and be wise about the decisions we make and keep our values and the things that are important.","Within a few weeks of coming back from filming 'Lemonade Mouth,' I got these scripts, and 'Terra Nova' was the one that stuck out. I was like, 'Oh my gosh'.","No 17-year-old is just one thing, especially in this day and age. Kids are into all sorts of things.","All of us, although we may have a label attached to us, that's not who we are.","I'd always put on little shows at home, but when I was 11, I did a community event in Woodford, where anyone could go.","There are too many people around keeping me grounded to go off the rails.","I'm my own person. You can't generalise about people.","I'm aware of the decisions I make and the responsibility I have as a role model. I wouldn't disregard that. It's a privilege.","I'm really close to my family, and we talk through things.","My parents are so amazing; they're brilliant. We try to take one step at a time and be wise about the decisions we make and keep our values and the things that are important."],"Naomi Shihab Nye":["You know, those of us who leave our homes in the morning and expect to find them there when we go back - it's hard for us to understand what the experience of a refugee might be like.","As a direct line to human feeling, empathic experience, genuine language and detail, poetry is everything that headline news is not. It takes us inside situations, helps us imagine life from more than one perspective, honors imagery and metaphor - those great tools of thought - and deepens our confidence in a meaningful world.","My father was very disappointed by war and fighting. And he thought language could help us out of cycles of revenge and animosity. And so, as a journalist, he always found himself asking lots of questions and trying to gather information. He was always very clear to underscore the fact that Jewish people and Arab people were brother and sister.","I think whenever you love something or somebody it means that you have to extend yourself, you have to grow - get a little larger. You can't stay in your little comfortable - spot.","During the Gulf War, I remember two little third grade girls saying to me - after I read them some poems by writers in Iraq - 'You know, we never thought about there being children in Iraq before.' And I thought, 'Well those poems did their job, because now they'll think about everything a little bit differently.'","I think the job of writing and literature is to encourage each one of us to believe that we're living in a story.","I do think that all of us think in poems.","I grew up in St. Louis in a tiny house full of large music - Mahalia Jackson and Marian Anderson singing majestically on the stereo, my German-American mother fingering 'The Lost Chord' on the piano as golden light sank through trees, my Palestinian father trilling in Arabic in the shower each dawn.","I keep thinking, we teach children to use language to solve their disputes. We teach them not to hit and fight and bite. Then look what adults do!"],"Naomi Watts":["I always love being in the company of women. It's all about good conversation and great wine.","I'm not this dark, twisted person. Yes, I have my demons and this is my way of exorcising them. It gets them out - and better out than in.","As you get older, you overthink and can talk yourself out of anything. It's good to be a bit reckless and experimental.","Parisian women have an inner elegance that's envied the world over. They are so relaxed about ageing and seem to acquire more charisma and beauty with time. Who wouldn't want to be like them? That's the trick - to embrace the natural progression of life and to be confident.","When I had dark hair I definitely felt that I was more anonymous.","There's a lot of skeletons in my closet, but I know what they're wearing. I'm not gonna act all ashamed of it.","I had gotten to a place where I truly believed everything I was called: 'not sexy,' 'not funny,' 'too intense,' desperate.' All those labels they gave me, I took them because there wasn't a trace of my true self left.","I think it's good to explore it. I don't feel bad about that... I mean, I think everyone has a sense of - has a dark side, has a - carries some sort of pain with them. And I find it fun to crack it open and go there.","You have to make peace with yourself. The key is to find the harmony in what you have.","Maybe in the workplace I have more courage than other areas in my life.","Whatever is said about roles drying up, I intend to keep working. Certainly now the roles couldn't be more interesting - playing mothers, divorcees. I think it's going to be exciting to play a mother of teenagers. The longer your life, the deeper it gets.","Pain is such an important thing in life. I think that as an artist you have to experience suffering.","There was a time I was very much blaming the way I felt on L.A, that it was a vacuum of creativity, of humor or anything organic, and I was really angry at the place. But then today I feel completely different - I love L.A.!","I find myself gravitating towards drama. It interests me. In the books I read, the paintings I like, it's always the darker stuff.","I'm a tomboy now. I always wanted to fit in with my brother's group, so I climbed trees and played with lead soldiers. But I'm a woman's woman. I never understood women who don't have woman friends.","If I have to produce movies, direct movies, whatever to change the way Hollywood treats older women, I'll do it. If I have to bend the rules, I will. If I have to break them, I will.","It was total naivety that got me to Hollywood. I thought it was going to happen straight away. I told myself 'give it 5 years, there's no way I'll be here after that if it doesn't happen'. Cut to ten years later!","It's always nerve-racking to take off your clothes on film. But doing it with a woman felt safer than with a man. You know you can say, 'Don't grab me there: That's where my cellulite is'!","Mum put me in drama classes when I was about 14. I'd been going on about it for some time, so maybe it was a way to shut me up.","Oh, I'm definitely a wild child.","On set is where I feel comfortable. The red carpet stuff, talking about the film, explaining your own life, it doesn't come naturally. It's all necessary stuff I suppose but it's not my strength.","That's one of the lucky things about getting the success later on. I know how I want to dress, I know what kind of house I want to live in, I just know more about myself, and that's true about the roles I want to play and what parts of myself I want to express. You're just more in touch with yourself.","The biggest place I look for validation is from my mother. That's the little girl in me that will never grow up.","There's a set of rules out there somewhere that says it all ends by 40. I hope to be able to defy that because I truly love my work.","We're so afraid of death in our culture, but I think if we understand it better, then we'll appreciate the life we have more.","You won't find me in a romantic comedy. Those movies don't speak to me. People don't come to talk to me about those scripts, because they probably think I'm this dark, twisted, miserable person.","I know it's silly, but I still think I'm 28.","I'm not sure why I still think of myself as 28 - maybe that's the point where you start growing up, and then you just feel the same for evermore.","As much as my kids keep me young, they also have the reverse effect when I don't have the energy.","I wish I'd started having kids sooner so I could have had a few more.","Whenever I am in Paris, all I want to do is inhale a big plate of cheese. And in New York, my favourite thing is a toasted bagel with cream cheese. Not only do I not avoid carbs, I more or less have them in every meal. When I start denying myself foods, that's when I crave them.","I hate diets. Restriction makes me feel rebellious. I find that I look my best when I feel my best, whatever that takes. For me, above all else, it means being around the people I want to be with.","There are no tricks to balancing work and family. It is a struggle all the time, and you just do your best. I think men are much better at compartmentalising.","Whenever a film allows you to think and feel and take it beyond the moment, I think it's achieved something. And 'Funny Games' does that.","The use of violence in movies is a subject that's worth addressing. I'm not standing on a soapbox or wagging a finger, but I'm interested in those subjects for sure.","Some movies are the kind you take home with you at the end of the day, and some, you can let go.","Directors are our teachers, and I'm always craving to work with a great director. They're pretty much the first thing that interests me about a project. Let's put it this way: It'll take me a lot longer to read a script if there's no director attached.","Now that I have kids, I don't want to do so many daredevily things anymore.","I actually have a fear of the water because I nearly drowned. I got caught in a rip tide, and I wasn't a good swimmer because that was when I was emigrating from England to Australia.","Women in their 40s have gone through quite a few different things, and so the roles are going to reflect that. People say, 'Oh, it's done by 40,' and now everyone knows it's not. I actually feel like the roles are a lot more interesting.","When I was about 14, my family emigrated from England to Australia, and we decided to stop in Bali on the way through.","There must be a thread in everything I choose to take on, and I can't say it's a calculated thread, but I think you end up doing the work that's resonating with you.","Personally I feel, for me, it's tough to do Botox - but it's also tough not to! Sometimes, I think I need the help. Whatever anyone else chooses is fine with me - no judgment.","Of course, I want to look the best I can, but I am playing characters that should match my age, and the women and the material that I am interested in are usually going through something. I have to be able to live in my face and tell the story of the character I've taken on.","There's so much focus on celebrity these days; we're in the Kardashian era, and it's slightly scary.","I can't see the film industry coming to a grinding halt any time soon. I think we may be more open to negotiations and things like that, but I think the art world tends to thrive in times of recession."],"Naomi Weisstein":["Psychologists have set about describing the true nature of women with a certainty and a sense of their own infallibility rarely found in the secular world.","In some extremely important ways, people are what you expect them to be, or at least they behave as you expect them to behave."],"Naomi Wolf":["Obstacles, of course, are developmentally necessary: they teach kids strategy, patience, critical thinking, resilience and resourcefulness.","What, after all, is the narrative of 'the American Dream?' It was a discourse formulated between the 1880s and the 1920s in the United States during the great waves of migration and expansion and reforms of the Progressive Era.","In a fascist system, it's not the lies that count but the muddying. When citizens can't tell real news from fake, they give up their demands for accountability bit by bit.","Most urgently, women's identity must be premised upon our 'beauty' so that we will remain vulnerable to outside approval, carrying the vital sensitive organ of self-esteem exposed to the air.","The idea that women are innately gentle is a fantasy, and a historically recent one. Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction, is depicted as wreathed in male human skulls; the cruel entertainments of the Romans drew audiences as female as they were male; Boudicca led her British troops bloodily into battle.","In the U.S., the '50s and '60s marked the documentary's golden age, especially at CBS, where pioneering television journalist Edward R. Murrow, immortalised in George Clooney's 'Good Night, and Good Luck,' produced such landmark investigations as the CBS Reports programme 'Hunger in America.'","The press doesn't stop publishing, by the way, in a fascist escalation; it simply watches what it says. That too can be an incremental process, and the pace at which the free press polices itself depends on how journalists are targeted.","As a free-speech advocate, I believe that adults should have access to any material they want. As a parent, and a community member, I think people should be able to protect their homes from imagery - much of it violent - that is, I feel, a form of child abuse when adult society inflicts it upon children.","If you look at weak democracies, the oligarchies that have taken undue control of them always seek to tamper with the vote. It is important for oligarchs to have elections to give their guy a veneer of legitimacy - and important for the vote always to turn out 'their way.'","After we were hit on September 11, 2001, we were in a state of national shock. Less than six weeks later, on October 26 2001, the U.S.A. Patriot Act was passed by a Congress that had little chance to debate it; many said that they scarcely had time to read it.","The First Amendment was designed to allow for disruption of business as usual. It is not a quiet and subdued amendment or right.","I'm a big believer in debate and difference of opinion.","Victorian feminists made the mistake of making membership of the sisterhood conditional on signing up to a particular policy agenda. Marxist feminists made a similar mistake of saying, 'You can't be a real feminist unless you join with miners, the unions, the vegans.'","'Beauty' is a currency system like the gold standard. Like any economy, it is determined by politics, and in the modern age in the West is is the last, best belief system that keeps male dominance intact.","Western women have been controlled by ideals and stereotypes as much as by material constraints.","It is fairly well-known what has been behind that climate change denial in America: vast sums pumped into an ignorance industry by the oil and gas lobbies.","Kim Kardashian's marriage to Kris Humphries famously lasted 72 days, and was reported in the tabloids as being all about the big bucks paid by magazines for the bridal photos: it is a spectacle of a bride-to-be as entrepreneur, not as romantic heroine; the groom, in this scenario, is nothing but a prop.","French existentialism is an unhelpful philosophy in which to couch modern feminism: born from the ravages of the Second World War, it is a cynical, individualistic school of thought that posits the self and personal choice as the measure of life's entire meaning.","Since Madonna is positioned as always 'cooler than thou,' we all are primed for schadenfreude if something in her fabulous life goes amiss.","It is standard practice for corrupt leaders who are seeking a certain political outcome to hype or manipulate a terror threat or a threat of violent domestic subversion. While sometimes the threat is manufactured, frequently the hyped threat is based on a real danger.","Italy in the 1920s, Germany in the '30s, East Germany in the '50s, Czechoslovakia in the '60s, the Latin American dictatorships in the '70s, China in the '80s and '90s - all dictatorships and would-be dictators target newspapers and journalists.","Peaceful, lawful protest - if it is effective - is innately disruptive of 'business as usual.' That is why it is effective.","For Gore 2000, I was a formal campaign adviser: contrary to RNC mythology, my brief was not 'wardrobe,' but rather policy on women's issues, and messaging. I was also married to a Clinton speechwriter, and observed the message decision-making process from the perspective of a spouse.","Women have face-lifts in a society in which women without them appear to vanish from sight.","To ask women to become unnaturally thin is to ask them to relinquish their sexuality.","Pain is real when you get other people to believe in it. If no one believes in it but you, your pain is madness or hysteria.","No matter what a woman's appearance may be, it will be used to undermine what she is saying and taken to individualize - as her personal problem - observations she makes about the beauty myth in society.","The symbolic value of having an African-American president has certainly eased some racial tensions in America, but they're not gone.","How is it even sustainable in 21st-century America that women earn, on average, 77 cents for every dollar earned by men?","It is important to distinguish between the power of the Internet to make the great change it can, and the limits and vulnerabilities of that change without real-time political mobilization deployed globally to protect those who venture out, especially in closed societies, into the heady new vistas it offers.","A utopian future for the Internet could be secured if the heavy-duty influencers - and the grassroots influencers tweeting along - can create a new global organization peopled with defenders of Internet freedom.","From 1970 onwards, our culture told both sexes that individual expression was paramount. And for women, that was defined as the right to choose an interesting a career, a high-status mate, the desirable handbag or vacation, the perfect family size, and a definitionally fruitless quest for 'perfection.'","Madonna is that forbidden thing, the Nietzschean creative woman. Her preoccupation with a high level of work doesn't allow her to follow the usual script that powerful women are expected to follow - 'don't hate me for my success, don't hate me for my power.'","Protesters should make their own media and not rely on mainstream media to cover them.","In 70s America, protest used to be very effective, but in subsequent decades municipalities have sneakily created a web of 'overpermiticisation' - requirements that were designed to stifle freedom of assembly and the right to petition government for redress of grievances, both of which are part of our first amendment.","Since Reagan there has been this tradition, which has become a cliche, of promising morning in America, this fake optimism, we're the best, the city on the hill. In fact the great American task is self-scrutiny.","'The End of America' details the 10 steps that would-be dictators always take in seeking to close an open society; it argued that the Bush administration had been advancing each one.","For all the power of video and film, I am not giving up my pen. I am just much more likely to try to link essays to webcasts or videos. The best way for these two media to move forward, to inform and make change, is in tandem; together they are more than the sum of their parts.","Documentary film without nuanced journalistic sourcing risks being sensational, tendentious or broad-brushed.","It is never smart, even in a strong democracy, to declare some debate off limits. In a weakening democracy it is catastrophic.","Let's dare to release our immature fantasies of a magically faultless U.S. system and a magically protected election process. We have been lucky as a nation, but sometimes continued luck depends on action.","Citizens who live or work near protest sites or marches have every right to be free of violence from protesters, and they should never be subjected to destruction of property.","The First Amendment applies to rogues and scoundrels. You don't lose your First Amendment rights because of a sleazy personality, or even for having committed a crime. Felons in jail are protected by the First Amendment.","We are all Julian Assange. Serious reporters discuss classified information every day - go to any Washington or New York dinner party where real journalists are present, and you will hear discussion of leaked or classified information. That is journalists' job in a free society.","The Tea Party emerged from a laudably grassroots base: libertarians, fervent Constitutionalists, and ordinary people alarmed at the suppression of liberties, whether by George W. Bush or Barack Obama.","My job is to notice echoes and notice resonances. Scientists are not supposed to do the same thing that cultural critics do.","When I was a baby feminist, leading feminist thinkers were insisting that if women ran the world, there would be no sadism or war.","We often feel a twinge of guilt over our own fascination with presidential candidates' wives - as if we are secretly reading the 'Star' for our campaign information instead of the policy journals.","Every Yom Kippur, Jewish tradition requires a strict spiritual inventory. You aren't supposed to just sit around feeling guilty, but to take action in the real world to set things right.","I am delighted to be joining 'Guardian U.S.'s team as a weekly columnist, and to have the chance to address American and global current events on its distinguished platform. 'Guardian U.S.' brings the 'Guardian's hard-hitting investigative brand to a new focus on American news and opinion.","In a fascist shift, reporters start to face more and more harassment, and they have to be more and more courageous simply in order to do their jobs.","There was a bad patch in the '80s and early '90s when feminist thinking had become sort of a monopoly and had developed a series of litmus tests.","I don't think most men do hate women at all - I think most men are trying their best and facing a culturation into masculine behaviour that forces them to deny their own humanity and to exaggerate distance from the world of women.","Of course a woman who decides to work full time as a mother in the home can be happy and deserves full respect from us. Motherhood is one of the most challenging and creative jobs anyone can do. The goal is to remake the world so that our choices are not so stark.","What we should notice is that studies show that fathers' presence in their children's lives has a marked effect on how well their kids do later in life, so why aren't we asking how we can better liberate men from the workplace to be home with their kids more often?"],"Naomie Harris":["You don't need to follow trends to be stylish.","I cry at random things, like a flower, or someone giving me a present, or my sister giving me a nice hug.","It's true about the eyes being the window to the soul. Your face can be etched with worry, and twisted by ageing, but the eyes tell the true story of who you are.","I think there's nothing more amazing than helping people every day.","I think the role of the Bond woman has changed so much over the years that it now doesn't follow a typical archetypical view. Before, it was very much a beautiful woman who didn't contribute much and who usually ended up getting killed or was arm candy for Bond. But now the women in a Bond movie have so much more to offer.","Kids should be naughty and go through that rebellious phase I didn't have.","There are certain expectations that are put on you as a child actor, but mainly it's just turn up and say your lines with a lot of energy and a cute smile.","Your boss is only human and just wants the best from you.","At Cambridge, it was the weirdest culture. Everyone pretended they didn't do any work, yet it was so competitive.","I've never been that person who wants a Rolls Royce or wants to live in a mansion or what have you.","The Windrush era is a very important part of British history as it helps us understand how and why we became the multicultural society we are today, and also helps us understand the history of race relations in this country.","As a society we should be encouraging people out of the debt-culture mindset, not promoting it.","What I generally get from being in Africa is a sense of warmth and openness. As a stranger, you are always welcomed into people's homes and people are always offering you food. That generosity is incredibly touching.","I did not enjoy Cambridge. But I shouldn't blame Cambridge alone. I wasn't ready for university or for the wrench of leaving home. It was a big cultural shock.","I really, really love Daniel Craig as Bond.","I know a lot of actors who get a part and then they dissect it and they want to change it and they want to add stuff. I'm always amazed and so impressed by actors who do that.","I'm totally in love with Jane Austen and have always been in love with Jane Austen. I did my dissertation at university on black people in eighteenth-century Britain - so I'd love to do a Jane Austen-esque film but with black people.","My mum believes in me almost more than I believe in myself.","Actors need steely determination. It's a tough profession with plenty of knocks along the way. You have to be very determined and never take 'no' for an answer.","Everybody struggles with being an oddball. It's tough trying to fit in when you're a kid; then you become an adult and you think, 'I'm just going to be myself and either they accept it or they don't.' But you know what? I like me, and that's the most important thing.","I have many different sides; I can be the life and soul of the party - or a wallflower.","I think my roles have been wonderfully varied. Not one has been racially stereotypical, and I have purposely chosen them like that.","The wonderful thing about drama school is that it stretches you in a way the industry doesn't.","I was brought up in Britain, and I'm very proud of my Britishness and my culture.","Yes, I'm obsessed with health, which has been an interesting journey. I went down the raw-food diet route, but got ill. It was really hard, especially in Britain in winter, trying to survive on raw carrots. I became so ill and anemic, so I stopped that and became a vitamin junkie. I just ate lots of vegetables, exercised and breathed.","We eat food all the time and don't really understand what goes into something like bread.","The ethos of most films is that you make a film, you exploit the community, you exploit the environment, and it's OK because you made a great film, you know?","I live on the same street as my family, actually. I live across the road. I'm a real family person!","Hollywood 'friends' are only after one thing. They're looking out for the next big thing, and they don't want to miss out on you just in case.","For some reason, I just lack that ability to be embarrassed about going up to people. I even do it for friends if they want to ask someone out.","I don't think I have the assets to play the more traditional Bond Girl.","When you go somewhere like Kenya and you see how the children don't have pencils and pens, and all of these things are considered luxuries, and what a privilege they see education as and how hungry they are to learn, I wanted to give my brother and sister long lectures. That definitely stayed with me.","To have the kind of success I have had is really amazing, and I am incredibly grateful.","I'm incredibly impatient; I'd like to be less so, and more content with the now.","I'm not the greatest driver. I don't know if I'll ever master the art.","Getting to travel around the world and go to glamorous locations is certainly not what I had as a kid.","I always find filming stressful. I get very caught up thinking about my character - 'Am I doing it right? Should it be done this way?'","I started acting when I was seven. And I went to a local drama school which is very well-known in London. Because of that, I started getting jobs, and I worked all the time as a child, pretty much non-stop.","There weren't really any visible men in my family when I was growing up, but of course there have been men in my life, wonderful men.","I try to be upbeat. I read this book which tells you to write down everything that you're grateful for each day. Now I'm constantly noticing all the little things that make me joyful.","I was too much of an innocent when I went to university.","I still pray a lot. I still believe in God. I just don't believe in any set religion.","I like to believe that we all pray to the same god.","I love Africa.","I love Sam Mendes. He's a fantastic director.","I love make-up and the process of transforming my face for a night out, but I definitely don't believe in wearing it every day. I think it's really important to be comfortable with the way you look without it.","I would never wear anything too revealing. I'm not a fan of dresses where you look nude... I think that looks a bit desperate.","Make-up is an extension of your clothes.","When you're on set, the crew are like your family because you see them every day, six days a week.","Be open and honest, but perceptive to your boss's situation. That's my advice to graduates worried about working with a new boss.","I don't why I was bullied. I was quite shy and skinny. Very nerdy, very bookwormish. I think I was just a target.","I love doing a film with a new bunch of people."],"Naoto Kan":["The safest nuclear power or energy policy is to realize 'zero nuclear power.'","If you are unable to understand the cause of a problem it is impossible to solve it.","The trend in the world right now is - not just in developed countries, but in developing countries including China and India - there is a movement to build more and more nuclear plants.","The question arises whether private companies can bear responsibility when considering the large risks involved with nuclear business.","It is possible for Japan to become the model of a society that does not rely on nuclear power.","While many technological measures can be taken to secure safety at nuclear power plants, such measures on their own cannot cover great risks.","I will carry on the torch of reviving Japan that the Democratic Party received from the people.","I am advocating a weak yen to a certain extent.","In Japan, the average age of agricultural workers is 65.8. When the aging of its population is accelerating so rapidly, it will be very difficult to sustain the sector whether we liberalize trade or not.","So, Japan as a country has lost its vigor; it feels very much closed in for various reasons.","I believe in any country, matters that relate to its territory would, of course, provoke strong sentiments amongst the people of that country.","In fact, the Senkaku Islands are... inherent territory of Japan that is recognized in our history and also by international law.","China has become a major presence for most countries around the world but notably for its neighboring countries in Asia. So I think it is a common position for Japan and its Asian neighbors that we certainly would strive to maintain as much as possible friendly relations with China.","I wouldn't call myself anti-nuclear.","After the Second World War, people in Japan no longer died for their country, and even that expression was no longer used.","When the world has 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 nuclear plants, can we call that a safe world? I think we need to properly have this debate.","I tend to agree with many aspects of President Obama's policies.","Nuclear arms and atomic power represent a technology in which coexistence with man is extremely difficult."],"Napoleon Bonaparte":["Glory is fleeting, but obscurity is forever.","You must not fight too often with one enemy, or you will teach him all your art of war.","A leader is a dealer in hope.","Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.","Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily.","Women are nothing but machines for producing children.","Impossible is a word to be found only in the dictionary of fools.","The first virtue in a soldier is endurance of fatigue; courage is only the second virtue.","Great ambition is the passion of a great character.

The winner will be the one who controls that chaos, both his own and the enemies.","If you wish to be a success in the world, promise everything, deliver nothing.","I am sometimes a fox and sometimes a lion. The whole secret of government lies in knowing when to be the one or the other.","Religion is what keeps the poor from murdering the rich.","The best way to keep one's word is not to give it.","Music is the voice that tells us that the human race is greater than it knows.","When small men attempt great enterprises, they always end by reducing them to the level of their mediocrity.","If you want a thing done well, do it yourself.","Ability is nothing without opportunity.","History is a set of lies agreed upon.","From the heights of these pyramids, forty centuries look down on us.","Respect the burden.","In politics... never retreat, never retract... never admit a mistake.","The people to fear are not those who disagree with you, but those who disagree with you and are too cowardly to let you know.","The strong man is the one who is able to intercept at will the communication between the senses and the mind.","Men are more easily governed through their vices than through their virtues.","History is the version of past events that people have decided to agree upon.","A throne is only a bench covered with velvet.","Imagination rules the world.","Public opinion is the thermometer a monarch should constantly consult.","The army is the true nobility of our country.","It is the cause, not the death, that makes the martyr.","A true man hates no one.","A man will fight harder for his interests than for his rights.","He who knows how to flatter also knows how to slander.","One should never forbid what one lacks the power to prevent.","Among those who dislike oppression are many who like to oppress.","Men take only their needs into consideration - never their abilities.","With audacity one can undertake anything, but not do everything.","Water, air, and cleanness are the chief articles in my pharmacy.","Take time to deliberate, but when the time for action has arrived, stop thinking and go in.","I made all my generals out of mud.","Four hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets.","The battle of Austerlitz is the grandest of all I have fought.","Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet.","The surest way to remain poor is to be an honest man.","Throw off your worries when you throw off your clothes at night.","If I had to choose a religion, the sun as the universal giver of life would be my god.","There are only two forces in the world, the sword and the spirit. In the long run the sword will always be conquered by the spirit.","The great proof of madness is the disproportion of one's designs to one's means.","One must change one's tactics every ten years if one wishes to maintain one's superiority.","Power is my mistress. I have worked too hard at her conquest to allow anyone to take her away from me.","Nothing is more difficult, and therefore more precious, than to be able to decide.","In order to govern, the question is not to follow out a more or less valid theory but to build with whatever materials are at hand. The inevitable must be accepted and turned to advantage.","France has more need of me than I have need of France.","What is history but a fable agreed upon?","All religions have been made by men.","I love power. But it is as an artist that I love it. I love it as a musician loves his violin, to draw out its sounds and chords and harmonies.","The torment of precautions often exceeds the dangers to be avoided. It is sometimes better to abandon one's self to destiny.","The extent of your consciousness is limited only by your ability to love and to embrace with your love the space around you, and all it contains.","We must laugh at man to avoid crying for him.","A celebrated people lose dignity upon a closer view.","War is the business of barbarians.","He who fears being conquered is sure of defeat.","An army marches on its stomach.","I can no longer obey; I have tasted command, and I cannot give it up.","Courage is like love; it must have hope for nourishment.","I have only one counsel for you - be master.","Men are moved by two levers only: fear and self interest.","To do all that one is able to do, is to be a man; to do all that one would like to do, is to be a god.","There is only one step from the sublime to the ridiculous.","A revolution can be neither made nor stopped. The only thing that can be done is for one of several of its children to give it a direction by dint of victories.","Doctors will have more lives to answer for in the next world than even we generals.","There is one kind of robber whom the law does not strike at, and who steals what is most precious to men: time.","It requires more courage to suffer than to die.","If they want peace, nations should avoid the pin-pricks that precede cannon shots.","I am the successor, not of Louis XVI, but of Charlemagne.","A revolution is an idea which has found its bayonets.","A Constitution should be short and obscure.","A man cannot become an atheist merely by wishing it.","England is a nation of shopkeepers.","The human race is governed by its imagination.","Riches do not consist in the possession of treasures, but in the use made of them.","Ambition never is in a greater hurry than I; it merely keeps pace with circumstances and with my general way of thinking.","The infectiousness of crime is like that of the plague.","The French complain of everything, and always.","It is my wish that my ashes may repose on the banks of the Seine, in the midst of the French people, whom I have loved so well.","The act of policing is, in order to punish less often, to punish more severely.","Forethought we may have, undoubtedly, but not foresight.","Skepticism is a virtue in history as well as in philosophy.","You must not fear death, my lads; defy him, and you drive him into the enemy's ranks.","Let the path be open to talent.","When soldiers have been baptized in the fire of a battle-field, they have all one rank in my eyes.","The herd seek out the great, not for their sake but for their influence; and the great welcome them out of vanity or need.","Medicines are only fit for old people."],"Napoleon Hill":["Strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle.","Great achievement is usually born of great sacrifice, and is never the result of selfishness.","Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success.","Education comes from within; you get it by struggle and effort and thought.","Victory is always possible for the person who refuses to stop fighting.","The starting point of all achievement is desire.","If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.","Your big opportunity may be right where you are now.","Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit.","Think twice before you speak, because your words and influence will plant the seed of either success or failure in the mind of another.","First comes thought; then organization of that thought, into ideas and plans; then transformation of those plans into reality. The beginning, as you will observe, is in your imagination.","A goal is a dream with a deadline.","If you do not conquer self, you will be conquered by self.","Opportunity often comes disguised in the form of misfortune, or temporary defeat.","It takes half your life before you discover life is a do-it-yourself project.","Cherish your visions and your dreams as they are the children of your soul, the blueprints of your ultimate achievements.","Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit.","The man who does more than he is paid for will soon be paid for more than he does.","It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed.","Persistence is to the character of man as carbon is to steel.","When defeat comes, accept it as a signal that your plans are not sound, rebuild those plans, and set sail once more toward your coveted goal.","There are no limitations to the mind except those we acknowledge.","Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.","Desire is the starting point of all achievement, not a hope, not a wish, but a keen pulsating desire which transcends everything.","Action is the real measure of intelligence.","The ladder of success is never crowded at the top.","Procrastination is the bad habit of putting off until the day after tomorrow what should have been done the day before yesterday.","There is one quality which one must possess to win, and that is definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning desire to possess it.","You can start right where you stand and apply the habit of going the extra mile by rendering more service and better service than you are now being paid for.","Wise men, when in doubt whether to speak or to keep quiet, give themselves the benefit of the doubt, and remain silent.","What the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.","Happiness is found in doing, not merely possessing.","The world has the habit of making room for the man whose actions show that he knows where he is going.","We begin to see, therefore, the importance of selecting our environment with the greatest of care, because environment is the mental feeding ground out of which the food that goes into our minds is extracted.","The majority of men meet with failure because of their lack of persistence in creating new plans to take the place of those which fail.","Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure.","Edison failed 10,000 times before he made the electric light.

The time will never be just right.","All the breaks you need in life wait within your imagination, Imagination is the workshop of your mind, capable of turning mind energy into accomplishment and wealth.","You might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself.","Fears are nothing more than a state of mind.","Any idea, plan, or purpose may be placed in the mind through repetition of thought.","All achievements, all earned riches, have their beginning in an idea.","When your desires are strong enough you will appear to possess superhuman powers to achieve.","Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to cut all sources of retreat. Only by doing so can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a burning desire to win - essential to success.","Money without brains is always dangerous.","Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire and begin at once, whether you ready or not, to put this plan into action.","Before success comes in any man's life, he's sure to meet with much temporary defeat and, perhaps some failures. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit. That's exactly what the majority of men do.","Think and grow rich.","Everyone enjoys doing the kind of work for which he is best suited.","Understand this law and you will then know, beyond room for the slightest doubt, that you are constantly punishing yourself for every wrong you commit and rewarding yourself for every act of constructive conduct in which you indulge.","You give before you get.","The most interesting thing about a postage stamp is the persistence with which it sticks to its job.","Failure is nature's plan to prepare you for great responsibilities.","Man, alone, has the power to transform his thoughts into physical reality; man, alone, can dream and make his dreams come true.","Your ability to use the principle of autosuggestion will depend, very largely, upon your capacity to concentrate upon a given desire until that desire becomes a burning obsession.","You don't have to fear defeat if you believe it may reveal powers that you didn't know you possessed.","No man ever achieved worth-while success who did not, at one time or other, find himself with at least one foot hanging well over the brink of failure.","It is always your next move.","Ideas are the beginning points of all fortunes.","Nature cannot be tricked or cheated. She will give up to you the object of your struggles only after you have paid her price.","There is no such thing as Something for nothing.","No accurate thinker will judge another person by that which the other person's enemies say about him.","The battle is all over except the 'shouting' when one knows what is wanted and has made up his mind to get it, whatever the price may be.","More gold has been mined from the thoughts of men than has been taken from the earth.","War grows out of the desire of the individual to gain advantage at the expense of his fellow man.","No man can succeed in a line of endeavor which he does not like.","No man is ever whipped until he quits in his own mind.","If you must speak ill of another, do not speak it, write it in the sand near the water's edge.","Reduce your plan to writing. The moment you complete this, you will have definitely given concrete form to the intangible desire.","Big pay and little responsibility are circumstances seldom found together."],"Narada Michael Walden":["I'm very proud of my love for Whitney Houston. She really changed my life. She made my life a better life. She was so beautiful in her love for God, her love for her family and her love for music. She truly loved her music.

I didn't want to come here without the gift of music and God granted it to me.","I wanted to be Jimi Hendrix's drummer when I was in high school, but I graduated in 1970, the year he died.","Rock was always part of my heart and soul. But the times just changed and everybody wanted to dance.","A lot of artists don't like the sound of their voice. They're put off by it.","To be a superstar is incredible pressure. And also in our country, I'm going to speak about this, America. We have a way of kind of making it hard on our superstars. I don't sense it when I go to Europe or I go to Japan.","What Whitney Houston has accomplished will never be accomplished. She's the most famous person on the planet as far as vocaling and her songs. So I'm very happy that I can sit here and say I had a chance to know her. And I'm still dazed that she's gone. But she lives because her music is so powerful.","I first fell in love with music when I was a little boy. When I first heard music, I felt the beauty in it. Then, being able to tap along on a table top and box was great, but my favorite thing to do was to watch records spin. I would almost get hypnotized by it. These things are what drew me in initially.","White people couldn't do black music back in the day because they weren't funky or bad enough. They weren't from the ghettoes, but hip-hop and R&B changed all of that because white kids want to be down with it. They wanted to learn it so they studied the culture. It's kind of a cool thing because we shouldn't be so separate.","I believe as musicians and artists we have an obligation to our souls. What that is? Only each one of us knows. I can speak for myself and say my obligation is to be happy. When I'm happy, I make great music. When I'm unhappy and my heart is broken, I may make brokenhearted music, but it still sounds good.","I take jobs with people I admire, people with incredible talent who aren't necessarily big sellers.","I've known the glory of the stage and the glory of the spotlight. I still crave it. I want to be on 'American Bandstand' and 'Soul Train' as a solo artist. As a producer, songwriter and arranger, I help other artists say what they want to say. But on my records, I say what I want to say."],"Narciso Rodriguez":["My personal style is relaxed.","I've met so many who have opened doors for me and remained in my life both personally and professionally. After a while, networking doesn't feel like 'networking.' It's both serendipitous and unpredictable, and something that just naturally becomes part of your work life and your personal life.","When you're young and have the opportunity, it's crucial to learn as much as possible about your profession from every possible angle.","The thing about Parsons compared to the other schools is that it really teaches you how to be a designer, whereas some of the other schools teach you to sketch or teach you the technical skills. But the curriculum at Parsons when I was there was how do you put a collection together, as well as all the technical stuff. It's the best training.","There's a spirit of Latina women in all of my work, in the love of the body and the strong sense of self.","I love the scent of jasmine, honeysuckle, and orange blossom. They remind me of gardens and visits to the ocean I would make as a boy.","No scent is more sensual or more memorable to me than musk.","Latin men love Latin women, it is part of the culture, we celebrate women in a very special way and I think that is present in my work. I do it by making them beautiful, sensual.","My parents never understood why I didn't want to be a doctor or lawyer. They're Cuban immigrants who wanted to give their children the American dream, and, to them, that was more of what 'the dream' entailed.","I love boliche, roasted pig, and black beans and rice. When I need a quick fix, I head to Cafe Cortadito on Avenue B and 3rd here in New York City.","I realize that I live in the same environment that I did when I was a kid, but with less junk and better art.","When I was about 13, I met the coolest, chicest young woman I had ever seen. She was a neighbor of mine who became a fashion designer and had a small design studio. She taught me so many things about style and fashion. I had always loved making things, so when she told me about her career in fashion, I knew I had found my path.","You may grow very quickly the first two years and then watch the business decline, unless you really start selling product at any price range with various degrees of quality.","Because I'm so hands on here at work and always looking at fabrics you have to be mobile and as comfortable as possible.","Once winter sets in I must have the sun and warmth. I need to be in the sun - I'm a true island baby.","I was always fascinated by graphic art and typography and architecture. And so I was constantly cutting things and making blocks and making buildings out of shoeboxes.","I think more and more that I get to challenge myself and kind of raise the standard for myself every season. Even the term 'fashion' is about change. It's about newness. And what that newness means is different every 10 years, every five years.","Many of my clients have become close friends, and that informs the clothing I design for them. Julianna Margulies was introduced to me by her publicist many years ago, and we've been good friends ever since.","When I graduated from Parsons School of Design, the dean at that time said I would never be a designer. Obviously I didn't listen.","I owe my career to Latina women. I was surrounded by the amazing group: my mother, my aunts, my extended family. They didn't necessarily have access to high fashion, but they had great style and looked stunning naturally at every age.","I invited a group of students to my studio to expose them to both the creative and business sides of the fashion industry. It was fun because the group was so bright and full of curiosity. They asked really challenging questions about all aspects of the business and absorbed so much information so quickly.","The moment I moved to New York City to study fashion, I met and became friends with people not only involved in fashion but in all the arts. It's quite fluid with so many types of artists, designers, and musicians who know each other through collaborations or friends of friends.","I'm a great fan of Bloomingdale's, and I'm a very loyal alumni of Parsons. I think what they do, what they've done, is amazing. They've educated some of the best American designers.","I got to train with some of the best and have critics like Oscar de la Renta and Calvin Klein. As a student under Calvin Klein, my project was to make a coat, and then years later, I was hired at Calvin, by Calvin, to design coats for him. It came full circle!","I went to Parsons, and I interned with Ronen when I was at Parsons. We started our own company since then.","It's so great to see a woman dressed in jeans and a lace-up boot with an extraordinary jacket. It's a moment where you do want to mix high and low, and it's not so much about a head-to-toe designer look."],"Narendra Modi":["Good governance with good intentions is the hallmark of our government. Implementation with integrity is our core passion.","The diversity of India, of our civilization, is actually a thing of beauty, which is something we are extremely proud of.","All religions and all communities have the same rights, and it is my responsibility to ensure their complete and total protection. My government will not tolerate or accept any discrimination based on caste, creed and religion.","Social media is reducing social barriers. It connects people on the strength of human values, not identities.","We walk together, we move together, we think together, we resolve together, and together we take this country forward.","I believe mutual respect for one another and cooperation should be the basis for relationships with foreign nations.","Tourism provides employment to the poorest of the poor. Gram seller earns something, auto-rickshaw driver earns something, pakoda seller earns something, and tea seller also earns something.","My government is working for the common man. Our priority is the poor of the country. We want good governance through a dynamic and seamless government.","We will explore the mysteries of science and harness the power of technology and innovation. We will realise the opportunities of the digital world. Our youth will learn more from - and with - each other.","I come from a poor family, I have seen poverty. The poor need respect, and it begins with cleanliness.","I found that the corridors of power in Delhi were littered with lobbies of various kinds.","People's blessings give you the power to work tirelessly. The only thing required is commitment.","America has absorbed people from around the world, and there is an Indian in every part of the world. This characterizes both the societies. Indians and Americans have co-existed in their natural temperament.","The pace at which people are taking to digital technology defies our stereotypes of age, education, language and income.","We want an Afghanistan that is shaped by the dreams of the great Afghan people, not by irrational fears and overreaching ambitions of others.","Information, education, skills, healthcare, livelihood, financial inclusion, small and village enterprises, opportunities for women, conservation of natural resources, distributed clean energy - entirely new possibilities have emerged to change the development model.","I don't carry the burden of the past or the madness of the future. I live in the present.","I do take pride in saying that in spite of being in public life for so long, there is not a single case against me, not even for wrongly parking a scooter or driving on the wrong side.","Even in this globalised world, London is still the standard for our times. The city has embraced the world's diversity and represents the finest in human achievements.","In the political system, we are a team; politics and bureaucracy, we are a team. The politicians, bureaucrats and the people, we are a team.","Indians felt despondent about Indian governance. Changing that atmosphere of gloom was a very challenging task, and I faced many difficulties in rectifying the situation and bringing back confidence and hope.","If you call yourself a leader, then you have to be decisive. If you're decisive, then you have the chance to be a leader. These are two sides to the same coin.","I have always believed in evolving a consensus before taking any major decision.","I can say that out of 365 days, I manage to do yoga on at least 300 days.","The government has completed the entire process to do away with interviews for lower rank jobs. There will be no requirement of interview for Group D,C and B non-gazetted posts in central government.","I was born in a very poor family. I used to sell tea in a railway coach as a child. My mother used to wash utensils and do lowly household work in the houses of others to earn a livelihood. I have seen poverty very closely. I have lived in poverty. As a child, my entire childhood was steeped in poverty.","For me, my secularism is, India first. I say, the philosophy of my party is 'Justice to all. Appeasement to none.' This is our secularism.","I'm a nationalist. I'm a patriot. Nothing is wrong. I'm a born Hindu. Nothing is wrong. So, I'm a Hindu nationalist, so yes, you can say I'm a Hindu nationalist because I am a born Hindu, I'm patriotic, so nothing is wrong in it.","Our constitution is a ray of hope: H for harmony, O for Opportunity, P for people's participation and E for equality.","Much of India that we dream of still lies ahead of us: housing, power, water and sanitation for all; bank accounts and insurance for every citizen; connected and prosperous villages; and, smart and sustainable cities.","A national festival is an occasion to refine and rebuild the national character.","So far as the government is concerned, there is only one holy book, which is the constitution of India. My government will not tolerate or accept any discrimination based on caste, creed and religion.","We will naturally pursue our goals on the strength of our own resources, skills and enterprise. But, we know that we will be more successful when we do this in partnership with the world.","Federalism is no longer the fault line of Centre-State relations but the definition of a new partnership of Team India. Citizens now have the ease of trust, not the burden of proof and process. Businesses find an environment that is open and easy to work in.","We should not look at terrorism from the nameplates - which group they belong to, what is their geographical location, who are the victims. These individual groups or names will keep changing.","India does not need to become anything else. India must become only India. This is a country that once upon a time was called the golden bird.","Our country does not believe in the concept of your God and my God. We believe that all gods are one. We have different ways of accepting Him. All ways lead to Him.","I believe you never get tired by doing work. You get tired when you don't work. When you clean your house, you don't get tired; it gives you satisfaction.","The Make in India campaign has taken off and is backed with skill development. It is going to open new vistas for employment for the youth.","Unless and until you inspire the people, you will not get results. Imposition will never give you the results. Inspiration will always give you the results.","We should work with the principle that a work that can be done at a lower level should never be escalated to a higher level.","Democracy is our commitment. It is our great legacy, a legacy we simply cannot compromise. Democracy is in our DNA.","E-governance is easy governance, effective governance, and also economic governance. E-governance paves the way for good governance.","The progress of India is the destiny of one-sixth of humanity. And it will also mean a world more confident of its prosperity and more secure about its future.","If I had chosen the populist course, it would have been a breach of the trust placed in me by the people.","We live in an inter-dependent world. An isolated India is not in our interest.","I believe that a government has only one religion - India first. A government has only one holy book - our Constitution. A government has only one kind of devotion - towards nation.","I will meet my countrymen. I understand only one language: that they are my countrymen, they are my brothers. You may see with whatever colour you want; Modi will not go into that colour.","I like to combine visits to more than one place when I go on my international tours in order to get more done. I'm from Ahmedabad where we have a saying, 'Single-fare, double journey.'","Indians invest more in Britain than in the rest of European Union combined. It is not because they want to save on interpretation costs, but because they find an environment that is welcoming and familiar.","When you think of the exponential speed and scale of expansion of social media or a service, you have to believe that it is equally possible to rapidly transform the lives of those who have long stood on the margins of hope.","We should not look at terrorism from the nameplates - which group they belong to, what is their geographical location, who are the victims. These individual groups or names will keep changing. Today you are looking at the Taliban or ISIS; tomorrow you might be looking at another name.","We should pass the U.N.'s Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. At least it will clearly establish whom you view as a terrorist and whom you don't. We need to delink terrorism from religion - to isolate terrorists who use this interchange of arguments between terrorism and religion.","India is a democracy; it is in our DNA.","From my intimate discussions with President Obama, it is evident that India figures significantly in American geo-political, economic and strategic thinking. India is the largest democracy in the world.","I always say the strength of democracy lies in criticism. If there is no criticism, that means there is no democracy. And if you want to grow, you must invite criticism. And I want to grow; I want to invite criticism.","I'm not in favour of dividing Hindus and Sikhs. I'm not in favour of dividing Hindus and Christians. All the citizens, all the voters, are my countrymen.","I'm not an ambitious person, there is no ambition in my life. I have a mission in my life. And my mission is to serve my country. And when I am working for my state, it means I am working for my country, or my nation.","I'm committed to the people of Gujarat. I will devote each and every moment to serve my people of Gujarat.","Gujarat is the fourth state in the world where we have a separate climate-change department.","I draw pleasure in governance, in doing new things and bringing people together. That pleasure is all I need from life.","If you were to ask me to choose between democratic values and wealth, power, prosperity and fame, I will very easily and without any doubt choose democratic values.","Our vision and commitment is towards the country's progress, its place in the world and the happiness of its people.","The government's job is good governance for everybody. My government will make policies; if you fit into it, come on board, or stay where you are. My job is not to spoon-feed anyone.","In a democracy, allegations will never improve situations. So, I'm against allegations, but I always welcome criticism.","Before I became a chief minister, I never thought that one day I'd be the chief minister.","Peace can only thrive when the climate is right. We remain open to bilateral dialogue with Pakistan on all outstanding issues in an environment free from terrorism and violence.","France and Germany have the manufacturing and skill base which is useful to us. France is our dependable strategic partner.","We would like a stable policy framework, and whatever incentives and tax structures are there should be made known to investors upfront. There should be credibility, clarity and continuity in both policy formulation and its implementation.","I fully understand the expectations of the state governments. Thus, I am better placed to work closely with the chief ministers.","I have been a firm believer in the federal structure of our country as enshrined in the Constitution.","My entire childhood was steeped in poverty. For me, poverty, in a way, was the first inspiration of my life, a commitment to do something for the poor.","Some people will have to be afraid. Those who plunder the nation, deliver injustice, will have to feel scared of me. And I am not afraid of admitting this. Government cannot be so lenient that it forgives them.","I am the son of a freedom fighter, and a son of a freedom fighter automatically imbibes the value of democracy.","Whatever work you do, you think are you doing this for the good of the nation? That's the basic training. The other basic training is discipline. Your life should be disciplined. The other thing they say is what work you get, do it well.","In every walk of life, you must have leaders. An education in the spiritual world, in the labor field, in the agricultural field, we must have leaders.","Canada is rich in hydrocarbons and other natural resources... India's requirements and Canada's surplus are a perfect match.","The alliance in Jammu and Kashmir is one of the most important developments on the contemporary political scene.","One of the peculiarities of Delhi is that the term 'reform' is associated only with passing of laws in Parliament. In fact, the most important reforms are those needed, without new laws, at various level of the government, in work practices and procedures.","I am confident my Hindutva face will be an asset when dealing with foreign affairs with other nations.","If I am judged for my work, many myths about me as an autocrat or otherwise would become clearer. I feel false propaganda will not last, and truth will ultimately prevail.","I doubt anyone else would have travelled as extensively as I have to meet the citizens of the country.","I have spoken about inflation, unemployment, farmers' problems, security, etc. I keep talking about these issues. I seek answers from the Indian government.","I am most familiar with the Gujarati language.","I have been into social work since 45 years, and at an average, every day for one or two hours, I have been engaging in social discourses. It is not a small thing.","We have to build the capacity of our institutions, employees and workers. Our regulatory environment has not been encouraging to research, innovation and enterprise.","International summits and organisations like WTO take decisions, which will bind us, and if we are not present in such summits, we may be hurt by the decisions taken.","Nobody is above the law. Imagine if there allegations against Modi and he is the Prime Minister. Should the case not be pursued just because he has become the PM. It should not be so that it should be stopped. I am not above the law.","It is my responsibility that I must make demonstrative efforts to reach out to every citizen of the country.","I have worked hard since my childhood and worked as a labourer. I put my mind and heart into it.","When the party gives me a responsibility, I must do it with complete dedication. God has given me the ability, which I utilise to its optimum.","It is my absolute belief that Indians have unlimited talent. I have no doubt about our capabilities.","I believe growth should be constant, sustained and inclusive. It's only meaningful if these three things are there. Otherwise they're just economic figures.","The power and energy sectors are the biggest constituents of the infrastructure sector. If you ignore them, no development will happen.","When you bring in multi-brand retail items into the country, you're not just bringing the products, but you're also harming local manufacturers.","I will only say that many freedom fighters of India found their calling in the institutions of Britain. And many makers of modern India, including several of my distinguished predecessors, from Jawaharlal Nehru to Dr. Manmohan Singh, passed through their doors.","The fault lines are shifting from the boundaries of nations into the web of our societies and the streets of our cities. And, terrorism and extremism are a global force that are larger than their changing names, groups, territories and targets.","The world has crafted a beautiful balance of collective action - common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities.","My mother is not educated but keeps in touch with world events through news on TV.","When I came to Delhi and noticed an insider view, I felt what it was, and I was surprised to see it. It seemed as if dozens of separate governments are running at the same time in one main government. It appeared that everyone has its own fiefdom.","In order to fulfill the aspirations of masses, we have to sharpen the tool called the government machinery: we have to make it keen, more dynamic, and it is in this direction that we are working.","Even after Independence, we have had to face the poison of casteism and communalism. How long these evils will continue? Whom does it benefit?","The world may be driven by the same ancient impulses. We will continue to see human struggles and successes. We will witness human glory and tragedies.","We want to free our citizens from the burden of excessive paper documents in every office. We want paperless transactions. We will set up a digital locker for every citizen to store personal documents that can be shared across departments.","We must ensure that technology is accessible, affordable, and adds value."],"Nargis Fakhri":["In this hectic life, we have no time to take care of ourselves, hence massage is needed for rejuvenation and stress reduction. A lot of people are looking for quick fixes: like, they are taking medications, and they are doing other things which are not healthy. But massage is very holistic and natural.","At the end of the day, the one commonality that both Hindi cinema and Hollywood share is that they are full of talented and inspirational people. Outside of this, there are many differences, from the scheduling and rehearsal to promotion and directing techniques.","Hard work and dedication is important to success, and I have those qualities.","I pride myself on my personilty and not my looks because one day, I will be old and crusty with a moustache, and someone is going to love me for my personality and not looks. So whoever is going to marry me is going to laugh till he dies.","My motto is never to hold on to anything. I accept and then let go: not just the negatives, but the praise, too. Or it'll get to my head.","I am a romantic, and I think dates are wonderful. I like quirky and fun things. Like going for a bike ride or for a pedicure together.","Every friendship is different because everyone's personality is different.","For me, fashion means dare. I don't mind wearing a bikini. I am okay with it.","Ritesh Deshmukh is rock star. He has a lovely family. He works so hard, and he's a great actor. He's funny, friendly, doesn't have an ego, and is so nice to everyone. He's a fine professional, a good husband, and a good father. That's a rock star for me.","I think massage is a very important part of life, which is present from centuries as an imminent part of India's tradition.","I think being directed and mentored by someone as inspirational as Paul Feig not only improves my performance but, as a whole, makes it what it is.","I had to struggle with the language. I can understand Hindi now, but I still can't communicate. And things get lost in translation; I feel rejected all the time.","To kill yourself for earning a salary is not worth it.","Keep your energy levels high by adding bananas and egg whites to your diet.","I like to start my day with a glass of coconut water, some protein powder, and a mix of things - goji berries, flax seeds, hemp seeds, even the flesh of a coconut or anything with a lot of fibre. I often add bananas, or eggs - fried or boiled - to my breakfast.","You should never go on diet and must follow a healthy lifestyle.","I've experienced wrong diagnoses and been given antibiotics for things that could be cured naturally. We may not think much of it, but it destroys our immunity.","I come from a culture where we wear white for weddings. In India, it's different. But I really feel that there should be no set notions, and a bride should only wear something when she's comfortable in it.","I am not into marriage. You look at all the marriages breaking down and all the people cheating on their marriages, and you become cynical. Marriage is nothing but a label.","I was 16 when I started modelling. It wasn't planned, but nothing in my life has or ever will be planned.","Courtship is like simmering mutton. You cook for hours and hours to taste the soft meat. It doesn't happen in two seconds!","I don't consider myself as a glamour diva. If you get to know me, you will see that I am so dorky and weird.","I firmly believe that one of the best kept secrets to soft and glowing skin is moisturisation.","No matter where I travel, I make sure to carry a Vaseline body lotion with me to keep my skin well moisturised all the time.","For me, life is about experiencing many new things and working with good people, working on good projects, and in general, just having any kind of job.","I'm usually always very happy and funny and positive. It's only when I'm tired that I get a little low energy.","It took me just three months to pick up Hindi. I guess I'm a fast learner when it comes to languages.","Stereotyping of any race or culture is narrow-minded, and I can't wait to help break the shackles.","I would like to be more fit, but I don't think I will put on fat or gain weight for movie roles. I am not going to do that.","My sister and I had a tough childhood, but my mom always said that travelling is the most beautiful thing you can do in your life. She always showed us the globe and gifted me an atlas.","No, I don't have a plan. Whatever happens happens. There's never a plan.","Don't be surprised if you find me doing some charity work in another country.","I'm tired of the speculation about my personal life.","I am not saying one is better than the other. I enjoy both. But Hollywood is far more organised than Bollywood.","I'm a little weird that way. I don't really know how to express my happiness.","Some critics have been very harsh. That's okay. I like honest criticism.","I know I'm not the consummate Bollywood heroine. But I'm working hard on it.","I don't think about it. I have always been linked up with everybody.","I have a variety of styles. I don't stick to one particular style.","You learn to be comfortable with your body. It's fine and not a big deal.","Drink lots of water and stay hydrated.","It's something I am confident about. It gives me an adrenaline rush - who wouldn't want want to wear beautiful clothes and jewellery and look wonderful - it's a dream job for many.","I'm intrigued by traditional Indian designs. They are so beautifully handcrafted, and the designs are so intricate and beautiful. I really prefer the Indian designs.","I like to wear jewellery, even though I like my look to be minimalist. When I go out for events, I like to have at least one statement piece. It always adds glamour.","I don't want to be known as an item dancer. I want to be known as an actress only.","Dance is something which I like to do, but acting is my passion. I would like to do good and meaty roles.","I have learned so much from India: for instance, the use of aloe vera, which I use, and I find it sad when I see certain arts of oiling slowly fading away.","I use coconut oil every single day. I apply coconut oil on my whole body for moisturising. The oil can also be used as make-up remover, as it is light-based and is not sticky.","I'm really excited about furthering my film career in Bollywood and Hollywood.","Health and well-being, as well as how we can live in harmony with our planet, is something I'm passionate about.","Fair treatment of human beings and animals in many different realms strikes a chord with me.","I think that, occasionally, fame and popularity can garner more attention for individuals or films. But as a person who believes in my craft, I like the romantic notion that skill and hard work is more important than notoriety.","I think I am feeling comfortable in Bollywood more than in Hollywood because I have spent more time here now and I am understanding a lot of things. I am feeling pretty good here. I really don't plan on running off anywhere.","I always wanted to do a bit of Bollywood and a bit of Hollywood.","I like to take my own time, and I don't like to rush. I do take time, and I have patience.","I have worked with the biggest actors from the beginning. I am hoping God will bless me to work with other big actors.","With Pakistan being in my blood, I would certainly look at opportunities to travel there.","I believe that, as actors, we have a phenomenal platform to spread positivity and influence people in the same way.","In a time where there are divides between cultures and races, I would love to use my position to show that we are all the same inside and working together is the key to moving forward.","I am an independent, educated woman, I make my own money, take care of my mom, and I am single, so I can do whatever I want, taking no one's permission, and that is the best part.","Even though my parents separated, my mother was in love with my father and never re-married.","I was tall and skinny, and at 15, I was approached to model. I figured that models got to travel, and it became my ticket to travel so much so that if an agency could not fly me to another country, I would fly on my cost so that I could see that country and also make some money.","I got a lot of offers after 'Rockstar' but was totally dependent on the team managing my work, who did not want me to sign any of the films I was offered, even though I wanted to.","Uday Chopra is a person who will be a part of my life for the rest of my life. He is the most amazing human being who I have ever met in my entire life - not just in India, but around the world. If anyone is his friend, that person is lucky to have him in his life.","I crack jokes all the time. Even when I have a fight, I will make a joke, and people will laugh.","I've learnt some important lessons: I never rely on the opinion of one doctor alone. I do my own research; I read up and am ready with questions I need answered.","I have vowed never to take antibiotics again unless I really need them. I also learned to pay attention to my body, know the difference between indigestion, an allergic reaction to food, a parasitic infection or worms. It's incredible how well I know my body. I really love that.","I don't eat white breads, and I'm off dairy due to an allergic reaction and because of what it does to the body. I've learnt a lot about different foods and how the body breaks it down and what happens when we eliminate or incorporate certain foods, and it's pretty fascinating!","My mother is happy with whatever I choose to do in life as long as I'm happy, healthy, and safe.","I don't really know what the prerequisites are for Bollywood, but I do believe I can be successful in anything I choose to do.","My priority is the script. Get me a good script, and I will sign the movie. I think I should leave the casting up to the experts!","In Bollywood, they like to put us in short clothes. And I am very shy; I don't like wearing revealing stuff, though my image is such. Unfortunately, it's a body-obsessed industry.","It has been a tumultuous journey, no doubt. But I feel blessed to have got work.","I feel like an alien. I feel people don't like me. People behaved strangely after 'Rockstar.'","My mum was born in the former Czechoslovakia, and even though my grandparents weren't wealthy, they were aristocrats in their time.","I grew up in the projects in Queens, and we were really poor.","When I was 12, my mum put us in a summer camp meant for children from low-income families. It was in upstate New York where we had to live in tents, fetch water, cook our meals, and even dig our own toilet bowls.","I did a B.A. with a major in fine arts and a minor in psychology. I wanted to become a teacher or do art therapy for the elderly. But then I realised I wanted to travel instead."],"Nas":["I want to have fun. It's a beautiful life. You learn, you win, you lose, but you get up.","Once you make it to your point of making it, you'll appreciate the struggle.","I just enjoy life now. I just enjoy every morning I get to wake up.","Working with great people makes you great; you learn a lot and it also gives you the experience and confidence to move on with your own career.","I don't want any title. I just say what I say, and hopefully somebody gets it, man. I'm not perfect, and I'm just here and trying to make a dollar, and being real at the same time, you know?","Your look reflects what's happening in your mind. You gotta have some swag to you.","The flaws, the mistakes I make - that's the real me.","'Life Is Good' represents the most beautiful, dramatic and heavy moments in my life.","You can't please everybody. You'd be crazy if you're trying to. So take some time out to do some things for yourself.","Some people say I'm conscious, some say I'm a gangsta rapper - it's just me doing me. I'm stomping in my own lane. I'm doing what I do.","Hip-hop is the streets. Hip-hop is a couple of elements that it comes from back in the days... that feel of music with urgency that speaks to you. It speaks to your livelihood and it's not compromised. It's blunt. It's raw, straight off the street - from the beat to the voice to the words.","I think if I heard someone else talking about their life, describing all the problems I've had, they'd look like they were through. Done. But there's something about me - I'm smiling. Those things are really not bad enough to put me in a slump. I'm smiling with the opportunity to wake up every morning.","Every generation witnesses atrocities. People in power try to fulfill prophecy.","With age comes common sense and wisdom.","I don't get jealousy, I don't get how people hate each other - I never did.","I wish the music business was a much easier thing, but you know what? Nothing easy is worth anything. So it is what it is. There comes a time when things can work out and everybody can be happy. And that's what it's all about in the end - everybody being happy and working it out.","Anybody I'm dating, I don't want them to talk about my music. I don't talk about my music to them.","I think hip-hop could help rebuild America, once hip-hoppers own hip-hop... We are our own politicians, our own government, we have something to say. We're warriors. Soldiers.","I don't have time for the news clippings. I got my own mission.","I can't control what people think. They know who I am.","DJs play a big responsibility of what hip-hop is doing... At the end of the day, it's up to us to control and to own hip-hop. DJs need to challenge us rappers. They got so much power, they need to challenge us.","Anybody can be a rapper, but not anybody can be a classical artist.","The sound of the '90s, to me, is a combination of soul and street - it's a feeling.","When you have a daughter, you want to protect her from the things that I've seen out there, you know, the things that's out there that ain't good for her. It's a crazy world we live in.","My earliest memories of rap music was mixed with my earliest memories of reggae music. They were big sounds around the way, heavy bass lines, strong messages, definitely.","I think the hip-hop purists are purists through and through. They're here to criticize all of us. That's just how it is. We as MC's criticize each other. That's the nature of hip-hop.","We're all Africans, everyone - black, white, yellow.","I don't go out unless I'm working. My quality time is when I'm doing nothing.","I have no tattoos that I regret - I have had some that I have had changed according to how my life was.","Hip-hop is bigger than the South; hip-hop is bigger than New York.","I think marriage is a beautiful thing. I'm still a supporter of it.","All fatherhood is very important because single mothers shouldn't have to raise sons or daughters; they need that help.","I'm not talking about Russia in my music. I've never been to Russia. I'm not talking about Africa, Switzerland, China. I'm talking about me being American and growing up in a crazy world and helping to reflect all different sides of life.","I had a pretty public divorce. They're not easy - divorces - and it took me a long time to really get through.","I'm just little me, an American who wants to see his country do better.","My record company had to beg me to stop filmin' music videos in the projects. No matter what the song was about, I had 'em out there.","Man, me and Biggie were the biggest artists in New York. When he passed, I was so messed up. My attitude was messed up about him dying. There was an East-West thing back then, and I was in war mode.","I love PBS! I grew up on it. If I had to say which channels were good, I'd say, you got your PBS, your History Channel, your Discovery.","When you're a teenager, you want to meet a lot of girls - you want to get the most girls. You don't know anything about respect; you don't know anything about being faithful and loyal to your girlfriend.","Hip-hop is really standoffish. It's really competitive and it's really about who's number one all the time. Sometimes it gets out of hand.","To me, creatively challenging myself is my version of owning the Nets.","I've been called everything. Gangsta rap. I've been called conscious rap. You know, everything. Whoever feels like calling it whatever they want to call it, that's on them.","Every time I get in the studio, I feel like I wanna have some fun. My fun is not doing the easy work. My fun is doing what's me.","Whenever I received too much praise, it just didn't feel right to me - ever.","You know, rap is sort of like a form of talking, right? So it's like you can hear, you know, the slaves doing it. You can hear, like, you know, Africans and Jamaicans doing it just kind of as, like, a rhythmic, poetic conversation, you know, to a rhythm.","Marley is someone before his time, man. He's - he's almost - he's like a deity, like almost, you know what I mean? I just talk about what's going on, but of course, you know, Bob, before rappers, was already laying that kind of thing down.","Hip-hop lasted and survived all these years that you have to give it credit. Even though it's not up to people's expectations anymore, its still here, and that's says a lot.","There was a side of me that knew I was gonna change the game, but I didn't know how many people would respect it.","'Stillmatic' is the rebirth of 'Illmatic,' my first debut album to come out in 1994. 'Stillmatic' is me coming full circle in my career and with everything, and just bringing pure hip-hop back.","Hip-hop artists, especially the older ones, are the ones who knew hip-hop was a worldwide phenomenon before the mainstream caught on, so hip-hop artists are forward thinkers. We want to stay with the new.","No one's promised anything. You could have the biggest record on radio and sell no records.","I think the fact that I made enough noise in the world that I might be remembered is an amazing achievement. You can't ask for more than that.","I want to sound like an instrument. I want my voice and my words to marry the beat. I go with the rhythm of it and the words start to come to my mind and those words could be based on things that's been on my mind for the past year, the past month, the past week, whatever; I write it.","Hip-hop is making a lot of noise. It should get some more spotlight.","Let's not forget, art can sell. You ain't gotta front all the time on your records.","I'll always love rap, no matter what's going on.","I like the way hip-hop is now. It's grown up enough so that it can get involved with politics if it feels like it.","I love the art world, I love art galleries, I love what it means - I love art.","I think I've had the longest career of strength, focus, and still being able to sell records. I think I'm that guy. I'm still blessed with the opportunity to make music and pass out a message like, 'Life is good,' to the world.","I never stood for any president in my life, never voted, before Barack Obama. It changed my life to vote. It starts there with me. I never cared for politics before Barack Obama. I never thought it mattered to people like me.","Divorce can be crazy. Man, if you're happy... Love is a beast, man. Hold on. Be prepared for any way it may go, and be honest.","I talk about life, and I make universal music with an American style - and that's what I do.","When I say 'hip-hop is dead,' basically, America is dead. There is no political voice. Music is dead.","The things that I have said when I was young and curious about whatever the subject matter was, I respect those - those are growing pains. Even if you make mistakes, I go back to those things, my not-so-great moments because those are my truest moments; those are my human moments. I'm not even mad at the things I said that were a little dicey.","I definitely have plans to do more collaboration albums in the future. I'm a big fan of Common. I'm a big fan of Scarface; I'm a big fan of so many people, from Jeezy to... well, there are a lot of people's music that I respect. I don't know who I will collaborate with, but there's a great chance of something happening.","GaGa is one of my favourites. Her voice is incredible and she's fearless and she's ahead of the game. She's ahead of the entire game, and I admire that.","Africa has been going through so much for so many years; it's time that it stands up the way other nations are standing up.","No matter who you are, black, white, green, there's going to be things in your way, you know what I mean?","I see N.Y. hip-hop like I see N.Y. streets. N.Y. streets are grimy; it's a grind. N.Y. rappers are hustlers - whatever sound is in, we can adapt to that; there's nothing wrong with that.","N.Y. hip-hop is ok, but we gotta become brave again; we have to be brave enough and do something new - that's what New York is about... New.","Calling Michelle 'Obama Barack's baby mama?' Tell me, is that acceptable? But the Obamas aren't the only targets. Fox's pattern of race-baiting and fear-mongering regularly focuses on black leaders, black institutions and ordinary black people.","It's never been seen that a street artist go as far as I've gone - keep consistent without wanting to do a bunch of ventures outside of music to keep my face out there.","Unfortunately, man, a lot of places in America have to deal with unnecessary violence. Somebody like me who knows it firsthand and could relate... I had a best friend killed, plenty other friends killed. I been through it. I seen it."],"Nash Grier":["I accept you, and you get the same respect from me whether you are black, white, gay straight, Asian, bisexual, Australian, tall, fat, whatever it is. We are all people, and I look at the people of the world the same way, as my brothers and sisters.","As humans, we're going to make mistakes. It's what makes us human, and most of the time, the most effective way of learning is from a mistake.","Be happy. Don't make a Vine about, like, something not that happy.","Designing a collection with Aeropostale was completely surreal.","You can play professional lacrosse, but they make less than a teacher's salary now. I always thought about that. And it's a very difficult career, a short career, as a pro athlete.","Don't limit your audience.","I like being the center of attention. I want to be in the limelight, basically.","When people say 'that's risky,' or when the odds are not in my favor, I'm more motivated than ever.","I love entertaining people, and I want to pursue it.","I'm not 'Will's brother' anymore. Will is my brother. I'm paving the way for all middle children out there.","Towards the end of summer 2013, when school ended, I decided to re-download all of my social media channels and make videos again. The next day, I woke up and had 9,000 followers. I did the same thing the next day and woke up with 54,000 followers.","Many of my early Vines and collaborations were with gay people."],"Nasim Pedrad":["I knew at a young age that I wanted to do comedy, and maybe part of that was trying to fit in at school because I had a weird name, and my parents had these accents, and I was definitely a late bloomer.","I really looked up to Tina Fey as a writer, and because I did have a background in writing, she is someone whose career I really did admire.","I can easily connect with the prepubescent dork I spent much of my life being."],"Nassau William Senior":["One of the worst of errors would be the general admission of the proposition that a Government has no right to interfere for any purpose except for that of affording protection.","But that the reasoning from these facts, the drawing from them correct conclusions, is a matter of great difficulty, may be inferred from the imperfect state in which the Science is now found after it has been so long and so intensely studied.","Our object in these remarks has been not only to account for the slow progress which has as yet been made by Political Economy, and to suggest means by which its advancement may be accelerated, but also to warn the reader of the nature of the following Treatise.","That every person is desirous to obtain, with as little sacrifice as possible, as much as possible of the articles of wealth.","That the powers of labour, and of the other instruments which produce wealth, may be indefinitely increased by using their products as the means of further production.","The business of a Political Economist is neither to recommend nor to dissuade, but to state general principles, which it is fatal to neglect, but neither advisable, nor perhaps practicable, to use as the sole, or even the principal, guides in the actual conduct of affairs.","The confounding Political Economy with the Sciences and Arts to which it is subservient, has been one of the principal obstacles to its improvement.","The first, or theoretic branch, that which explains the nature, production, and distribution of wealth, will be found to rest on a very few general propositions, which are the result of observation, or consciousness.","The payment made by a manufacturer to a patentee for the privilege of using the patent process, is usually termed, in commercial language, a rent; and under the same head must be ranked all extraordinary qualities of body and mind.","The time I trust will come, perhaps within the lives of some of us, when the outline of this science will be clearly made out and generally recognised, when its nomenclature will be fixed, and its principles form a part of elementary instruction.","Value denotes a relation reciprocally existing between two objects, and the precise relation which it denotes is the quantity of the one which can be obtained in exchange for a given quantity of the other.","We propose in the following Treatise to give an outline of the Science which treats of the Nature, the Production, and the Distribution of Wealth. To that Science we give the name of Political Economy.","With respect to the first of these obstacles, it has often been made a matter of grave complaint against Political Economists, that they confine their attention to Wealth, and disregard all consideration of Happiness or Virtue."],"Nassim Nicholas Taleb":["Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg didn't finish college. Too much emphasis is placed on formal education - I told my children not to worry about their grades but to enjoy learning.","Banking is a very treacherous business because you don't realize it is risky until it is too late. It is like calm waters that deliver huge storms.","Never think that lack of variability is stability. Don't confuse lack of volatility with stability, ever.","If you take risks and face your fate with dignity, there is nothing you can do that makes you small; if you don't take risks, there is nothing you can do that makes you grand, nothing.","Never take advice from anyone in a tie. They'll bankrupt you. Don't ask a general for advice on war, and don't ask a broker for advice on money.","We have this culture of financialization. People think they need to make money with their savings rather with their own business. So you end up with dentists who are more traders than dentists. A dentist should drill teeth and use whatever he does in the stock market for entertainment.","The next time you experience a blackout, take some solace by looking at the sky. You will not recognize it.","You will get the most attention from those who hate you. No friend, no admirer and no partner will flatter you with as much curiosity.","Fragility is the quality of things that are vulnerable to volatility.","Capitalism has forced everyone to overoptimize in order to compete.","Years ago, I noticed one thing about economics, and that is that economists didn't get anything right.","When you write, you don't have the social constraints of having people in front of you, so you talk about abstract matters.","I lift heavy weights and sprint, but I am so bad at it that I develop severe injuries.","Failure saves lives. In the airline industry, every time a plane crashes the probability of the next crash is lowered by that. The Titanic saved lives because we're building bigger and bigger ships. So these people died, but we have effectively improved the safety of the system, and nothing failed in vain.","There are two types of people: those who try to win and those who try to win arguments. They are never the same.","We know from chaos theory that even if you had a perfect model of the world, you'd need infinite precision in order to predict future events. With sociopolitical or economic phenomena, we don't have anything like that.","All of technology, really, is about maximizing free options.","If you are in banking and lending, surprise outcomes are likely to be negative for you.","What we do today has nothing to do with capitalism or socialism. It is a crony type of system that transfers money to the coffers of bureaucrats.","For many people, commuting is the worst part of the day, and policies that can make commuting shorter and more convenient would be a straightforward way to reduce minor but widespread suffering.","People have the problem of denial. This is one of the things I learned in Lebanon. Everybody who left Beirut when the war started, including my parents, said, 'Oh, its temporary.' It lasted 17 years! People tend to underestimate the gravity of these situations. That's how they work.","Most people are sceptical about the wrong things and gullible about the wrong things.","I don't know anyone on Wall Street who goes to work every day thinking of anything but how to increase their bonus.","I've been telling anyone willing to listen that banks have a tendency to sit on time bombs while convincing themselves that they are conservative and nonvolatile.","If I ask you to write down the last 4 digits of your social security number, and then take you out to lunch and ask you how many dentists there are in Manhattan, there's going to be a high correlation between those two numbers. What happens is that the number psychologically makes you feel confident.","A good maxim allows you to have the last word without even starting a conversation.","Globalization has created this interlocking fragility. At no time in the history of the universe has the cancellation of a Christmas order in New York meant layoffs in China.","When you ask people, 'What's the opposite of fragile?,' they tend to say robust, resilient, adaptable, solid, strong. That's not it. The opposite of fragile is something that gains from disorder.","What America does best is produce the ability to accept failure.","The Internet allows the small guy a global marketplace. But technology is harmful in the sense that we get too much information from it. Because of the web we get 10 times the amount of noise we ever got, which makes harmful fallacies far more likely.","In the United States, large corporations control some members of Congress. All this does is delay the corporation's funeral at our expense.","Capitalism is about adventurers who get harmed by their mistakes, not people who harm others with their mistakes.","I drive a hybrid, moving into an electric car. I only drink tap water, never consume food that's travelled.","We should ban banks from risk-taking because society is going to pay the price.","You know, children philosophize more than adults - and they are critical of adults.","Nature builds things that are antifragile. In the case of evolution, nature uses disorder to grow stronger. Occasional starvation or going to the gym also makes you stronger, because you subject your body to stressors and gain from them.","Bailing out every bank that fails makes the system riskier, not safer.","A country's assets reside in the tinkerers, the hobbyists, and the risk-takers.","Individuals should think about the worst-case scenarios and plan for them. The world will be crazier than you think it will be. Put money away, and then you can live with much more freedom.","The track record of economists in predicting events is monstrously bad. It is beyond simplification; it is like medieval medicine.","People employed in financial institutions are rarely interesting and even more rarely likable.","The best philosophers were not academics, but had another job, so their philosophy was not corrupted by careerism.","Poverty is clearly one source of emotional suffering, but there are others, like loneliness.","Nobody reads the disclosures that roll down your computer screen. You click 'I agree' but you don't know what you're agreeing to.","When I trade, I don't have an agency problem; I have my neck on the line. When a bank or banker trades, it's not his neck on the line.","I hated school because I liked to daydream and the system tried to stop me from that.","We humans lack imagination, to the point of not even knowing what tomorrow's important things will look like.","I don't go to the doctor except when I'm very ill, and when I go to India, I drink a drop of local water.","Success is about honour, feeling morally calibrated, absence of shame, not what some newspaper defines from an external metric.","I am happy everywhere except in places where I see glitz and rich farts. I am happiest in Brooklyn, where the concentration of rich farts is minimal.","I don't read the papers; I stopped reading the papers. I read the papers only during periods of crisis, and I think papers are too long on a regular day and too short days when we have a crisis.","Alan Greenspan is unskilled; you don't take the unskilled seriously.","Being an economist is the least ethical profession, closer to charlatanism than any science.","I'm in favour of religion as a tamer of arrogance. For a Greek Orthodox, the idea of God as creator outside the human is not God in God's terms. My God isn't the God of George Bush.","The key to wealth is that it doesn't matter. Once you've had it, you don't think anything of it; you can wear cheap watches.","Writing is sacred, other activities are profane, and I don't want them to corrupt my writing.","We are victims of the post-Enlightenment view that the world functions like a sophisticated machine, to be understood like a textbook engineering problem and run by wonks. In other words, like a home appliance, not like the human body.","In social policy, when we provide a safety net, it should be designed to help people take more entrepreneurial risks, not to turn them into dependents. This doesn't mean that we should be callous to the underprivileged.","The American people will eventually get hurt by this accumulated deficit. That's the problem. We have too much deficit. We have to find a solution.","Most so-called writers keep writing and writing with the hope, some day, to find something to say.","I no longer care about the financial system. I gave them my roadmap. OK? Thanks, bye. I've no idea what's going on. I'm disconnected. I'm totally disengaged.","I'm a private intellectual, not a public one.","Paul Krugman is a danger to society!","If you are an Arabic-speaking, Greek-Orthodox going to a French school it makes you deeply sceptical if you have to listen to three different accounts of the Crusades - one from the Muslim side, one from the Greek side and one from the Catholic side.","The people I go after are the false experts, those who do not accept the limits of their knowledge.","I select a very small number of things to be sceptical about, such as markets, and on these I am hypersceptic. But I want to be fooled by randomness in art. I want the ceremonial of religion; we are made for it.","Corporations take the humanity out of trade - they take the happiness out and replace it with something that is ugly.","You have family-owned businesses that have been around for 500 years. You cannot name a corporation that survives intact for even a few decades.","Debt is a mistake between lender and borrower, and both should suffer.","The grandchildren should not bear the debts of the grandparents.","I have never had personal debt and never will.","The world we live in is vastly different from the world we think we live in.","It might be useful to be able to predict war. But tension does not necessarily lead to war, but often to peace and to denouement.","I'm a capitalist but one who is smallist and localist, and who favours businesses where owners are still in charge.","Inequalities of wealth lead to a dispersion in wealth for all.","You are rich if and only if money you refuse tastes better than money you accept.","The mortgage crisis is a clear instance of consumers who needed protection. There was predatory lending to people who didn't know what they were doing.","Governments that try to shoot for a surplus hardly ever reach it.","What we need to do is break the financial community's grip on society.","Deficits are like putting dynamite in the hands of children. They can get out of control very quickly.","Democracies can't handle austerity measures very well.","Economics make homeopath and alternative healers look empirical and scientific."],"Nastassja Kinski":["Water for me is so essential, like swimming.","I live for being with the people I love and to live as happily as possible.","I love oldies just kind of sweet, slinky, Fifties music. The slow stuff. And Billie Holiday.","Having children is what a woman is born for, really.","Water is always a support or a healing thing apart from, you know, love or peace of mind.","It's pleasant and bothersome and embarrassing all at once. Especially when you haven't done much and are a celebrity.","I have these visions of myself being thirty, thirty-five, forty having a family.","Not that I want everything right now; but I do want everything.","But when it really happens I'm very fascinated, I'm waiting for the moment, because the moment where life abandons you and death steps in, that moment must be fantastic, no?","I wish I played an instrument, but I could never decide which one, and I ended up playing nothing.","I love men who make me laugh.","I wish I had had a great disappointment, a real one.","The years go so fast. I mean, I just realized that at the end of the year I will be twenty-two, and I just turned twenty-one.","I want to feel good, I want to feel proud, I want to feel that I give someone enough and that I get enough.","To be successful for a moment because of one movie doesn't mean anything.","It's so great to love somebody and, out of that, to make a child. So that's my goal.","My parents found what I was interested in and encouraged me. They didn't put me in front of a television and buy lots of toys, the way some American parents do.","You can learn so much from children, and you can give them so much.","It should be only a part of my life, but it isn't. I have only one thing: my work.","You play a part, and as soon as a movie is over and the camera stops, you go home and you're not really responsible for what you've done.","Actors, after all, dream.","It's true what people say - that actors are the closest thing there is to children. They play.","I want to do movies but not talk about them.","I'd also like to do a play. I've never done theater, and constantly changing and refining a performance is something I'd like to do, even though it may sound like work to some people - and it probably is work.","I used to dance when I was younger - ballet and modern dance.","And you must dare to do as many things as you dream of.","Even though things happen by accident, you also unconsciously choose things that help you.","I always have the feeling in these low states that something good is about to happen. That's when I feel the fullest, the rawest, the closest to myself."],"Nastia Liukin":["Gymnastics, especially in my family, is more than a sport. It's our life, it's our careers, it's our family business.","I knew that life isn't always just about the Olympic gold medals and the sponsors.","I don't want to repeat my mistakes.","The first time I walked into the Olympic athlete village seeing the Visa ATM machine with my picture on it and the Chinese characters saying 'Destiny.' For some reason, it just boosted my confidence and it was before I had even worked out or had my first training or competed.","You ask any person in the U.S. and they know who Mary Lou Retton is.","I also want to get out there in the world and do some acting and fashion and modeling.","I've missed being able to flip in the air, flip on the beam and swing on the bars.","I'm showing the younger generation your career doesn't have to be over when you're 16-years-old.","Supergirl is such an iconic brand, and for me to be able to be the new face of it is extremely exciting.","I brought a lot of my own pieces of clothes to the design room when I first met with the design team just so they could see what my style was like.","Like at home, I don't wear heels. But everywhere else I go, I wear heels.","I'm just trying to really take it one day at a time, because for me - and I know this sounds cliche, whatever - I achieved my ultimate goal, and nothing can really top that, you know?","I take it a little bit hard on myself because I'm comparing myself a lot, and that's the kind of person I am because I'm so competitive, but it's also good, because I am competitive, so it kind of kicks you in the butt."],"Nat Faxon":["I would love an upgrade from the Nielsen box; it feels so antiquated to me.","Making a movie is still very difficult in Hollywood, regardless of what you have and what level you're at. It is a house of cards, and things have to perfectly align.","There's something about the schedule of working in TV that's attractive. You know exactly what the next six months is going to be like: You'll work Monday through Friday and have the weekends off, and then there's going to be a hiatus here, so you can kind of plan a little bit.","The benefit of film is that you're shooting something for an intense period of time - and then it's over, and you move on to something else. In TV, you're doing the same thing over and over.","I grew up outside of Boston in a town called Manchester by the Sea, and we spent our summers in Nantucket."],"Nat Friedman":["There are a lot of people who've been able to ditch their Windows machines and switch over to Linux because they can now use their Exchange server for calendaring and collaboration from their Linux desktop.","We plan to support Exchange 2003 as soon as it is released. We already have the prerelease versions from MSDN.","It's probably fair to say that the ratio of time our Connector developers spend in the debugger versus the Emacs buffer is higher than with most software.","A lot of that momentum comes from the fact that Linux is free.","Red Carpet has a nice package abstraction layer that allows us to support RPMs and DEBs transparently.","OS X is sweet: it's simple and intuitive, and I think GNOME shares a lot of values with it.","We're not going to make Evolution or any of our other products depend on Mono anytime in the near future.","Big Linux deployments have reached the point where it's become a real problem for administrators that they don't have nice tools to manage their servers and desktops.","Red Carpet Enterprise has been really well received since one guy can install it in about an hour, and it makes it trivial to deal with software management issues like deploying updates and creating standard package sets for your various machines.","This is what people need: an easy-to-deploy, easy-to-use tool."],"Nat King Cole":["The only sport I'm not interested in is horse racing. That's because I don't know the horses personally.","It's not the people in the South who create racial problems - it's the people who are governing.","People don't slip. Time catches up with them.","I'm an interpreter of stories. When I perform it's like sitting down at my piano and telling fairy stories.","I'm in the music business for one purpose - to make money.","Music is emotional, and you may catch a musician in a very unemotional mood or you may not be in the same frame of mind as the musician. So a critic will often say a musician is slipping.","I'm a musician at heart, I know I'm not really a singer. I couldn't compete with real singers. But I sing because the public buys it.","I may be helping to bring harmony between people through my music.","Get me well so I can get on television and tell people to stop smoking.","For years the Trio did nothing but play for musicians and other hip people. We practically starved to death.","The sheriff is at the cash register, and if I don't get a hit soon, I don't know what I'll do.","Primarily I'm a meat man, although once in a while I toy with a few vegetables.","The only prejudice I've found anywhere in TV is in some advertising agencies, and there isn't so much prejudice as just fear.","I'm not playing for other musicians. We're trying to reach the guy who works all day and wants to spend a buck at night. We'll keep him happy.","The whites come to applaud a Negro performer just like the colored do. When you've got the respect of white and colored, you can ease a lot of things.","There's just one thing I can't figure out. My income tax!","I am famous because I am an African American jazz artist.","I am an American citizen and feel I am entitled to the same rights as any other citizen.","The people who know nothing about music are the ones always talking about it.","The Supreme Court is having a hard time integrating schools. What chance do I have to integrate audiences?","I can't bear to see myself even in movies. The feeling is complex. I can't stand the sight of myself.","If I could read it, I could play it.","Only time, education and plenty of good schooling will make anti-segregation work.","You've got to change with the public's taste.","Critics don't buy records. They get 'em free.","I make no claim to being a business genius. You can make so much money in this business that it loses its value.","I often wonder whether Negroes like myself who are pretty well known help out at all in breaking down barriers.","I was a guinea pig for some hoodlums who thought they could hurt me and frighten me and keep other Negro entertainers from the South.","I'm proud of our court. It knocks back a lot of the propaganda the Communists put out about the way America treats her Negroes."],"Nat Turner":["I had a vision - and I saw white spirits and black spirits engaged in battle, and the sun was darkened - the thunder rolled in the Heavens, and blood flowed in streams - and I heard a voice saying, 'Such is your luck, such are you called to see, and let it come rough or smooth, you must surely bear it.'","Having soon discovered to be great, I must appear so, and therefore studiously avoided mixing in society, and wrapped myself in mystery, devoting my time to fasting and prayer.","All my time not devoted to my master's service was spent either in prayer, or in making experiments in casting different things in moulds made of earth, in attempting to make paper, gunpowder, and many other experiments, that, although I could not perfect, yet convinced me of its practicability if I had the means.","I was not addicted to stealing in my youth, nor have ever been; yet such was the confidence of the Negroes in the neighborhood, even at this early period of my life, in my superior judgment, that they would often carry me with them when they were going on any roguery, to plan for them.","To a mind like mine, restless, inquisitive, and observant of everything that was passing, it is easy to suppose that religion was the subject to which it would be directed; and, although this subject principally occupied my thoughts, there was nothing that I saw or heard of to which my attention was not directed.","Since the commencement of 1830, I had been living with Mr. Joseph Travis, who was to me a kind master and placed the greatest confidence in me; in fact, I had no cause to complain of his treatment of me.","When I got large enough to go to work, while employed I was reflecting on many things that would present themselves to my imagination; and whenever an opportunity occurred of looking at a book, when the school-children were getting their lessons, I would find many things that the fertility of my own imagination had depicted to me before.","After having supplied myself with provisions from Mr. Travis's, I scratched a hole under a pile of fence rails in a field, where I concealed myself for six weeks, never leaving my hiding place but for a few minutes in the dead of night to get water, which was very near."],"Nat Wolff":["Jazz is smooth and cool. Jazz is rage. Jazz flows like water. Jazz never seems to begin or end. Jazz isn't methodical, but jazz isn't messy either. Jazz is a conversation, a give and take. Jazz is the connection and communication between musicians. Jazz is abandon.","I have learned a lot from jazz. I compare good acting to jazz music. The more you study and prepare as an actor, the more equipped you are to live in the moment. Just like the gifted musicians in my dad's quartet, it takes a courageous actor to be free.","I think as long as I have a creative outlet, I'm happy.","I love James Taylor, Jeff Buckley, Elliott Smith and Nine Inch Nails.","I can play a bunch of instruments but drums? My brother's a drummer and I've always been jealous that he's such a good drummer. I always try to play but it's always kinda just bashing. I can keep time but no one really wants to hear me play drums.","'Holes' was my favorite book ever. So you know when you love a book and you hear it's being made into a movie and it makes you a little annoyed at first? But I would've loved to play the Shia LaBeouf role in that movie when I was younger. I just wanted to be the rebellious kid on the old digging camp.","Paul Rudd is too perfect. He's super talented, super nice and super calm. I just think he's a robot.","I feel like all the parts are seniors in high school and seventh graders, and I think I kinda skipped that awkward stage by not working those years.","I've been kind of lucky. I've always just kind of followed whatever my passion was, and that seems to have led me to better places than if I had followed some career trajectory, which I wouldn't even know how to start.","If I'm not doing anything, I get really antsy and bored.","When romance is done well in a movie, it's awesome.","I have very weirdly realistic dreams where it could be real life, except it's not.","I'm a huge Nirvana fan.","It's jarring to go from one amazing experience to another that feels ordinary. I don't quite know how to explain it. You see the uniqueness of what you've been doing, and disassociating yourself from it and going back to the 'normal' life is tough.","Jazz is a constant theme in my life. My father is a jazz pianist, and from an early age I have been surrounded by it.","I would not describe myself as an avid jazz fan and I am not a jazz musician myself. However, that is not to say that jazz does not play a vital and important role in my life.","Every single movie I go up for I'm just checking the phone to see if the e-mail's come in, to see if I got the part yet, which makes me more anxious.","I think Paul Weitz is a really amazing director, obviously with tons of acclaim and stuff, but I still think he is underrated. And I think he's amazing to work with, so I was super lucky.","I had parents in the business and they made sure that the art was the biggest concern.","It's just become such a business, getting into college. I see that a lot in my friends, their parents were so on top of them about getting into an Ivy League school since they were so young, they were just drilled and drilled and drilled, to the point that they just don't know why they want to go.","There's no master plan; I'm just going with what I'm inspired to do and what I get asked to do, and luckily the things I've been the most passionate about, I've gotten to do. And a lot of times I've gone up for movies that I didn't really care that much about, and I never got that.","I've been playing my instrument since I was about three or four. That's when I started banging around on the piano, trying to be like The Beatles.","I think music is my favorite thing to do, but I go through periods where I think differently.","Now, everybody knows my music. So that's really cool. A lot of kids know it. Now, when I go to a sports game, everybody knows my name.","Paul McCartney and The Beatles in general are my idols. And I love Sting. I got to meet Sting. That was really cool. Dustin Hoffman is my favorite actor. Also, I think of Magic Johnson as an idol."],"Natalia Dyer":["People do recognize me. I walk around with sunglasses, and I think I'm hidden, but they see me.","Social media - It's not real life. I only caught the tail end of it in high school. It can be good, and it can be fun, but you can't let it get toxic.","The hardest thing is not caring about other people's opinions.","When people approach me, it's a vulnerable moment for everybody. You can see that sometimes people don't quite know what to say to you, but they want to come up to you, and you can tell they're nervous, and it's really humbling and endearing.","I think people are going to places that they weren't able to with television before, and I think Netflix really paved the way for that. With freedom comes better content, and with better content comes great actors and a bigger audience. I think that has just snowballed into a movement for making really great TV.","I'm not a momentary decision maker. I like well-informed decisions.","Sometimes I wake up and look in the mirror and am like, 'Whoa!' I don't know if I'm having more fun, but I'm having a lot of fun.","My mom loves the '80s. I grew up hearing a lot about the '80s.","Good luck dragging me into a horror movie! I get so scared. It's an overactive imagination or something.","I do see a lot of roles that are, like, the girlfriend or the love interest or the girl next door. Maybe not totally well-rounded kinds of characters - women who are more of a plot device in a way.","There's a lot to love about Nancy Wheeler in the second season of 'Stranger Things.'","I had never seen the classics with Molly Ringwald, like 'Pretty in Pink' or 'Sixteen Candles,' or '80s horror, like 'Poltergeist,' 'Close Encounters,' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street.' I went back and watched all of those.","I'm really drawn to relationship stories and human emotions.","When you go to set, they just go, 'OK, let's see what you guys do!' The camera moves around what you initially feel.","To go from not being recognised at all to literally, the next day, having people stop you in the street was very, very weird. I had to buy myself a great baseball cap.","I do have Instagram, but I try to avoid going on it too much. Some people are very good at how they use it, and they enjoy that interaction, but I want to be very careful.","I don't really like scary movies. I don't seek them out. I'm very sensitive and impressionable. I'm the kind of person who will sleep with the light on for a week if I get really scared.","I was always kind of searching for the right social group in high school and never really felt like I belonged with any one specific clique.","When you're in high school, and you're trying to get the attention of a guy you like, sometimes you don't always make the best decisions."],"Natalia Ginzburg":["No adultery is bloodless.","You aren't ill: it is just that you are made of second-rate materials.","Today, as never before, the fates of men are so intimately linked to one another that a disaster for one is a disaster for everybody.","When I write stories I am like someone who is in her own country, walking along streets that she has known since she was a child, between walls and trees that are hers."],"Natalia Kills":["When I was a kid, my mother used to film all of our holidays and all of the good times, and I kind of associated the camera with everything being okay and everything being happy.","I really can't break away from wearing black and leather!","A lot of the time we think finances are immediately linked to experience, opportunities, image, and all sorts of important things that can progress us in life. Sometimes they're not. Finances can be completely irrelevant if you allow yourself to feel like things are going well.","I always put on a brave face when I was the most terrified, the most trapped and out of control.","The entire value of a person is subjective to your relationship with them.","All the best parts of art come from pain turned to celebration.","Every bad thing that's happened to me has defined me, has shaped, has moulded me.","I'm sick of running away from things.","I don't really know what 'a dark place' means. I have windows in my house, and I'm generally an upbeat person! A lot of people throw that word at me because I wear a lot of black and leather.","I had been writing songs for other people for a while, and I made a demo and I put it on my Myspace, which Perez Hilton found and blogged about on his site.","Nothing is more important than when you see someone for the first time, and you get that feeling where you can't move or speak or do anything until you know that person and take a sense of who they are with you.","I was born in Bradford, a city in the north of England that God forgot about. A place where most people never leave, but if they do, they certainly never go back.","It's good to actually cry. Trust me, I've had a lot of practice over the years!","I love Audrey Hepburn, early Brooke Shields, and Madonna's eyebrows. I think it's beautiful if women look soft and touchable instead of hard, sharp and aggressively groomed.","I feel like trouble has followed me from the day I was born.","I realized that, all along, my theory was right: Make music that you want to hear, and instead of having fans that one day might criticize or abandon you, your fans aren't even fans. They're people with tastes similar to yours. They're friends you haven't met yet.","Artists are definitely, like, under a sort of microscope of scrutiny more than others.","I didn't really like being on television at all.","My dad went to jail for a long time. We lost everything, and the situation never resolved itself. My parents had this sort of passionate, disastrous desire for each other - not ideal to grow up in.","I feel like all Londoners relate more to New York - L.A. doesn't feel like a 'city' city. It's like a sleepy town.","I will never censor myself to please anyone.","Guess what, I'm the opposite of a role model!","I definitely like performing to a crowd that's there to see a female hero.","I definitely feel excited to be able to put really hard beats - like hip-hop beats - behind my music, more than I did before.","I like a dramatic eye and a bold lip.","My grandma told me never, ever, ever to use soap on my face. But I do use lotion.","The worst mistake a woman can make is to emulate a man.","If people go into music with the idea of competing with other artists, then they're doing it for all the wrong reasons.","I don't listen to music, actually. Obviously I go to clubs; I stand in elevators; a lot of my friends are musicians; I hear music all the time. But I don't have my own collection of music.","When I was in my early teens, I joined a cult. And we weren't allowed to listen to secular music or anything that wasn't made by us. So I spent a lot of time not listening to music, and by the time I could, I just didn't get into it.","I make music because I like making music.","My song-writing has always been just about my life - usually my worst moments.","I make the music my ears want to hear, I wear the clothes my body wants to wear and the ones boys call me back for, and I generally make the songs that my feet dance to.","If you allow yourself to feel fabulous, you are fabulous."],"Natalia Makarova":["Technical things are getting more mechanical. Take 'Swan Lake,' the Black Swan pas de deux. Now, my goodness, they're turning not just 32 fouettes - but double or triple pirouettes.","It's not possible to be perfect - you can always do something better. I'm never proud of what I've done. Sometimes, I'm not ashamed.","All ballet, all reading, all music. That was my world, my inner world.","It's a hard life... but if I could, I would do it all again.","To look back all the time is boring. Excitement lies in tomorrow.","Even the ears must dance.","Dancers, many dancers today can do so much technically. You can give them steps that are complicated, then more complicated, pyrotechnical - and they can execute these steps to perfection. But to do simple steps with a pure classical line, that is truly difficult.","I travel like a gypsy, and I didn't know how I could perform and be a mother.","People tell me I'm dancing better than ever. I don't know what happened, but I have new enthusiasm and more endurance.","I don't keep my secrets or my knowledge to myself.","You cannot dance an arabesque in 'Swan Lake' and 'Nutcracker' the same way.","I recently learn a new word: insatiable. That's me.","I think often that God is guiding me.","All of the very important events in my life happen by chance.","I really feel sorry for new generation. It's hard to find backbone. I never had crisis of identity. But I think many Americans have it.","Many people thought I would never succeed, because I am so Russian. So Russian, hundred percent.","I am different because I have better schooling, better understanding of the line, gesture, how feet working, positions. They taught me modern things... and I wanted to give what I had: my schooling.","I want to be free... free to develop my art.","Because my profession is the body, it is a relaxation for me to get out of physicality and concentrate on more mental things.","Usually, English personalities are difficult; they don't take criticism easily."],"Natalia Tena":["I love the fact that little kids think I'm a witch. A mum might come over and say 'I'm sorry to disturb you, but my daughter thinks you're in 'Harry Potter.' I'll say 'That's cool' and take the kid aside and say, 'I'm a witch. If you don't listen to your mum, I'm going to haunt you!' It's brilliant. I can scare kids into doing their homework.","I'm a very impatient person. I love dancing, I love music, and I love eating life.","I love doing short films because they're much more intimate and there's far less waiting around than on the bigger films.","I've had watermelon hair where I had pink with green tips. From the age of 13 to about 19 or 20, I never had my real hair color.","I have three things I really, really want to do. I want to do aerial trapeze, I want to do martial arts, and I want to learn Russian. And, because of my life, I'm not able to do any of these.","I've always loved projects where I can combine acting and music.","If I just did music, I might go insane. I need words; I need stories. And it's the same the other way around.","I recently went to New York for the first time, and honey, I'm in love with that place. I'm obsessed with its sausages.","For ages, I had this mullet until someone on the street stopped me and said, 'Darling, can I cut your hair for free? Because you look a bit weird.'","Whenever I start a 'Potter' film, I get these dreams. The last dream I had, I was in a war and the sky was blotted with broomsticks and I couldn't find my wand. It was so intense. I always have mental, intense, war wizard dreams when I'm doing the films.","Like a lot of people, I love a bit of blood and gore.","My love of music comes from as long as I remember. I begged my mum to learn piano for a year when I was 4; she wanted to make sure I was serious, and I wanted to be Chuck Berry when I grew up! We were a very musical family; my mum would play guitar, and her, my dad and aunt would sing and harmonize!","I need both music and acting to even think about surviving life. I don't have a choice."],"Natalia Vodianova":["Because of my childhood where I was constantly by myself, I always feel lonely. I have a lot of people that I absolutely love and I know love me but I can't get rid of that feeling of loneliness no matter who I'm with - even with my children.","Moscow is a huge inspiration for me. I love what I find here, I love being here.","I learnt early to have little expectation so I protected myself from ever feeling greatly disappointed.","If you never know hardship, you can't really support people around you.","My childhood gave me resilience - and there's little that can surprise me in life.","Before I left Russia in 1999, I was living in a very poor factory town with my family and friends, and nothing was ever going to change.","I have made enough money to secure my family and that is all I care about.","We all have our own purpose in life and I feel very strongly that I have a bigger purpose than giving to just my immediate family and friends.","I believe in reincarnation of the soul.","When you are at the bottom, you find beauty in such little things, and goodness in such little gestures. When I compare any struggle today to ones that I may have had in my childhood, there is nothing that can bring me down.","My appearance gave me access to a particular kind of world and I'm really grateful for it.","I raised my sister. I was six when she was born. My mother had to make a living for herself and it was very hard, so I was looking after my sister, cooking and cleaning, and she had four jobs.","When you become a mother, you think less about yourself and care more about the world.","Finding out I was pretty was a very nice realisation.","As a child I really didn't like men at all, in fact.","I love Yves Saint Laurent and Giambattista Valli and Givenchy, and I get given quite a lot, but perhaps nothing is as wonderful as the white fake leather trench coat I got when I was 15.","I live a very different life now, with incredible privileges, but looking back I realise that growing up in Russia gave me tools that other people don't necessarily have - such as the will to push that bit further, to make things happen, to succeed.","I know what it's like not to have food in the fridge or money to buy more.","I completely admire my mother for raising a child with cerebral palsy at home.","I missed quite a lot of school because I was working from the age of 11.","If you are ambitious you can have a moment of glory but it will most likely be temporary. But talent always finds its way out.","I was born in Nizhny Novgorod to a very poor family and unfortunately my father and mother separated when I was very little.","I think protecting your family and giving to them is so important. It's the most important achievement.","I don't mind being called 'Supernova.' If one nickname is going to stick, that's not a bad one!","It's better to be skinny than to be fat.","The people that live in my hometown do not walk along the street with smiles on their faces. It is a desperate place, but I got out.","When I remember my life in Russia it is in totally dark colours."],"Natalie Babbitt":["We human beings do a lot of dumb things, and war is certainly the dumbest.","Right after graduation, I married Samuel Fisher Babbitt, an academic administrator. I spent the next ten years in Connecticut, Tennessee, and Washington, D.C., raising our children, Christopher, Tom, and Lucy.","I have always loved astronomy, and being an astronomer once lurked in the back of my mind. But I was never good at algebra. In fact, I flunked it twice in high school.","I never wanted to be a writer. I wanted to be a book illustrator. I used to hurry home from school and draw.","My husband wrote the story for my first book, but then he didn't want to do that anymore. So if I was going to go on being an illustrator, I had to start writing the stories, too.","The first two books that I did by myself were long stories in verse. I knew I could do that because I'd written a lot in verse. But, verse stories are hard to sell, so my editor encouraged me to try writing in prose.","I had a wonderful mother who wanted my sister and me to have everything, even though money was a very prominent thing we didn't have. But we had a very happy childhood - pretty much ideal, in fact.","I have a wonderful husband, and we have had a great life.","My mother was an artist, and I was fairly good at art as a child. I was always the best drawer in class, except in second grade when an artistic genius passed through our school!","I was born and raised in Ohio. During my childhood, I spent most of my time drawing and reading fairy tales and myths.","I grew up wanting only to be an illustrator. I studied art at Laurel School in Cleveland and at Smith College.","I write for children because I am interested in fantasy and the possibilities for experience of all kinds before the time of compromise. I believe that children are far more perceptive and wise than American books give them credit for being."],"Natalie Clifford Barney":["The advantage of love at first sight is that it delays a second sight.","Why grab possessions like thieves, or divide them like socialists when you can ignore them like wise men?","Fatalism is the lazy man's way of accepting the inevitable.","When you're in love you never really know whether your elation comes from the qualities of the one you love, or if it attributes them to her; whether the light which surrounds her like a halo comes from you, from her, or from the meeting of your sparks.","If we keep an open mind, too much is likely to fall into it.","Youth is not a question of years: one is young or old from birth.","There are intangible realities which float near us, formless and without words; realities which no one has thought out, and which are excluded for lack of interpreters.","Time engraves our faces with all the tears we have not shed.","Entrepreneurship is the last refuge of the trouble making individual.","To be one's own master is to be the slave of self.","Would that well-thinking people should be replaced by thinking ones.","How many inner resources one needs to tolerate a life of leisure without fatigue.","Novels are longer than life.","Most virtue is a demand for greater seduction.","It is time for dead languages to be quiet.","Lovers should also have their days off.","Renouncement: the heroism of mediocrity."],"Natalie Cole":["I think people hear the warmth in my voice and the friendliness, and they think: 'Oh, she must be a very nice person'.","I love what I do so much. I just keep going. Not much can bring me down.","I have been to hell and back. I have seen the edge. I have seen the dark side of life.","God surrounded me with people of faith, people of strong faith, people of power, spiritual power, and I saw little miracles happen in their lives. By it happening in their lives, I started believing it could happen to me.","When I did 'Unforgettable,' it wasn't appropriate for us to take liberties with that music. There had to be kind of a fine line between what had made it so great and the fact that a woman was singing it. We changed some of the arrangements, but not too much.","Life is such a gift, I just say thank you all day.","I think that I am a walking testimony to you can have scars. You can go through turbulent times and still have victory in your life.","I've always been an extremist. Some of us have very addictive personalities, and for some of us, that mechanism gets tripped up. Mine certainly did. I'm not cured. You never are. The recovery is a day-to-day process.","If you don't shop smart, you get a little trendy.","I'm an ordinary person under extraordinary circumstances.","I never got to make that transition from little girl to young woman... and that really screws you up.","Las Vegas has the type of audience - and they haven't changed since my father's days - they're still boring and bored. And there's only that handful of artists that they really enjoy and know how to respond to.","My father led by example. He wasn't much of a talker - he walked life.","The medication I had to take was a form of chemotherapy. You feel like death every day. No appetite. No energy. But the treatment worked. It cured my liver 80 per cent but compromised my kidneys.","Physically, I've seen a change in my life. No, I haven't had a face lift or anything like that. I've grown. That's God's countenance.","There were so many groups that I had in college, but I was always the solo singer. But what made it so unusual back in the day was that I was a black girl playing with all these white musicians, and I was also singing rock music on top of it.","It's remarkable what a new kidney does to your life. I have no complaints... I'm pretty amazed. I have been working on my stamina.","I'm the type of person who won't cancel a show even if I don't feel my best.","I think foreign countries really do like it when American artists sing in their language. And when you go over there and say, 'Hi, how are you?' in their language, they love it. It makes them feel like you're doing it just for them. We in America take so much for granted.","I've had my share of doing things that I really wish I hadn't done.","My idols are Janis Joplin and Annie Lennox, who are neither of them from the typical pop culture.","I don't think that my parents even imagined that I would be exposed to drugs. In those days, for some reason, it was not talked about, just like sex was not talked about.","When you have put all your faith in man and continue to be disappointed, don't you hope there is something out of there that is not of human element?","There's inevitably something missing when you grow up in this kind of an environment when your parents travel a lot. When your father is famous, you are looked at and expected of. There are standards you need to meet.","We had some wonderful people raising us, but they still weren't our parents. As you get older, it gets distorted and convoluted, complicated, and, of course, you start looking for attention, affection, affinity in all the wrong places and in all the wrong ways.","God was going to be to me the father that I never had, the father that I didn't have enough of, enough time with.","I managed to survive the worst things any entertainer could possibly go through.","I imagine there are a lot of people who will never be able to accept me because they feel I've let them down, but I am a different person, and most people have welcomed me back in that spirit.","I think that I sound a lot better than Diana Ross.","Aretha Franklin does not like me.","I've always been interested in the office. I was a secretary a long time ago, and I've always been into paperwork. My first secretarial job was 1965 or 1966.","I was pretty young, but because of that first record, 'Cole Espanol,' we took our first trip - well, my first trip - to Mexico.","The house where I grew up in the Hancock Park section of Los Angeles was like a dream - even though my family faced threats after my father bought it in August 1948.","As kids, we had no clue about the racial stuff that seemed to preoccupy adults. We just enjoyed our life as kids.","When I was old enough to walk home alone from school, I loved seeing our house from a distance. It sat on the corner of South Muirfield Road and West 4th Street and had this proud, majestic look. But I rarely went through the front door. The back was more dramatic.","I loved when my dad was home. He liked to sit in the living room and watch boxing and baseball on TV. Or he'd be tinkering around or listening to records by his musician buddies - George Shearing, Oscar Peterson and the Jackie Gleason Orchestra.","I had to make peace with my past because I can't change it.","It's important to wallow and grieve when you have a health issue. I don't think you really get the best stuff out of life until you've had the worst stuff.","You shouldn't have regrets. I'd say instead that I've learned a lot of lessons. Yes, I could have handled some things better. But they've also made me who I am today.","I've always loved Spanish. I love my father's Spanish records.","I think people just want to be popular. So they're going to write lyrics that are going to get your attention. You know, sometimes, they're a little graphic, and I don't think that's so necessary.","I think we need to be sexy and kind of mysterious and still pretty and beautiful. I like to hear that when a man sings. I don't really want to hear about taking my clothes off.","My first trip to Mexico was with my dad because of his Spanish records. That was back in 1958. I found a picture of me when I was eight dressed as a little senorita.","People said when I started, 'Why don't you just copy your father's style?' I had to be myself, singing my songs in my own way.","Nothing had been attempted like that, to lift Dad's voice, literally, off of that track and put it on a brand-new one, and then line it up, match it up, get the phrasing right. I remember listening - everyone listening at the end, and we were just enthralled. It was really wonderful.","I couldn't breathe. I - I went into - literally, my kidneys stopped functioning. They stopped, you know, processing the fluid that was starting to build up in my body.","I have been on dialysis in Istanbul, Milan, Indonesia, Manila, London. It's - it's amazing.","There are some great human beings out there. That's all I can say.","I feel enough distance from the person I used to be. I'm not ashamed about my life anymore, because I've learnt from it.","I continually acted up to get attention. My father gave me that, and once he left, I felt that I didn't have any.","I can laugh at myself because I've had to. Everything would have been much worse if I'd been the singing son of Nat 'King' Cole.","If you don't have dialysis, absolutely, you will die. Dialysis is actually keeping me alive.","I was pretty bad. When I first was diagnosed with kidney failure, my function - the function of my kidney was less than 8 percent.","I already had high blood pressure. I have hypertension. And I think the chemo was just too much for my kidneys. And they went into failure. And that was September 12th of 2008. And the doctor rushed me right to the hospital.","We used to have to arrange things around the dialysis. I would have to plan where to play so I could be back in time, and couldn't go too far.","I started saying, 'I don't want to be crazy anymore.' I need to make some changes. And the first thing I started doing was just got all the men out of my life, because that was a big problem for me. That was a crutch, if you will. You know, trying to define yourself through other people or men, in particular.","I think that talented people really do have insecurities, and that is one of the things that kind of motivates them, because that's one thing they know they're good at. And when they're up on that stage, you can do no wrong. The audience is yours; they're there to see you.","The worst I think that I ever was, when 'Unforgettable' had come out, and not long after that I was on - I was on my way to my second divorce. And that was a crushing, crushing blow.","I'm a born-again Christian. I was raised Episcopalian - I've always been of a Christian faith, but I became much more active in it when I married my first husband, Marvin. I changed from Episcopalian to Baptist.","I still love recording and still love the stage, but like my dad, I have the most fun when I am in front of that glorious orchestra or that kick-butt big band.","Losing people is dark, but some things you just have to accept.","When I sang my father's songs in concert, that was all people wanted to hear. I was always asking myself, 'Can I measure up?'","I've always adored my father's music, but ever since I'd started singing, whether it was while I was still a student at the University of Massachusetts or professionally, I avoided Dad's material.","I was madly in love with Elvis Presley. Dad wasn't into it at all, at least not for himself as a performer. He used to say, 'Mr. Cole does not rock n' roll.'","I was determined to create my own identity. My first hits, in fact, were straight-up rhythm and blues. My voice was compared to Aretha Franklin's - though, for my money, no one compares to Aretha.","By the time I approached my forties, I had the self-assurance to approach all the genres I love so deeply: R & B, rock, jazz, and pop.","As miserable as I was, once I started singing, I felt better.","I'd sometimes fly for 14 hours, then go straight to dialysis. I spent a little time being tired, but we managed. I'm not a pity-party person.","I know that God has had my back, even when I was screwing up.","We are born with two kidneys and only need one to survive. Maybe God gave us the other one so that we could give it away.","Like my father, I don't want to see anyone mistreated, anything like that. I'm very racial-conscious because my father had a lot of, you know, challenges in the area of race. I'm very sensitive to that kind of issue.","I was going to college to be a doctor.","One thing that stays the same is my passion for music. Other than that, I've become more dedicated. I think that I really work much harder than I ever did when I first started at my craft; I'm more dedicated, and I have become a perfectionist.","I don't think anyone can measure up to what my father had achieved. I'm just happy to at least play some of his music, but he is really the one who was the pioneer, the one who started all this. He's really The King.","My father was a pioneer in so many ways. He was fearless, and I think that I kind of picked that up from him as well.","I think that it's going to be interesting to see where Beyonce's career goes.","I like Kelly Rowland, I think that she's great. It's hard to come out of the group of Destiny's Child and still kick some butt.","Being my dad's daughter has allowed me to do a lot of things that maybe another artist might not be able to do or wouldn't be necessarily embraced doing."],"Natalie Coughlin":["I actually love swimming but I just hate jumping in the water.","I live in a swimsuit so I'm really comfortable with my body.","I don't have any superstitions, but what I always travel with is my pillow and my coffee.","You see a lot of us lingering around. We'll just stand there on the edge of the pool and kinda psych ourselves up into getting in.","I'm comfortable in the locker room situation, so whatever.","When I was little, I wasn't so little. I had a big old round belly and I was really clumsy, but I was super confident.","I hate how late we have our Olympic Trials, always have.","There's just something about that cold rush that I know I hate and a lot of other swimmers hate.","I generally wake up at 4:30, have breakfast No. 1, then get to the pool by 5 a.m.","I was the official wedding photographer at one of my best friends' weddings. Fortunately she was one of the most easygoing brides ever, so she made it easy for me.","I very much looked up to Janet Evans and Summer Sanders.","The pressure of the Olympic Games is real overwhelming.","There's an adage that a lot of coaches have, that I completely disagree with, is if you make the Olympic team too early you become complacent.","I was tempted my junior year to go out of college and forgo my eligibility. I had broken several world records. I did have a lot of people telling me that I should go pro."],"Natalie Dormer":["Perfect is very boring, and if you happen to have a different look, that's a celebration of human nature, I think. If we were all symmetrical and perfect, life would be very dull.","For me, it's not necessarily interesting to play a strong, fearless woman. It's interesting to play a woman who is terrified and then overcomes that fear. It's about the journey. Courage is not the absence of fear, it's overcoming it.","The most amazing set where I've shot 'Game of Thrones' is definitely Croatia, in Dubrovnik. It's such a stunning country with lots of good watersports there as well. Just a beautiful, beautiful place.","Shaving half my head was a look that meant I could go punkier with my style.","Long skirts are annoying; they get in the way.","Sometimes a woman's looks or sensuality are too readily wrapped up in their power.","So many little girls dream about their wedding day. But with actresses, sometimes it's the inverse, because we get to be the centre of attention, looked up and down, dressed up for premieres all the time. The pull isn't quite as great.","I think women have always been trying to look healthy. The makeup artists just teach you the quick cheats.","Isn't it lovely to know that even the great Sherlock Holmes, the quirky and genius Sherlock Holmes, is vulnerable to love as we all are?","What makes me really happy is a walk in the English countryside. A nice sunset, that British countryside - it means I'm home.","I don't know if I'm a daredevil, exactly, but I do enjoy a good challenge. It's the only way you grow.","When I turn on the news in Paris, the way Syria is covered is different from the way it is covered in Washington, D.C., or London. Even in Western society, where we hold all the values of democracy and freedom of speech, as soon as you point a camera in a particular direction, there is an angle - literally and figuratively.","I love going out of my comfort zone - I live to go out of my comfort zone.","When I wake up on a Sunday morning with a slight hangover, in the gym with no makeup on, that's who Natalie Dormer really is. The girl next door who gets a spot on her forehead occasionally.","I love cycling.","My first time to Rome was when I was backpacking with my best friend around Europe for a month at 18 years old, so I remember that excitement of being away from home properly for the first time.","I've been spoiled rotten with the costumes I've worn.","I was a very physical child... I was a tree-climber; I was a tomboy.","These are moments in your life to be cherished; they don't come around that often. To be flying around in a 'Game of Thrones' jet, to be greeted by massive enthusiasts.","Emilia Clarke has beautiful brunette hair.","As an actor, you spend a lot of your life in hotel rooms.","I couldn't pick just one defining breakthrough role. I like to think that they're all a part of me.","A lot of boys in my poker circle are mathematicians who play on probability. I don't have that kind of brain, so I rely on instinct. But I recently found out that poker and cards in general go way back in my family gene pool.","I'm a bed monster.","Travel is so important in its capacity to expand the mind. It's exciting to start as young as possible - you get to see how other cultures live, challenge your senses, and try different cuisines.","I think the beauty of the writing of 'Game of Thrones' is not that the characters are fearless; it's how they overcome their fear, you know?","It's a writer's or director's role to be cerebral, whereas for an actor it should be a visceral, gut thing. When the action starts, it's best to turn the brain off and let it become an instinctual thing.","I know I'm not a conventional beauty. You can read a lot of painful things on the Internet, which criticise you aesthetically - but as far as I'm concerned, that's not what an actress is.","Famously, Anne Boleyn was not a beauty: she was more about quirkiness and an innate sensuality, and there are a lot of references to her eyes. Which sends out a great message for women, because life is not about the aesthetic all the time.","I'm a quasi-only child. With my brother and sister, I've more of a tendency to be semi-maternal. So, yes, I spent a lot of time talking to myself - I had this big dressing-up box and would just dress up as lots of characters and talk back to myself... Verging on schizophrenia, I suppose, if you analyse it carefully.","Actors have this amazing skill - we bond quite quickly but equally we move on quite quickly. There's nothing particularly cold or capricious about it - we're troubadours and lead a troubadour's lifestyle.","I feel like I've really earnt my stripes - I feel ready to play a lead. I would just love to prove I'm good enough to carry a project.","I'm not clever enough to be in machinations and real politics.","I had a period of unemployment for about nine months after my first big break, and it's the greatest lesson I ever could have learned, never to believe you're home and dry.","I've always been a history lover. I've spent a lot of recreational time walking around historical castles and estates, in Britain and Europe, and so I know what the real thing looks like.","There are a lot of parallels between the historical Henry VIII and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. There's an oscillation and extremity of emotion throughout his repertoire that lends itself beautifully to the nature of Henry VIII, definitely. He will push things to the limit, and yet remain in emotional control.","Anne Boleyn is an intriguing character. She seems to appeal to modern-day women in a very potent way. Because she was such an independently opinionated and spirited young woman, which at the time was unheard of.","I always tell people this: to be a savvy politician or a good head of state and to be charitable are not mutually exclusive things.","I try to stay consciously away from the roles of the girl who throws herself at the leading man, because I've done it a lot and I want to move on. I ticked that box.","I love watching the old movies. I love Katharine Hepburn. I just adore her and everything that she stood for. I find it interesting watching the likes of Gene Tierney and those classic movies of the '40s.","As an actress, I think it's important to look back and realize that we aren't always quite as original as we think we are. There's this grand, textured history for us over the last 100 years of incredible writers, directors, and performers.","I did every job under the sun from bartending to ushering to temping.","I was so excited to work with Ridley Scott. Who wouldn't be?","It's fascinating how much of our sense of attractiveness and feminine identity is bound up in our hair.","Cutting one side of your head for a few months is not a big deal compared with what other people have to deal with in the world. Plus, hair grows back.","I'm a serial monogamist and would never dream of being as predatory as some of the women I've played. I can actually be a bit shy.","I love to drive. My present to myself from 'The Tudors' was a red Mazda MX5 hard-top convertible. I loved that car, and also what she represented - my first success.","I'm a massive yoga head. Lots of yoga and lots of running. I do Bikram yoga. I adore it.","Because of my job, I get a lot of opportunity to grab a few days here and there in many cool cities for press commitments, magazine shoots and premieres - Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, Paris, Stockholm, New York, Berlin. I always try to get to a gallery or museum if there's time.","I have been to Canada several times. It was autumn when I visited Vancouver, and I will always remember the colour of the trees in British Columbia were stunning.","The Gili Islands gave me some of my best scuba diving experiences, including tons of turtles.","The train system in India is chaotic and fun - it's the best way to see the landscape. Being in with all the families and also being the odd animal is a colourful experience you'll never forget.","I'm a 'Blackadder' girl.","My party trick is that I can get ready to go to the party really quickly. I'm actually a woman that can have a shower, dry and style her hair, do her make-up and get dressed in under an hour.","Make-up is all about shading; it's about tactical application.","I'm a feminist in the true sense of the word. It's about equality.","Women are over 50 percent of the population.","What I love about 'Mockingjay, Part 1' is that President Coin or Cressida could have easily been played by a man, and if you look at 'Interstellar,' the Anne Hathaway or Jessica Chastain roles would have been men years ago.","I'm glad that cinema is catching up to what television has known for a while: That three-dimensional, complex women get an audience engaged as much as the men.","I've taken my clothes off enough in my career.","I'm a natural blonde!","We don't have enough young, female antiheroes. We don't accept women as antiheroes the way we do the men.","We live in one of the most complex ages for young, professional women.","I'm not going to comment about potential jobs in the future because that's a rabbit hole to go down and get caught up in, but all I'll say is I'll go where the good scripts are.","I love being part of huge mega blockbusters, and I love being a part of small independent films and small stage.","From my experience of shooting 'Tudors' on the island of Ireland, you cannot predict the weather.","When I was a little girl, my grandfather, who I was very close to, used to grow yellow roses. He had yellow roses growing all the way up his drive.","I think every actor brings something personal to a role, right?","When I see a fan coming over, I can't help but make an assumption about what they want to talk about. A middle-aged American woman will head over, and I think, 'Game of Thrones.' Turns out it's 'The Tudors' or 'Elementary' or 'The Hunger Games.' It's always a surprise.","I've played a lot of elegance and refinement, so to do something really down and dirty is a great attraction.","As a child, I was prancing around in my mother's high heels and a ra-ra skirt, singing 'Material Girl' into my hairbrush.","Madonna is completely down-to-earth. She's an absolute professional.","I meet fascinating people I respect and idolise all the time.","It really bugs me the way people criticise how actors look. We're not models. Models exist.","I get accused of having a haughty smugness. I have a lopsided mouth. I can't help it. I was born with it. It looks as if I am smirking. I have had my publicist tell me, 'Don't do that smile on the red carpet.' I'm, like, 'That's my smile.'","It's funny how being an actor forces you to do things or go places that you wouldn't ordinarily.","Women have a lot of... attitudes enforced in us about our sense of attractiveness being bound up in long, flowing, Hollywood kind of hair.","The beauty of 'The Hunger Games' and also 'Game of Thrones,' in fairness, both projects have really complex, three-dimensional, contradictory, strong women... The writing of female characters is extraordinary and equal to the men.","I've never been far from the river. I'm sort of like a Thames-nymph.","More often than not, I get cast as quite Machiavellian roles - it's something about my face; I'm quite shifty or something!","My yoga mat comes everywhere. Keeps me stretched out after sitting still on all those planes, trains and road journeys.","Network shows shoot so fast, so you kind of have to just go with your instinct.","I was frequently told at drama school that I was thinking too much. And I still have to suppress that part of me because it can sometimes be a hindrance.","There's a real mischievousness about Irishmen, don't you find?","My role as Ewan McGregor's girlfriend in the film 'Incendiary' ended up on the cutting-room floor, but at least I had two brilliant days of acting with Ewan.","I love poker!","You can think what you like of Madonna - about her political choices and her PR - but you have to respect her courage not to let the critics stop her exploring her potential.","We all need some TLC and to pat ourselves on the back from time to time.","I've been insane from a very early age.","When girls bully, it's very subtle, and you can't define it. At least with boys, the bullying is usually explicit, and you can deal with it. It's psychological with girls.","Kids are very cruel to each other.","I want to keep people guessing.","Sci-fi always runs out a little bit ahead of reality, right? Automatic doors in 'Star Trek,' stuff like that. It all happened, didn't it, finally?","Fashion, historically, is how people make statements about themselves or communicate.","Nothing is taken lightly in 'The Hunger Games.'","I love my camera crews on all my jobs. It's the half of the job that the audience never gets to see. They're integral. They're as much a part of making a movie or television show as I am.","Jennifer Lawrence is just the coolest girl.","To be joining 'The Hunger Games' family is such a thrill. It deserves the hype because it's well written, handles really big subject matter, but doesn't talk down to its audience. And then there's the romance element.","'The Hunger Games' has something for everyone.","Being seduced by a man on crutches was an interesting experience.","Obviously, you have quieter years than others - you don't go jumping out of a plane every day.","You'd have to be an idiot to say no to 'Hunger Games.'","When you have that long, flowing hair, you feel different - when you cut it, the framing of your face changes immediately.","Everything that I do to my own hair and makeup I learned from professionals.","I'm quite physical. I'm from one of those dog-walking families where hiking up a mountain is meant to be fun.","The hair department on 'Game of Thrones' is incredible.","Good style - regardless of fads - means the thing that suits your body.","It is impossible for human beings not to view something subjectively.","I'm a London girl, so I grew up on Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood... Dior, Chanel, the usual suspects.","I'm always open to trying out new things.","Dormer by name, Dormer by nature: I love to sleep.","If there's 'game' in the title, I'm there! Ready to play!","I think we all remember Emma Peel from 'The Avengers,' the feminist icon that she was in the late '60s.","As an actress, as you get older, you find yourself in a situation where you play mothers or women who are hoping to be mothers.","There's a part of my heart that forever has Anne Boleyn written on it, who I played in 'The Tudors.'","Privacy is important to me. But it's not just about sticking two fingers up and saying I don't want anyone to know my business. It's an artistic choice. I think that for any actor to convince their audience that they have completely inhabited a character requires a certain level of anonymity.","The world is changing so quickly, and actors now have this huge platform of social media to interact with their audiences, but I choose not to have a social media footprint. I'm old-school like that.","I screen tested for 'The Tudors' in N.Y. That was my first experience of N.Y., being flown here to screen test with Jonathan Rhys Meyers. So I have very, very fond memories of New York - New York helped give me my first big break.","I've been told that N.Y. in the spring is pretty special.","There was a woman in Elizabeth I's court that happened to have the same family name as me.","I'm very lucky to be in projects that have such skilled writing in them.","I would love to go to the Himalayas and cross over into Nepal to do the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway."],"Natalie Goldberg":["Never underestimate people. They do desire the cut of truth.","Whether you're keeping a journal or writing as a meditation, it's the same thing. What's important is you're having a relationship with your mind.","Trust in what you love, continue to do it, and it will take you where you need to go.","Stress is basically a disconnection from the earth, a forgetting of the breath. Stress is an ignorant state. It believes that everything is an emergency. Nothing is that important. Just lie down.","Life is not orderly. No matter how we try to make life so, right in the middle of it we die, lose a leg, fall in love, drop a jar of applesauce.","Women are wonderful, but they get so caught up about their body. We need to unhook from worrying so much. When I don't feel good, I look in the mirror and think I look fat and miserable. But when I feel good and whole, I'm not worried about my body because I'm living in it. It doesn't become an object.","Talk when you talk, walk when you walk, and die when you die.","When you are present, the world is truly alive.","I feel that 'The Great Failure' is really a book written out of great love and a willingness to face all of who a human being is.","There's no such thing as a writer's block. If you're having trouble writing, well, pick up the pen and write. No matter what, keep that hand moving. Writing is really a physical activity.","If you feel bored or uncomfortable as you're writing, ask yourself what's bothering you and write about that. Sometimes your creative energy is like water in a kinked hose, and before thoughts can flow on the topic at hand, you have to straighten the hose by attending to whatever is preoccupying you.","The correctness and quality of what you write do not matter; the act of writing does.","Sometimes when you think you are done, it is just the edge of beginning. Probably that's why we decide we're done. It's getting too scary. We are touching down onto something real. It is beyond the point when you think you are done that often something strong comes out.","That's very nice if they want to publish you, but don't pay too much attention to it. It will toss you away. Just continue to write.","Read books. They are good for us.","Failure is what we're all running from, we're always running toward success with failure at our back.","I consider writing practice a true Zen practice because it all comes back at you. You can't fool anyone because it's on the page.","When you bring the darkness to the table, it doesn't rule you or hurt other people, but when we keep it secret, it's dangerous.","Women need space and silence. We too quickly give away our energy. There's something about holding that richness.","When you write what you know, you stay in control. One of the first things I encourage my writing students to do is to lose control - say what they want to say, break structure.","Our job as writers is to listen, to come home to the four corners of the earth.","A writer's job is to give the reader a larger vision of the world."],"Natalie Gulbis":["When you fail you learn from the mistakes you made and it motivates you to work even harder.","You learn so much from competition you gain confidence every time you have to step up and perform.","My father got me involved in the game when I was four years old.","Pebble Beach. It is tough and the lay out is amazing.","My 2005 calendar we actually did a shoot in Lake Las Vegas. Since I had requests do some swimwear and athletic shots we tried them and they came out good so we inserted them into the new calendar.","My first calendar was a combination of photos taken from different shoots including golf and casual.","I enjoy watching Fear Factor, Newlyweds and American Idol as far as reality TV shows go.","As far as my journal, I want to share tour life with my fans.","The Longs event was the first LPGA event that I played in 8 years ago.","Nancy Lopez has always been a role model of mine... so to have the opportunity to play for her and spend time with her has been amazing.","I have worked hard to improve my consistency in my driving, irons, short game, and putting.","I played with Annika today. I love being paired with her. She does not make many mental mistakes, and she has the ability to repeat her swing over and over and wears people down.","I stopped playing in Jr. events when I was 12 and played women's.","I love to be in front of big galleries.","It's fun to come back to the town where I went to school and see all the new Wildcat players.","Hawaii was beautiful of course, we played at Turtle Bay an amazing resort right on the ocean.","It had been almost 30 years since the LPGA has played in Mexico. We are definitely looking forward to playing there next year and also coming back to play in Mexico in a month or so.","As many of you know I travel a good bit and do not get to see my friends and family as much as I would like."],"Natalie Imbruglia":["I'm such a chameleon. I never get bored.","I'm not a nightclub person, but you need to have a social life sometimes.","I like the idea of growing old gracefully and full of wrinkles... like Audrey Hepburn.","Saving animals is as simple as choosing synthetic alternatives instead of real fur.","There is no kind way to rip the skin off animals' backs. Anyone who wears any fur shares the blame for the torture and gruesome deaths of millions of animals each year.","I like singer-songwriters, and I find sad songs comforting rather than depressing. It makes you realise you're not alone in the world.","I can understand why some people might look at me and say, 'What's she got to be depressed about?' I get that a lot in Britain, where mental health issues seem to be a big taboo.","Happy songs are very difficult to write. How many truly great upbeat songs are there?","I am such a bad liar. I would like to lie, though.","I've done a lot of partying in my time because I didn't want to go home and I didn't know what to do.","You're only as good as your last record and you could get dropped.","I'm a perfectionist.","It's much easier to write when you're sad. But you can end up isolated and depressed because you almost need to put yourself in that situation to have that angst to write from.","I would have been happy to have waited till I was in my mid- to late-30s before I got married, but you don't choose when these things happen, and when they do, there's no doubt in your mind.","It's good to have to put yourself in someone else's skin. It's all-consuming.","The success of Torn was a bit too much for me. I took a year off and was still scared to start the second album.","You're either too fat or too thin. You just can't win.","You feel this pressure that people will take you more seriously if you play guitar, but I've decided I'm a singer and that's enough.","I know my music probably isn't going to matter to the public after I die, but that doesn't mean I don't have something to offer.","I seem to have very polite fans, not fanatical ones.","I worry unnecessarily.","Enjoy every moment: you never know when things might change.","I started dancing when I was three, Scottish dancing.","I'm quite confident with the way that I look but you find something else to focus on don't you if, I mean I, I have body issues that's my thing so you find something to focus on when you're a perfectionist, I think.","I wasn't born with a natural talent for songwriting.","It's not very often that I like new bands.","There are artists who think they have to be on top all the time. I think that would be exhausting.","I have never planned to have babies by a certain age.","I was brought up in an environment where my parents expressed their financial concerns in front of their children.","Divorce was very sad, obviously, but now I've gotten over it.","Since childhood I've always had a tendency to lean towards melancholy. My sisters suffer from it too, so maybe it's a genetic thing. But none of us has ever been on medication.","If I start feeling down I'll gorge myself on pasta. That usually does the trick. It's the Italian blood in me.","I've always been drawn to the four-leaf clover. It's deeply significant to my sister and me, so much so that we both have had it tattooed on the inside of our wrists.","I wasn't naturally drawn to fashion when I was younger but with my work I'm so exposed to what's out there that I'm hoping my style has become a little more sophisticated.","When I'm in London, I love to visit Kensington gardens and just sit in the park and read a good book.","My kitchen bench is covered with vitamins and protein powders. I go through phases when I'm sure I'm taking too many - but I don't get sick often.","Generally I can sleep any time, anywhere, any place, unless I'm anxious about work. I can get performance anxiety, so when I'm on tour it can be hard to sleep.","I'm a fan of homeopathy, acupuncture and spiritual healing. In Australia, this is not weird, but when I arrived in the U.K., everyone thought I was a freak.","I exercise three to four times a week, doing the Tracy Anderson Method, which involves toning and strengthening our small muscle groups.","Isolation is a big part of songwriting.","I think where men are credited for being strong, women are divas. I just think it's such a cop out.","When I'm passionate about something, I just get excited.","My mum said I told her I wanted to be a hairdresser during the week and a star on the weekend and that was when I was really young."],"Natalie Jeremijenko":["We ignore slow environmental changes unless they are crisis-driven, such as hurricanes in Florida.","In Yellowstone National Park, there are more 'do not feed the animals' signs than there are animals you might wish to feed.","The art world is a very prissy little thing over in the corner, while the major cultural forces are being determined by techno science.","Juggling many projects and having all these accidental collisions that you can't predict enables a kind of comparative thinking. To focus on a single project from beginning to end is extremely difficult, not just for me, but for many people.","A lot of my work concerns a crisis of agency - what can we do?","I used to have a lovely Chelsea loft - then I got divorced.","Experimenting with your own life is the most fundamental medium we have.","I am committed to the idea of information politics. That is how contemporary politics are played out.","Wealth and vegetation go together, and that exacerbates environmental injustice. The poor bear the burden of degraded environments.","Formally, I did my studies in the sciences, but I was very conscious that I was being deprived of culture. While studying neuroscience, I was running a rock-music festival and was able to use that as a platform to explore what it takes to produce art for 20,000 inebriated 20-somethings.","I created a successful outdoor youth festival - the Liverd festival - against all good advice. It was a great way to explore and investigate social sculptures. Having that as my kind of studio, outside of a museum or precious white-cube gallery, that was a kind of education.","This whole idea that we address environmental issues by not doing stuff just doesn't work.","I believe in a tongue-first exploration of the world. Food is our most immediate daily relationship to our ecosystem, and there is something delectable and intriguing about it.","Eating together is the most intimate form of kinship. By scripting a work where we share the same kind of food with fish, I'm scripting our interrelationship with them.","The idea that there is a rational truth out there that is not embodied in a person's politics is something I can't understand or subscribe to.","There's nothing wrong with being anthropomorphic. That's how we understand the world.","Information is not just something you download from the Web. The way trees grow and where birds choose to live are much better signs of water quality than all the data being collected by the EPA.","I watch children a great deal; their idea is that rules are always negotiable, whereas you absolutely cannot joke at the airport about your toothpaste, and you cannot rollerblade in Grand Central Station. I keep running up against these things.","Are kids smarter than adults? All evidence points to that being true."],"Natalie MacMaster":["I am a very musical person. I love music, and I don't just love Cape Breton fiddling, although it's my favorite.","I love jazz and pop rock and country. I grew up listening to Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Def Leppard, AC/DC, Anne Murray - if I hear something really great... I want to be a part of it.","When you return to the same area a few times, you get that frequent rapport with the public and the fans of the music along with having a certain warmth when you walk onstage.","There's some places where, I don't know if they're fiddle fans, or Natalie fans or if they just love Celtic music, but there's some places where there's just awesome crowds.","It's quite a job, so to speak, when you can really be with your child for 21 out of 24 hours.","I basically say I'm on tour all the time, because one tour goes into the next.","I've been hearing fiddle music since I was in the womb, I'm sure.","Living in Cape Breton, it's really all about fiddle music, so it's not like there were other instruments out there that tempted me and it was like I had to decide which one. It was automatically fiddle, because it's the predominant instrument in Cape Breton Island.","'In My Hands,' the title track, is my very first vocal attempt, and I'm not a singer as such. But I've always wanted to express myself vocally on my albums, and I don't really have much of a capability for singing. The strength is in, I think, the lyrics and just speaking. It just comes from inside.","Celtic music will always be around, even if with the mainstream crowds it dies out.","When I appear onstage, that's my departure from Momhood - and I transform into Natalie MacMaster: the entertainer, the fiddler, the performer."],"Natalie Maines":["The short hair fits my personality more. I think maybe, with long hair, it was a role - I was playing dress-up a bit.","I'm not out looking for a cause. They sort of find me or find my heart. But sure, there's always time for that. My big mouth can talk all the time.","Music is a personal preference. Everyone's free to connect and like whatever they want.","I don't want to put my fate in country music fans; I'm too stubborn.","I'm not good at multi-tasking.","I'm still in the Dixie Chicks; we haven't broken up... I love the Dixie Chicks; it's the most fun I've ever had in my life. It was like winning the lottery.","I sing all the time. But maybe nobody's hearing it, because I'm singing in my car or in my house or whatever. I don't need the roar of the crowd, and I don't need to hear cheers to feel validated.","I hate thinking about clothes. I hate shopping.","Growing up, I thought I was going to be Madonna. I wanted to be a pop star. I wanted to dance and sing.","My aunt is a newscaster in Lubbock, Texas, and she got a letter that said, 'Natalie Maines will be shot dead at their show in Dallas, Texas,' with the date of our concert. It was freaky to see that in writing.","I'm liberal on every social aspect, probably. More liberal than people would even believe. But there's still some of that Texas in me, as far as the gun debate. I wish there were no guns; I'm all for gun restrictions. But I'm also of the mind-set, if nothing changes, I'm getting a gun.","I knew I didn't want to make a country record just because that's not really what I would have ever made as a solo artist.","I'm a way bigger worrier than I ever was before I had kids. And, you know, the stress and anxiety that can go along with motherhood, I have had to battle that.","I think something happens to us biologically when we have children where the worry sets in immediately. And I don't think that ever goes away. But you have to fight your instincts to build walls up around your children or to want to shelter and protect them from everything.","I hope I don't have a big ego. I try to keep that in check. But I am a prideful person, I will say.","Writing for me can be homework. I do get a lot from it in the end. But I hate doing it.","I didn't grow up listening to country music. I pretty much grew up rebelling against country music.","I caught up on a lot of just domestic normal everyday stuff, and grew up a lot, and went to therapy, and did a lot of contemplating and figuring things out. I needed to just strip everything away and figure out who I am and get to know myself, as cheesy as that sounds.","I'm still finding my legs, performance-wise, being up there by myself. I think I have a bit of proving myself ahead of me.","People do look at it as an insult that I say I don't listen to country music, which cracks me up.","It's very scary to me that people actually think we should just follow our leaders. If we can't learn from our history, we're nowhere.","To me, I was right from the beginning, because it's my right as an American to speak up and question our president, have my point of view, have my opinion, question what I want to question, and say what I want to say about our government."],"Natalie Martinez":["I wanted to deliver babies and become a midwife. I think childbirth is one of the most amazing things you could ever experience, and I loved working with people and seeing the joys in family when they welcome a new member to it. It really brought me joy to be around that.","Being Latina for me is also being a strong woman.","I have to represent. I feel proud to have a culture that's different... and proud to be a Latina. We're not all categorized as one type of person... there's people from everywhere doing different things who have different types of cultures. Being Latina for me is also being a strong woman.","You're going to a bunch of auditions, and most of the time you're just getting denied, but just staying in there and keeping my head and being determined helped. Growing is what's challenging; you have to constantly practice your craft.","I love meat - I'm Cuban; I grew up eating meat, platanos, and arroz con pollo. I don't believe in starving yourself, but sometimes I do cleanses and diets to prepare for a role.","I love boxing, MMA, and hiking with my dog. I work out 3 times a week, and on my off days, I do yoga to keep my body relaxed and to stretch.","The thing with Stephen King is that everyone dies, and everyone comes back to life. So you never know with his mind where things go. It's the same with Steven Spielberg, too.","I make a bomb vaca frita. It's like a flank steak like with the ropa vieja, but it's fried with garlic and lime. And I make a really good picadillo.","My family lives in Miami, and I always envision myself, if something happens, it'd be like 'The Day After Tomorrow' where I walk across country to find my family. That would be the kind of person I would be. I feel like I wouldn't be as scared. If it happens, it happens. You face it.","I like to play 'Battleship,' and I also like 'Wordle' on iPhone. These are good things to play while you're on set. 'Words with Friends' is also great.","I think the last game console I had was Super Nintendo. I remember once I played the Sega Genesis. But Super Nintendo was my last game device. I played outside more. I liked kickball and baseball.","'Dance Dance Revolution.' That's a lot of fun when you're having a dinner party and you just want to be a little silly.","I was a huge 'Street Fighter' fan, and I actually still am. The only game I really was good at was 'Street Fighter.'","I do eat what I want. I love meat - I'm Cuban: I grew up eating meat, platanos, and arroz con pollo. I don't believe in starving yourself, but sometimes I do cleanses and diets to prepare for a role. I choose a lot of greens, proteins, and fats, and I like to be really active.","My favorite car is a '69 Barracuda.","I like cars. I know some things. I can change my own car and battery and change my own oil.","Cubanas are very strong women. So don't mess with us - don't take us for granted!","I usually get all my stress and anger out at the gym. But when I get out, I'm kind of a pleasant person - really."],"Natalie Massenet":["My personal ambition remains the same - to be creative, to be modern, to stay one step ahead, to enjoy life.","The interesting thing about London is that there are always stylish surprises around every corner.","Having the positive belief that it will all be O.K. just means that you hustle and make it work because failure is not even an option in your own mind.","Always go into meetings or negotiations with a positive attitude. Tell yourself you're going to make this the best deal for all parties.","Positivity is like a muscle: keep exercising it, and it becomes a habit.","Never forget that you only have one opportunity to make a first impression - with investors, with customers, with PR, and with marketing.","One of my goals is that, at a dinner party some time in the future, someone will say, 'Oh, my nephew is starting a ready-to-wear brand', and 20 people will turn around and say, 'Is he? Can we invest?' in the same way that, now, if you were to say, 'My nephew is starting a mobile app,' everyone would say, 'Oh, smashing! Can I invest?'","Ambition is important. Of course you can't get anywhere without talent, but there are a lot of talented people. To succeed, you have to be the most ambitious talented person.","If you want success, be unique.","I think there will be an increasing convergence between content and commerce, that it will be about following consumers instead of making consumers come to you, and I am especially excited about the various platforms that will allow more and more access to customers.","As much as I love to shop online, I also love walking the streets on a beautiful day and seeing what finds I can discover in a small shop or vintage store.","I don't have a mentor in the strict definition. I take as much advice and inspiration as I can from the people I am close to.","I believe all positive things and negative things are valuable because they shape you.","I think I'm a better mother because of work, because I'm happy. If I wasn't working, I would just be waiting for the kids to come home every day, and living vicariously through their lives.","Net-a-porter is an environment where a woman can really indulge, browsing through more than 160 brands in our fashion playground.","I attended private Catholic schools in Paris and Los Angeles through high school.","Once you start a business, you have to grow it and grow with it - starting a business is not just for Christmas.","What seems like a crazy idea today eventually grows. It's a 'with hindsight' thing. One day, someone will turn around and say, 'That was genius.'","I thrive on competition.","It's a false assumption that people with a lot of money have a lot of free time to shop.","I always thought I looked kind of like Keith Richards, and sometimes I think I look like Michael Jackson in his mug shot. But as I think Keith Richards is pretty great-looking, I'm embracing that part of me.","Work means independence. It allowed me to shape my life on so many levels.","I think fashion is actually very good training for being in the tech world, because it's all about moving on to the next thing, looking for the next thing, not getting stuck in the past.","In 13 years of doing my day job, I've learned a few things about motivating people. It's about setting a vision and, as long as everyone knows why they're doing what they're doing, you achieve that vision.","I believe that all brands will become storytellers, editors and publishers, all stores will become magazines, and all media companies will become stores. There will be too many of all of them. The strongest ones, the ones who offer the best customer experience, will survive.","Pregnancy is a very creative phase for me.","I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, with an English literature degree and travelled for a year before going to work.","I don't work out but generally I am fit, which is why I don't work out.","I borrowed a creaky laptop from my husband, went into the web, and never came back.","Moving to L.A. when I was 11 was when my entrepreneurialism started because it's the land of the American dream.","People ask if I walk around and pinch myself. Yes, I do.","I'm supporting the School for Creative Startups because the project's ambition - to boost innovation and the culture of entrepreneurship - is something I feel strongly about.","Grown-up clothes are more appealing because customers need to be able to project themselves into them.","You can get a slouchy woman's tunic at different price points. But if you want a great pair of trousers or a dress with delicate pleating, you're going to have to spend a little more.","I envision a day when a businesswoman will be having lunch, and then her phone will ring. When she opens it up, she will see an image of the latest Marc Jacobs coat that just arrived in stock. With a click of a button, she can purchase it and then find it waiting for her when she gets back to her office.","Even if I am predisposed to shop online, I see bricks and mortar as part of marketing.","Britain has the most creative, dynamic and nimble fashion industry in the world.","Bling is good.","The British Fashion Awards gives us the chance to commend not only the winners but celebrate all of the individuals that contribute to the incredible achievements that make London the best fashion destination in the world.","As a woman, I feel it's important to support causes that are important to my core customer, who is also a woman, as well as causes that resonate with me personally.","My father always had people around the house who were famous psychics.","It is a changing world with changing opportunities.","You cannot underestimate the impact the Internet has had on British fashion.","The United Kingdom has traditionally been a very small market, and even though you had such a creative group of designers, they represented a risk to department stores.","Pre-Internet, maybe it took six months for a fashion message to get across to a customer base. Fashion messages are now being sent out overnight, simultaneously, to every market in the world.","You can still wear trousers and show off your ankles - which are a nice body part on everyone.","Dear London, British fashion is a serious business. The British fashion industry is worth £21bn to the U.K. economy and employs 819,000 people across the country. With your help, we would like to see these numbers rise for the good of our industry, our talented designers, and our reputation worldwide.","A tendency to focus on art over business has meant that too many designers have failed to make the most of their critical acclaim.","People always say to me, 'You've really strived to redefine retail.' But the reality is, I wanted to redefine magazines.","I realised at a certain point that if I was going to have the kind of life that I fantasised about, I needed to get my act together.","I'm the laziest person I know.","The only time I can't sleep is on a plane, when I am literally keeping it in the air with my brain.","When I'm working, I have a hard time switching off, and when I'm not working, I have a hard time thinking of ever wanting to work again.","I've taken the love of fashion from my mother, and journalism from my father.","I see ghosts.","Contrary to popular belief, I'm not always trying to stand out.","100% of Net-a-porter customers have a man in their lives in some capacity, and 59% are married or living with a partner.","When I started Net-a-Porter, I knew nothing. And I was pregnant. Starting a new venture and being pregnant for the first time are pretty similar in many ways. If you knew what was going to happen to you, you wouldn't venture down that road.","As an entrepreneur, what drives you has to be the good news; otherwise, you just don't get out of bed.","Brands will increasingly handle their own e-commerce and rely less and less on local distribution partners. Why should they give away their profit margins?","I am honoured and excited to be taking on the role of chairman of the British Fashion Council.","My experience is in merging extraordinary creative content with innovative global commerce.","Success begins at that magical moment when you declare to yourself, your friends, and the universe that you believe you can do something different.","Don't let the American accent fool you. I am British.","Customers want new things, and the way that they get them isn't written in stone.","To be a designer today is to be an entrepreneur. Whether you're a two-man operation in Shoreditch or a 3,000-person, vertically integrated brand, you need to have the wherewithal to run your business through investment, considering everything from start-up funds to your exit plan or what it takes to go public.","We're seeing a crazy appetite for people to acquire and invest in British businesses.","You can no longer just have a magazine that shows you this glossy impervious image of women - in the studio, artificial, wearing a push-up bra.","I cry at anything remotely touching - smile at me warmly and I'm off... television also does it, everything from 'X-Factor' to cereal commercials. I cry when I am tired. I also cry when I laugh.","My dad taught me never to be afraid of what's on the other side of the mountain.","Even without an economic downturn, women sometimes want to keep their shopping habits to themselves.","We haven't even begun to see just how many transactions are going to take place online.","I attend Internet conferences all the time, and they literally make the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.","Women just love to shop.","For Net-A-Porter and its customers, luxury means exceptional service, 24-7 - wherever they are, whenever they have time.","If you're a teenager in Palo Alto launching an app, you know from the outset how you plan to finance your business.","I just wear what I like, and lots of it is British.","I have donated money to campaigns. And I have been known to take to the street in protest. But I am more committed to my immediate politics than general politics."],"Natalie Merchant":["Poetry comes alive to me through recitation.","I'm going to be shaking my booty when I'm 55.","Literature gives us a window into other people's experiences in other places, in other times, so I thought it would be really interesting to investigate how different people had written about motherhood, and childhood.","I don't want to live in a culture of despair. I'd like to live in a culture of hope.","It's funny, I remember doing the Johnny Carson show, and, uh, I couldn't afford my rent.","I would say I'd rather dig a ditch, you know, do hard, manual labor than write lyrics.","Be true to yourself, and, um, don't worry about some large companies' quarterly profit index.","I'm on this search trying to figure out exactly who I am and what I have to say to people.","I've found out how overwhelming the media is and the way it drills things into your head, it's almost like a mind control. If I could control prople's minds, I'd like to put something useful in.","I can't remove the autobiographical slant from the things I write. You always bring yourself into what you're writing.","I think of myself as a musician and not a celebrity. Celebrity status is something you have to deliberately pursue - I couldn't imagine myself seeking that.","The research phase was really fascinating - I'm not a closeted nerd, I'm an out-of-the-closet nerd.","I wish I had appreciated my youth - I should have worn tighter clothing when I could have!","My mother was a single working mother; she started having children very young. There was a tension inside her about who she wanted to be and what she wanted to do and how she couldn't achieve the things she wanted to.","I've raised my daughter with no television.","I was shy. Bookish. The kind of 13-year-old girl who, instead of having a boyfriend, would have a crush on a dead, 19th-century author!","It's really wonderful to be able to be nobody, and then have a moment when I can be somebody, and then go right back to being nobody again.","I don't think women's prisons are environments for dance routines, and I don't think mass murder is humorous."],"Natalie Morales":["I feel better all day if I start off by eating healthy. Breakfast is simple: multigrain toast with natural peanut butter, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit, or healthy cereal.","Furniture is meant to be used and enjoyed.","If someone is not treating you in a way that you like, remember that there are so many nice people out there. The problem is that when you love someone, you make excuses for that kind of behavior.","One hazard of our job on TV is people are always checking us out and noting every pound we've gained or haven't quite lost.","I would have loved to have met Buster Keaton.","At restaurants, I try to tell them not to bring the bread basket, but what's the point of going out to eat if I can't enjoy it?","To me, running is therapy. It's mood-altering and gets my endorphins going. It's also a great release and a great energy builder.","Some of the best writing I've done, whether I'm shooting a story or thinking of a script, I write it in my head as I'm running. Running literally jogs my brain.","My dad was a big runner. Growing up, I watched him do half marathons, and he was always running six or seven miles.","In high school, I did a little track and field and ran on my own. In college, I would run every now and again, but I didn't have enough time to be devoted to it.","You could pack for a trip to Europe with the bags under my eyes!","I have crazy eyebrows, so it's crucial to tame them. Just like your hair, they set off your features.","The first thing I do after work is take off my TV makeup with a gentle cleanser. I also try to exfoliate twice a week. Waking up with dull, flaky skin is no way to start the day.","Audrey Hepburn, for me, was the end-all, be-all style icon.","I learned what looked good on my petite frame, and to this day, I'm a great bargain shopper."],"Natalie Portman":["Cute is when a person's personality shines through their looks. Like in the way they walk, every time you see them you just want to run up and hug them.","I don't love studying. I hate studying. I like learning. Learning is beautiful.","Well, right now, I'm very fascinated with 1920s Berlin. I mean, probably the more interesting thing would be to go to the beginning of civilization or precivilization - like polytheistic times. It would be interesting to see what came before modern religion and culture - what circumstances created the environment or the need for it.","I'm a Gemini, so I change my mind every day.","Jasmine is just the most delicate and beautiful scent.","There's always pressure, from other people and yourself. If you're happy with the looks you're born with, then what are you going to do your whole life? We keep thinking up new things and finding better ways of doing things because we're not happy with what we're given.","Awards are so unnecessary because I think we get so much out of our work just by doing it. The work is a reward in itself.","Smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women.","Everyone dreams of living in Paris.","I don't mean to criticize anyone in any way that I wouldn't criticize myself. I think people should have fun, and have a good time, and enjoy the luck that we have to be lazy and dwell in consumerism. But I think that it's a balance. And our job as actors is empathy.","My dad's a doctor, and when I was 8, I went to one of his medical conferences where they were demonstrating laser surgery on a chicken. I was so mad that a chicken had to die, I never ate meat again.","I always think the most romantic books or films are the ones where the romance doesn't happen, because it makes your heart ache so much watching it.","They tell me: 'OK, this is where we're going to push up your cleavage,' and I'm like, 'What cleavage?'","I loved school so much that most of my classmates considered me a dork.","When a guy tells me I'm cute, it's not something desirable. Cute is more like what you want your pet to be.","I'm afraid of everything. But maybe when you're afraid of everything, it sort of seems like you're scared of nothing.","Ninety per cent of how you learn is watching great people. When you are surrounded by good actors it lifts your performance.","I'm going to college. I don't care if it ruins my career. I'd rather be smart than a movie star.","Where I live, nobody who's fourteen is having sex and doing major drugs. And I think if you see it in the movies, you may be influenced by it. I think it's so important to preserve your innocence.","I usually dress very casual. Whenever I go out with my friends, I'm always like, 'Can't I just wear sweatpants?'","I always ask myself, would I want someone to do something that wasn't comfortable for them just to please me? And the answer is no.","Going to a party, for me, is as much a learning experience as, you know, sitting in a lecture.","There's so much else to do in the world. To just be interested in doing films would limit my life.","I tend to lean toward strong female stories. I want to make things that don't already exist out there.","When I was in nursery school, the teachers asked me, y'know, 'What does your dad do for a living?' So I said 'He helps women get pregnant!' They called my mom and they were like, 'What exactly does your husband do?'","A movie about a weak, vulnerable woman can be feminist if it shows a real person that we can empathize with.","I remember how to be a person by being around them.","Committing yourself to one person is sacred.","I don't think I've ever been in love, I'm sure I will be some day. I've had enormous crushes, although I've never been into the Brad Pitt thing.","I speak fluent Hebrew and even dream in Hebrew when we visit there, once or twice a year.","I love milk so much! I make a point of drinking a glass of milk every day. So now anyone who did those milk ads with the milk mustaches, they're my heroes.","I was, like, a total cliched '80s child. I had Barbies, obviously, as well as My Little Ponies and Cabbage Patch Kids, but I used to destroy them. I used to draw all over their faces and cut off their hair.","I grew up in the classic American-Jewish suburbia, which has a whole different sense of what it means to be Jewish than anywhere else in the world.","I want every version of a woman and a man to be possible. I want women and men to be able to be full-time parents or full-time working people or any combination of the two.","My father has a general rule. He says if I haven't done it in real life I shouldn't do it on-screen.","Young actors often don't think of the consequences of doing nudity or sex scenes. They want the role so badly that they agree to be exploited, and then end up embarrassing family, friends, and even strangers.","I am not someone who sacrifice all for the cinema, my life will be always more important.","'Star Wars' hasn't changed my life at all.","I've stood up to producers before, and even a director. I saw them being abusive. A lot of people on the set are scared to say stuff when they're not being treated right.","New York is more where art is bought than where art is made.","Breast implants gross me out. I don't think they're attractive at all.","I like acting for now. But after seeing Apollo 13, what I really want to do is to be an astronaut. I'm dying to go to a space camp next summer!","I think school is so much harder than real life. People are so much more accepting when they are adults.","I was really into dancing, taking six classes a week, and my real dream was to be in a Broadway show.","I'm always on the phone because I'm usually not with the people I want to be with.","If you're an actress or a musician, everyone thinks you're hot.","It scares me to think that one day I'm not going to be in school anymore.","It's always strange being a kid on the set, because you're treated like an equal when you're working. But then when you break, the other actors go back to their trailers to take naps and drink beer, and I have to, like, go do school.","The best part about being friends with your parents is that no matter what you do, they have to keep loving you.","When I was 7 years old, I put on shows for everyone at my grandpa's funeral. I was always the little entertainer.","There are movies where we are interested in seeing people's lives without agreeing with what they're doing.","The only place I am recognized all the time is in L.A. and otherwise, it's only about once a day. I feel pretty anonymous.","I was really excited to get to shave my head - it's something I'd wanted to do for a while and now I had a good excuse. It was nice to shed that level of vanity.","I don't have a normal job, so I really appreciate having friends who are writers and artists. It's fun to have a group of people you can call in the middle of the day to go for a hike.","I'm not convinced about marriage. Divorce is so easy, and that fact that gay people are not allowed to marry takes much of the meaning out of it. Committing yourself to one person is sacred.","I was definitely different from the other kids... I was more ambitious. I knew what I liked and what I wanted, and I worked really hard. I was a very serious kid.","I'm pretty hard on myself in general.","I don't know if acting is what I want to do for the rest of my life, it's just what I've, you know, ended up doing when I was little, and I've kinda grown up with it.","You know, I get much more Jewish in Israel because I like the way that religion is done there.","I'd like it if people thought I was Jewish looking.","I remember as a kid being really scared of the Smurfs.","Obviously it's much easier to say that you're going to follow your passions when you're financially secure, but at least we can take solace in the fact that we now have the time to pursue the things that we really want to pursue because now the option of doing things just for the money isn't necessarily there.","I love being a mum, but it's much more intensive work than being an actress - going to work feels like you've got a day off. Not that I want a day off from being a mum; it's just perhaps I had this impression before that mums don't work. But they work more than anyone.","I think all girls in the world wish they were a Parisian girl - that sort of effortless chic confidence and comfort in their own skin.","I don't know who would not classify themselves as a romantic. I think that would be sort of sad."],"Natalie Wood":["At night, when the sky is full of stars and the sea is still you get the wonderful sensation that you are floating in space.","We were descended from royalty.","My mother used to tell me, No matter what they ask you, always say yes. You can learn later.","I never saw film stars at home. We had no maid, no cook, no swimming pool.","I was so young, and making movies, going to the studio every morning at dawn was magic.","Stardom is only a by-product of acting. I don't think being a movie star is a good enough reason for existing.","The only time a woman really succeeds in changing a man is when he is a baby.","We all wanted to copy Vivien Leigh.","There are certain stars who are not actors. I don't want to be that type.","I thought it was a wonderful line - right on the cutting room floor.","I never knew motherhood could be so truly gratifying until I had Natasha.","I didn't know who the hell I was. I was whoever they wanted me to be.","Today's films are so technological that an actor becomes starved for roles that deal with human relationships.","I'm just going to have to grow old, because I'm too terrified to have anything done.","I was so overprotected, I used to think I was as delicate as people said I was.","Almost every girl falls in love with the wrong man, I suppose it's part of growing up.","Not even analysis, by itself, can transform you. You must still do the changing yourself.","When I get married it will be for keeps.","Warren and I are friends, but working with him had been difficult.","The times that I have done something that I didn't respond to emotionally right away, it's generally not worked out too well.","Sometimes when I visit my sister and her two children, I wonder if she missed a lot by getting married. Right now, nothing could be further from my mind than getting married.","My friends seem much more excited about my doing Anastasia than Brainstorm... and to tell you the truth, I feel the same way.","If I didn't believe in what I'm doing, I'd rather go to work in a dime store.","The constant attention is what is so difficult.","I've been terrified of the water, and yet it seems I'm forced to go into in on every movie that I make.","I'm not very bright about money. I'm not domestic either. If I don't learn how to cook, maybe I won't have to.","I saw my parents as gods whose every wish must be obeyed or I would suffer the penalty of anguish and guilt.","I didn't like children. I didn't think of myself as a child. I didn't like any of the things other children were interested in.","I couldn't even go to the bathroom alone. My mother or a social worker always went with me.","From ages 10 to 12 or so, I barely remember anything.","For the first time I feel an inner emotional security. There is reality and dependability. My life revolves around Richard and the baby.","A lot changed when I had Natasha. I'm a survivor."],"Natalie Zea":["I think, especially when you're on TV, once you become associated with one genre or the other, it's near impossible to break into the other one, even if you have experience with both.","I've actually done a lot of comedy.","I think television scripts have become really intriguing and well-done. And writers have stopped drawing any actual line between film and television they used to never cross.","When I started, I had a really hard time getting work. It was the mid- to late-nineties. There was the WB. My age was perfect for it, but I just never came across as a youngster. I had to grow into my age in order to start working, and by the time I did, it was when things started to get good.","I don't know that I could play a complete and total mess. After awhile, I think I would be like, 'No, none of that!'","There is something about my aura or essence, or whatever, that draws the ex-wife characters to me. I don't seek them out, but people tend to think of me for that particular archetype, or whatever you want to call it, and I don't mind it. I think there is a strength to it.","I think every major character I've played was originally for an older woman. I have no idea what that says. I guess I'm mature for my age.","I'm at my best when I'm working. I just recently learned how to find balance and deal with downtime and take advantage of it.","I'm like a packrat with work. I hoard my jobs.","I am telling you, if you ever wanted an ego boost, leave your job and then, six months later, come back for a day. People will treat you like you're a princess.","My parents divorced when I was very, very young, but they maintained an incredibly amicable relationship. They were great partners, they were great parents, and they were great friends throughout my whole life until I was about 25, at which point they realized that they could relinquish; they could call it and move on.","I know it might seem a little superficial, but every actor has their thing. Some people focus on the walk, but for me, it's all about the nails and the voice. Those are the two most important things.","Outside of 'Justified,' I do like to keep it to comedy. When I'm not there, I try to seek out stuff that sort of more along the lighter fare. I have more fun on those sets than I do on drama sets just because when it's heavy, it's heavy, and it's hard to get away from it.","I really enjoy laughing at work, and I find that it's easier to do that when you're shooting a comedy.","I really enjoy getting to go and play on other people's shows for an episode or two. It adds such variety to my repertoire.","I've been trying to get into comedy for years. I had a meeting with one of the networks a couple years ago, a general meeting, and when they asked what I was looking for and I told them I'd prefer to do comedy, it was as if I had two heads.","I won't name any names, but I've done a couple of shows where once the pilot got picked up, the creators openly said, 'I have no idea where we're going.'","As I age, I become more and more happy with what I see in the mirror. At some point, that's going to stop.","There's something sort of intrinsic in being a Southerner that doesn't go away. You can't get rid of it, but it's not something that's terribly obvious.","I'm drawn to the romantic aspect of a character. It's human emotion. It's much more fun to watch. And it's much more fun to play.","I'm not a big lingerie girl. I see it, and I love it, and I appreciate it, and sometimes I even buy it, and then it never gets worn. It just seems like kind of a wasted middle step. Either you're dressed or you're not. What is this in-between stuff?","I just feel like the days of a handful of executives making the decisions for the entirety of the human public have gone on long enough.","The fact is that viewers are fickle and it's rare that such a large group of people can be categorized in any type of way. There's enough content to go around, and if we stop focusing on numbers and start focusing on the quality of the project, then I think everybody - viewers and artists alike - is going to be a lot happier.","I was a theater geek, and I was a surly cheerleader, and that's really kind of a contradiction."],"Natalie du Toit":["Swimming is my passion and something that I love.","It doesn't matter if you look different. You're still the same as everybody else because you have the same dream.","Even when bad things happen you have to try to use those bad things in a positive manner and really just take the positive out of it.","You have to work hard for what you want to achieve and you have to set goals and dreams and really go for them.","Once your dream is fulfilled you face another one.","The situation in disability sport is growing, and girls like Ellie Cole are doing wonders.","I have always had a dream to take part in an Olympic Games, and losing my leg didn't change anything.","It's been a dream for me since I was six years old to go to the Olympic Games and to finally have that dream realised is something massive for me.","I am always late because people stop me for autographs and say hi.","I say, 'If I'm able to go out there and achieve a dream, then anybody can do it.'","I don't think of myself as being disabled, or able-bodied.","I just want to be myself and go for my own dreams and goals.","When you are racing in an able-bodied competition, you're all equal and you go out there and try your best, and that's what counts.","Going out there in the water, it feels as if there's nothing wrong with me.","I go out there and train as hard as anybody else.","My parents gave me a boxer puppy as a present. I have wanted a dog for years and must first give her attention in the morning.","By 9:30 at night, I go to bed.","It is wonderful to say that your days behind a school desk are over. It's just another phase in your life.","I'm probably the most negative person around.","I've been lucky enough to travel the world and win awards and medals, but it was time to stop.","Back in my mind, I never, ever wanted to give up swimming; it was something that I would carry on with.","Qualifying for the Olympic Games was one of those moments where you just cry because it was like you've climbed Mount Everest.","I think I've achieved everything I wanted to.","I just missed out on qualifying for the Sydney Olympics in 2000.","My message is not just to disabled people, but to everyone: You have to work hard.","I never thought of being disadvantaged.","I hate seaweed.","I have a strong upper body; I'm an arms swimmer, and I always have been."],"Natan Sharansky":["Free societies are societies in which the right of dissent is protected.","Can someone within that society walk into the town square and say what they want without fear of being punished for his or her views? If so, then that society is a free society. If not, it is a fear society.","Will dissent be permitted? The answer to that question will determine whether the society is a free society or a fear society.","Of course, there can be serious injustices within free societies.","I have no doubt that given a real choice, the vast majority of Muslims and Arabs, like everyone else will choose a free society over a fear society.","Believe me, the drug of freedom is universally potent.","I was inspired to write this book by those who are sceptical of the power of freedom to change the world.","The three main sources of scepticism are first, that not every people desires freedom; second, that democracy in certain parts of the world would be dangerous; and third, that there is little the world's democracies can do to advance freedom outside their countries.","This scepticism is the same scepticism I heard a generation ago in the USSR when few thought that a democratic transformation behind the iron curtain was possible.","My optimism is not based primarily on the successful march of democracy in recent times but rather is based on the experience of having lived in a fear society and studied the mechanics of tyranny that sustain such a society.","By helping readers understand these mechanics, I hope they will appreciate why freedom is for everyone, why it is essential for our security and why the free world plays a critically important role in advancing democracy around the globe.","In contrast, fear societies are societies in which dissent is banned.","People may believe that there can be a society where dissent is not permitted, but which is nonetheless not a fear society because everyone agrees with one another and therefore no one wants to dissent.","It is important to remember that some of the most serious thinkers once thought that democracy was not compatible with the cultures of Germany, Italy, Japan, Latin America and Russia.","Japan is not a Western democracy. The Japanese have kept their traditions, culture and heritage, but they have joined the community of free nations.","Just as the 99% of Soviet citizens who supported the Soviet regime in 1985 was no indication of what the people inside the USSR really thought, the army of true believers that we think we see in the Arab world is an illusion.","The central premise behind Oslo was that if Arafat were given enough legitimacy, territory, weapons and money, he would use his power to fight terror and make peace with Israel.","Unfortunately, little attention was paid to how Arafat ruled. In fact, some saw the harsh and repressive nature of Arafat's regime as actually bolstering the prospects for peace.","Only weeks after Oslo began, when nearly all the world and most of Israel was drunk with the idea of peace, I argued that a Palestinian society not constrained by democratic norms would be a fear society that would pose a grave threat to Israel.","On the other hand, if the free world is concerned with how a new Palestinian leader governs, then the peace process will have a real chance to succeed.","The message of the free world to any potential Palestinian leadership should be a simple one: Embrace democratic reform and we will embrace you.","By focusing once and for all on helping the Palestinians build a free society, I have no doubt that an historic compromise between Israelis and Palestinians can be reached and that peace can prevail.","Arafat rejected the deal because, as a dictator who had directed all his energies toward strengthening the Palestinians hatred toward Israel, Arafat could not afford to make peace.","To understand why dictators have a problem with making peace - or at least a genuine peace - the link between the nature of a regime and its external behavior must be understood.","Democratic leaders, whose power is ultimately dependent on popular support, are held accountable for failing to improve the lives of their citizens. Therefore, they have a powerful incentive to keep their societies peaceful and prosperous.","It is not surprising, then, that in the decade since Oslo began, Arafat used all the resources placed at his disposal to fan the flames of hatred against Israel.","Non-democratic regimes always need to mobilize their people against external enemies in order to maintain internal stability.","The only peace that can be made with a dictator is once that must be based on deterrence. For today, the dictator may be your friend, but tomorrow he will need you as an enemy.","The two most important things that can be done to promote democracy in the world is first, to bring moral clarity back to world affairs and second, to link international policies to the advance of democracy around the globe.","When we are unwilling to draw clear moral lines between free societies and fear societies, when we are unwilling to call the former good and the latter evil, we will not be able to advance the cause of peace because peace cannot be disconnected from freedom.","I am optimistic that peace can be achieved in the region because I believe that every society on earth can be free and that if freedom comes to the Middle East, there can be peace.","There were no dissidents then in the USSR because they were all killed."],"Natascha McElhone":["Scribbling things down is my therapy. I filter later.","My concentration span is truly that of a gnat. Some people have this ladder, and that's all there is - the ladder. I have the ladder, too, but there's a building around it with scaffolding, and lots of windows for me to peek into. Then suddenly I'll remember, 'Oh, there's the ladder. I should be concentrating on that.'","In terms of 'Solaris,' I didn't really think about the religious aspect an awful lot. There's one scene at a dinner party, and it's discussed, but it wasn't an overwhelming theme for me.","Growing up, I wasn't allowed dolls, and my brothers weren't allowed guns. I inherited my brothers' clothes. I was never dressed in pink, and they were never dressed in blue; there were none of those rules that people still bizarrely subscribe to.","I think it's incumbent on actresses to bring something else to the part which isn't in the script.","I always keep myself busy. I'm writing. Or I'm creating something. Or I'm doing stuff with the kids. I'm up incredibly early in the morning; I go to bed incredibly late at night.","I think the difference between finding happiness, or moments of happiness, is how you choose to interpret things. That's a rather shocking responsibility. That we're responsible for our own happiness. It's not those around us.","It's how the '70s were for movies, the 2000s are for TV. I think it's a phenomenal time for TV and to be involved in it.","Living with very limited expectations is a much more immediate way of living. You really do just make the best of everything you have. I guess kids have that ability; they wait in joyful anticipation of something rather than that sense of entitlement.","I've always looked old for my age.","I happen to find motherhood a very natural state, but I know a lot of other people don't.","I always think I love work, and I knew early on that I wanted to be an actress. Then I meet people who have truly dedicated their lives to acting, and I realise that I'm so completely in the back seat.","Some actors are like flowers basking in the sun - they love the attention, and the fans get what they want. With me it's different. I know the fans aren't getting what they want. And I'm certainly not getting what I want.","I have a massive divide between being a competent human being and being completely hopeless, when it comes to logic.","I was brought up by a Marxist rationalist stepfather, so I don't believe in the supernatural or religion or horoscopes, and the absolute nature of death is quite helpful for me. My husband was there, then he wasn't.","I play Nitin Sawhney's 'Letting Go' repeatedly, nonstop. I find it transformative. I'm so glad iPods were invented so I didn't have to drive everyone around me mad with the repetition.","I'm not religious. I was as a child, and like lots of people, I suppose, rapidly became very disillusioned with the whole thing. I also feel that organised religion has caused far more problems than it has solved.","Death is final. No it is not just final, it's worse than that, it's diminishing: the dead continue to decrease, to occupy less space.","I feel awful for women who are trying to raise kids on their own, with zero income and no fathers present - that's single motherhood.","My kids always say to me, 'Can we watch TV?' I say, 'Absolutely!' because then I can get something done. But then they say, and I wait for it, 'But can you watch with us?' My moment of freedom vanishes. So not only do I not think TV's that great and I hate sitting in front of it, but I have to with them.","My grandparents never understood why my mother Noreen chose such exotic names for her children: Damon and me. My granny insisted on calling my brother Dermot - a good Irish name - until she died; I was just known as 'wee one.'","My granny was very concerned that we weren't baptised - Mum had been desperate to escape her own Catholic upbringing. But Granny thought we were blighted. Whenever we turned up at her house, she would flick holy water - from the font she kept by the door - over us, in the hope that it would save us from damnation.","Mum left school at 15, and after a few years of modelling and dating jazz musicians, was married by 21 to my father, Mike Taylor, a journalist on the 'Daily Mirror.' They had my brother and me pretty quickly and had split up by the time I was two. I don't really have any memories of them as a couple.","I'm very different to my mum. I'm not as beautiful as she is, nor - she probably despairs about this - as groomed. I certainly rebelled against her idea of looking well turned-out. I spent several years with a shaved head in jeans and baggy shirts.","My stepfather introduced me to The London Library when I was about 18; the clientele has definitely changed since then, but it is still a wonderful oasis in the middle of London.","I don't believe in categorising a gender, as it makes for discord. People always say, 'That's what men are like' or, 'That's what women do'; I don't really feel that at all. I think that's because I have two fathers, three brothers, a husband and two sons. I'm surrounded by maleness, and I couldn't possibly summarise them into a type.","I grew up with my stepfather in Brighton, but I did spend a lot of time with my natural father, and I was loved by both, so I suppose the advantage of this was that I wasn't bound by one set of experiences; I always had an alternative.","I first met my husband when I was 15. He was very cool, in a band, all that kind of thing, but he took a long time to grow up. Our paths crossed again 10 years later, and after about two weeks I knew that was it. I'm glad I met him when I did, even though I was fairly young. Because I think sometimes you can crystallise into singledom."],"Natasha Bedingfield":["I love arranging my music, not in alphabetical order but by mood, creating playlists for when I have energy and want to work out or go-out party mixes and music to chill out to.","I love lamb shank. It's my favorite thing. You don't have it in America. It's a younger meat - it just falls off the bone - it's kind of like a roast. I really like blackened cod too.","I don't want to be the next anyone. I just want to be me, now. And that means all different things.","The music technology scene is changing so fast it's hard to keep up.","I'm very honest in my music and I'm often asked to explain the lyrics; as an introvert, I find that quite hard. And I always wear high heels on stage, which can be painful.","I know I should keep this a secret, but Celine Dion is something of an icon to me.","A lot of my songs are about taking whatever life throws at you and making the most of it.","I did actually like school. When I was 17, I was in college, but before that, I was home-schooled. I was very social. I liked to know everyone.","I liked English and art and did a lot of painting. And for some reason I was good at math, but I wasn't an A student. I really had to work hard to get good grades.","I got a job as soon as I could - 11 or 12. I started babysitting and then I got a part-time job at a pharmacy in England. I just remember loving the feeling of going out and buying my own clothes! I'd go bargain-hunting and get secondhand vintage stuff.","My family comes from New Zealand, but I'm a London girl. I was born and raised in London, but I've got the blood of a New Zealander, so I always kind of felt like I didn't belong - in a good way.","I get very deep into the writing and recording process.","People don't listen to one radio station. On iTunes you can mix different worlds and bring country and pop and folk and live music together with a mass audience. I could have sung 'Easy' in a country way but I just sang it how I sing. I think it's a really nice blend.","The common denominator is a love of music.","Music is a very powerful thing. If I'm angry, I can write a song about it, and it seems to make everything okay.","I would love to do something with Coldplay.","I like doing very high action things. Running, boxing, a lot of free weights. They're not heavy. I eat what I want, really, because I think that while you're working out you can eat better.","As a teenager I had friends who had little music studios in their bedrooms and garages. I'd go and play around; very soon, my hobby became a passion.","I took temp jobs, recorded a demo in the evenings and eventually shopped a record deal. All I knew was that I wanted to write songs; thankfully, I also got to sing them.","Write your own songs. It helps you to mean what you're singing, which will then make it mean something to listeners.","I wanted to write about relationships. But I didn't feel I had the experience to sing about them in a deep way. Studying psychology helped me out in terms of my understanding. I still look through my old textbooks when I'm in need of inspiration.","I'm the diva from the future. The next gig's on the moon. Catch me while you can."],"Natasha Calis":["I plan to go to university - but for sure, acting is what I want to do. It's a hard business, but I believe in my heart that I'll be doing it for a very long time.","I've been acting my whole life. I have this huge imagination! I'm a dancer and my mom's a dance teacher, and I was always performing and entertaining people. I'd go to see live theatre or a movie, and I'd become the main character for a few days afterwards. I loved being somebody new for a temporary amount of time.","I put my friends and family first. I'm really just a normal thirteen-year-old girl who has a different hobby than most girls my age. Acting is kind of an extracurricular activity.","What I love to do requires portraying different characters, and you have to separate your life from the role.","When I was seven, I asked my mom if I could be on TV, and she said if I really wanted to, I could. I got an agent and booked my first audition."],"Natasha Hamilton":["I love anything quiz related.","Every four weeks I go up a bra size... it's worth being pregnant just for the breasts.","I'm taking one thing at a time. With the children and launching my solo career it would drive me to a nervous breakdown if I tried to organise a wedding on top of that.","Each time I've gone to the studio, the songs have got better and I've got more confident.","If I like it, it's gonna be on my album. You can't please everyone.","We're all grown women now; if we wanna do something, we can't be stopped!","Anytime you get an audience that's paying attention, you enjoy it more."],"Natasha Henstridge":["I never forget my old days and I never fly too high I have my feet fixed firmly on the ground!","I began as a model, but that did not really hold my interest for too long! I believe I stood out from the parade of models trying to make it in Hollywood, which helped launch my career beyond the one-night-stand horror movie.","Where is this Hollywood scene, where is it? I'd like to find it one day... If I want to go out and have a good time, I go to New York.","Even my parents are so cute, and they deal with every movie of mine excellently. They check with me ever so casually by asking 'Now how much of nudity are we going to see in this one?'","I believe that every role that I have done this far has had quality and content. My roles have been very demanding and every role has been a challenge and a learning experience that has helped me mature as an actress.","I guess Species was a movie made for me and hence I bagged the role. In fact even when acting, I never thought the outcome would be so good which I think it was! The entire role was a challenge. I was to be this strange yet sexy thing which was challenging!","I started off as a model and struggled for some time until I got a break as an actress. I was too stubborn to let go and was sure I was in the right place at the right time. I just fought and I think that's how I am where I am today.","I think I have been very lucky as far as my acting career goes.","I was a tomboy right from the time I was a kid and loved to be like that. I'd hate all the girlie things. Well my best friends as a kid have been boys. I get along best with the opposite sex. I guess that's the case with most people though!","My main aim has always been to do good quality films with roles that have some substance. With Power and Beauty there were loads of things that I liked about the movie, which made me opt for it.","The nude scenes were a little eerie and I felt a bit odd. Yeah, when the camera scanned up my body, I said to my friend, 'Now, that's a close-up.' I mean, you see every inch of my body. But I'm okay with it and so it was cool.","Today, I guess I give a lot more thought to the roles before I sign them.","Well, I have a couple of projects in the pipeline, but I'm taking things slow for now and being choosy about the roles I take up. One thing I can assure you of is that you are going to see a lot of me!","When I started off, I didn't only ride to fame on my looks though many people I know think otherwise.","When you're doing some things that are damaging you, you don't really realise it at the time.","It is kind of cliche to say you like a man to smell like a man, but I really do. My husband can go three or four days without taking a shower and the man never smells."],"Natasha Leggero":["The women's movement ruined a permanent vacation.","My friends who have babies can't do anything. You can't go out at night. Having a baby is like a DUI from the universe.","I love hard punch lines, and I like anything that has a strong point of view.","My dream part would be to play Mitt Romney's sarcastic black maid. We could call it 'Mammy & Me.'","Pop culture, it's crazy. There's all this violence in video games. In 'Call of Duty,' people are literally just blowing other people up. Hey, let's protect your country from your couch while eating your sandwich.","I have friends who say, 'You just can't understand what it's like to be a mother until you're a mother.'","Guys should not be allowed to use the Internet all day long. So sad.","What's great about stand-up is that you can say whatever you want and go around the country, and sometimes the world, and work on it and see how people react. You don't need Standards & Practices or notes from lawyers or producers to tell you what's funny.","There's something grounded about 'Ugly Americans,' so I think it's good that I'm playing a version of myself in these elevated cartoon circumstances.","Neil Hamburger writes such cutting jokes.","When I was 23, I moved to Australia to be with this 43-year-old con artist I fell in love with.","Anything you can do to get more people to come to your live shows is good, because that's where you can really do what you do. Everyone's on the same page, and you don't have to win strangers over as much.","There are some die-hard 'Chelsea Lately' fans, and that's where the majority of my fans come from. Chelsea is really helping make comedy audiences hipper and edgier.","Coming from the Midwest, I didn't know about stand-up as an art. I just thought stand-up comedians were old men in suits talking about their wives.","I do think people are definitely sick of the Kardashians.","For comedians, we're all kind of tweeting our thoughts instead of spending time developing them. You can gauge how good a joke might be by how many times it gets retweeted, but it takes discipline to go back through the tweets and then develop jokes from them.","Comedy is just one of the many professions that women are taking over.","My comedy isn't about being attractive - it's about how the bar of dumb seems so low right now, and I desperately want to raise the bar of dumb just a tiny bit.","Often when you are starting out in comedy, you will find that people will laugh at the things you didn't think were funny. It's important to pay attention also to what people are laughing at when you are just talking in regular conversation. Often that is when you are truly being yourself.","I'm not 'one of the guys.' I don't want to pretend to be one on stage. I'm not going to dress like a guy or carry myself like one.","I was very lucky when I started doing comedy because I hadn't seen much stand-up. I just got up on stage and did it without thinking.","I was raised Catholic in Rockford, Illinois. But I'm not a practicing Catholic anymore. Oh God, no.","In L.A., you tend to see a lot of people do very bizarre things. I love it.","In general, comedians are attracted to vice.","Doing TV is great, but TV is for starring on, not for watching.","I don't think I ever wore pants on 'Reno 911!' and I was on it about five times.","If you look at NBC, two of their most successful shows - '30 Rock' and 'Parks And Rec' - are written by women, produced by women, and I think that's the future. Women are the new men.","You can always tell an actor by the bored look in their eye whenever someone else is talking.","The corporations are shoving just the worst music down everybody's throats, and I think the result of that is that nobody has any taste. They have no bar as to what is good.","I grew up as a child actress, not a child star. I was an actress - big difference.","I always wanted so much glamour in my life, so I have always been obsessed with class, and from dating a few people who were from old money and a few from new money in my 20s, I just sort of became obsessed with this idea of clueless rich people.","The chasm between rich and poor is becoming larger, and I think it's interesting terrain to talk about and expose."],"Natasha Little":["I was told it might be quite difficult to conceive, so it really was a great blessing when my pregnancy suddenly happened. I had been diagnosed years ago with polycystic ovarian syndrome, which can affect your fertility - but luckily, in my case, it didn't.","As an actor, I'm in such a privileged position because my work is job by job. If something doesn't fit in with family life, there's more flexibility.","Having my own family has made me realise there's more to life than chasing the next job.","I love my work, and I feel fortunate to be doing a job I love, but it isn't the centre of my life.","Acting was a slow-burn thing. I found it was something I really, really liked doing, but it wasn't until my third year at drama school that I actually thought, 'Oh, right, I'm trained for this now; I'd better see if I can do it.'","I wouldn't feel comfortable talking to someone I didn't know very well and, beyond that person, a readership of X millions, about things I think are private.","I know some people are really comfortable with talking about their feelings and hopes and fears in public, but I'm not, and I don't think it's that extraordinary.","My family weren't actors, and we didn't know any actors. It wasn't even something I was aware you could do as a job. I thought you had to be a Redgrave or a Barrymore before you were allowed to go to drama school.","It's funny landing parts now where I'm somebody's mum. I remember the first time I was asked to play a mum. I was easily old enough, but because I didn't have any children, I thought, 'That seems really grown-up.'","Being an actor does make you aware of your age.","I've been very fortunate.","Getting older doesn't bother me. When I was 30, I thought I should have achieved more, but you get more comfortable and think it's time to stop putting pressure on yourself.","I know it sounds ridiculous, but I haven't quite got over the miracle that you plant things, and they do sprout up.","I love acting. It's what I do, not what I am.","I love rehearsing; it's the best part of the job.","By the time I was 10, I had lived in 11 different countries.","I'm not cool at all. I'm the least cool person I know.","I have this sense of humour which is about as sophisticated as a seven-year-old schoolboy. I get very overexcited and silly.","I'm guilty of it myself, sort of thinking, 'Classic novels: snoozeville.' But there is a huge amount of wonderful material.","Period drama is such a huge umbrella term: it seems to cover everything from Claudius to something from the 1920s.","'Pride And Prejudice' takes place in a similar period to 'Vanity Fair,' and yet there's a huge difference between Jane Austen and Thackeray.","I really like working, the opportunity to work with good people and to play interesting parts.","It might be quite boring if you did something and thought it was perfect.","I've enjoyed all the work I've done, and I feel quite lucky that I haven't been playing sweet girls all the time.","I've never, ever done a piece of work - and can't imagine doing a piece of work - when I've thought, 'I was pretty perfect in that.'","You can finish the day's filming or the whole shoot or watch something months later and think you could have done it so much better. It's frustrating."],"Natasha Lyonne":["It's a wild thing, that people have the ability to help each other by just relating to one another.","I started wearing all black around the time I got into Nirvana. I first heard 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' when I was about 12, and I remember jumping on my bed, so excited about it.","I'm somebody who believes in funny things, and laughing, but I do like for them to come from a place that addresses the human condition.","As a woman, I've learned that having a uniform of your staples or setting your look and saying what distinguishes you - like red lips or hair or whatever - leaves so much time for the rest of the day.","The thing about curly hair is that it's a toss-up. Some days you can let it air dry and it's better than a hair-do, but some days you just look like a sloppy person. I'm really resistant to a trim. I only do it when it gets hard to brush out in the shower, then I'll submit, begrudgingly.","I would love to option 'Crying of Lot 49' and turn it into a movie.","In my experience of living, for a time, in the underbelly of society, I spent a lot of time in various holding cells.","I learned that if you're going to be a troublemaker, you don't want a ton of witnesses, because there's inevitable fallout from living like you're in 'Lord of the Flies.'","The aging process is totally minimizing. Life in general is pretty minimizing because you have a lot of big ideas, and you have to battle the mistaken delusions and instability that come with youth.","It's such a weird thing: to sit and look at yourself is so distracting to the psyche. It would be like me standing in front of a mirror and looking at myself all day, trying to find a flaw.","There are epic downsides to living a somewhat public life. The upshot of that is there's nothing to hide. It's a relief in a way. There's nothing about me that can't be said.","I'm not someone who went to acting school - I was just out of the gate, doing it.","I feel like I just have such the blood and bones of a New Yorker that I can almost imagine better, like, giving up the fight and not being able to afford the city and going out West, keeping a small place here, and then when I'm like 80, coming back here, living on the park and going to the theater.","I would have done well as a gypsy child, I think. A circus baby. I coulda played a great street urchin or ragamuffin. Or just been one. I certainly liked entertaining people and making jokes, but I don't know necessarily if that's what your child is prone to that you should necessarily put them in a real working industry at six years old.","I don't really feel like I need to be a teenager ever again.","I have a lot of friends who are trying to clean up their act, or that are still making trouble for themselves, so I'm definitely well-versed on what goes on in the mind and the heart of a person who self-destructs as their coping mechanism, and also what they're like when you take their preferred substance away.","Life is a wildly transient thing with people coming into your life and dropping away. It definitely takes work to maintain relationships.","The world at large doesn't always make sense to me, and there are safe havens. Linda Manz in 'Out of the Blue' is one of them.","My family moved to Israel when I was eight until I was 10, and then we came back, and my parents split up. I was suddenly in a single-parent home and on scholarship. Fifth grade was such a hard year for me.","I have a theory that self-made, first-generation actresses don't feel entitled to success.","I do have an outsider's complex of getting made fun of. I was made fun of as a kid, and I don't have the stomach for it.","As wild as I was, when the cops show up, and suddenly you're being handcuffed, it's so deeply shocking and terrifying, the loss of freedom.","I adore Eddie Kaye Thomas and Jason Biggs. Eddie was the only one who called me when they were doing 'American Reunion' and told me, 'You need to do this.'","There's something great about all your worst fears coming true and being said about you. There's a tremendous liberation on some level.","Beauty was never really my trip. Maybe those roles are attracted to me?","I will take the subway and look at certain women and think 'God, that woman's story will never be told. How come that lady doesn't get a movie about her?'","I often think my boyfriend is going to leave me just from seeing how I talk to the dog. But you know, when you are talking to your dog, you are accessing this softer side of you. Everything else melts away.","Rather than spend so much time wondering if I'm going to get hired, or is it a problem that I've got this black-tar history, I've just got to keep doing what I'm doing and try to be decent.","My hair is such a statement that it's like a neon sign asking for trouble.","You've got to do something with all the books you've read, so you might as well imagine you've optioned them.","I have to say, I'm still surprised anyone's nice to me, that anyone talks to me. But I think people understand that other people go through things. We're all a bit gonzo, and you're allowed to take a little time to get your head on straight.","I was this kid who had been raised in New York, and now all of a sudden, my mother decided that she was a Jewish divorcee and therefore she should be living in Miami Beach.","You compare yourself to somebody who you think is a peer, and you can totally lose the plot, and not understand that you are nothing like them in the first place, and it was never you versus anybody.","From the first instant I met her, I wanted to be Nora Ephron. I just really wanted to please her.","That's usually how I get to know strangers - get inappropriately touchy. Once they've experienced the awkwardness of you being way too close for comfort, after that, it all gets easy.","Let's face it. I'm an open book.","Anormal day looks like, you know, shower, put on the same jeans, the same tattered Gucci loafers I got at the thrift store, white socks, and my t-shirt and my very beat-up Helmut Lang blazer. I'm in the exact same outfit every day.","I'm not to be confused with Natasha Henstridge in 'Species,' where I just emerge out of the weird alien womb looking amazing. I really rely heavily on my black outfits and my gold chains to give me sort of a thing.","If I was a bajillionaire, I would spend a lot of time at Barneys just buying all kinds of great things all the time. I would have so many black cashmeres it would be out of control. I like the way nice things feel very much.","I have a pretty fancy facialist, this woman Dale Breault. Getting older, it's a good thing to have a serious facialist.","There are beauty icons that I can never be like, sorta like a Gena Rowlands - I'll never have that look. I love Giulietta Masina, the great Fellini actress. But I'm probably more Seymour Cassel. Or somewhere between Lou Reed and Nora Ephron?","As a New Yorker, or wherever I am, I just want to know I can get our of the house in five minutes if I have to and not have to spend a bunch of time obsessing in the mirror, trying on a million different options. Now, I just know what works.","I grew up in Manhattan, and I've always had all kinds of people around me. I've always had a very 'live and let live' point of view.","I have a deep compassion for the idea that it's okay to be myself. The idea that anything 'other' is bad and wrong and broken is so wildly off base.","I always see the absurdity in most situations. It's my experience of how life works.","When I was a young person working, everybody was older than me, so I had to kind of keep up. I'd see every movie and listen to everything played, and read all the relevant books. Being an actor, it's kind of your job to know what came before you and how big your feelings are allowed to be.","It's not easy trying to navigate your internal world in the public eye."],"Natasha Poly":["I think the skin is the most important thing. If you take care of your skin, you don't really need much makeup.","I like Dolce & Gabbana's fragrance Light Blue - it's my everyday perfume.","I like doing my makeup myself! It's a hobby of mine. I like to play around. I've learned all the best tricks from the pros!"],"Natasha Richardson":["What's in the movie compared to what we shot is the tip of the iceberg.","I know the pressures of being the daughter of a great actress. But it's inspiring. You learn so much that other people don't get to learn until later on. My father being a director, I learnt a real work ethic.","What my father especially taught me was to not always take the safe road, the easy road. If you are going to do good work, you have to risk failing badly.","As I grew up in that world and saw how much it affected her world and how much it affected our childhood, it made me very aware of politics. Of course, I have my own private feelings and thoughts, but I don't care to share them.","I've played comedy before but not that much. I mostly do get drawn to darker material.","I'm not the kind of actress that goes home with the character. I mean, you're thinking about the work or the next day's scenes, but not staying in character. But as a film goes on, you become more and more fragile, emotionally. And physically too, actually.","I knew that for this movie to work it had to be very hot and very real, and it wasn't going to be a case of doing it Hollywood all covered with a nice little sheet.","A film is a director's vision... there is, however, much input an actor or actress can have.","The degree that these scenes went to... there was a couple of days I was upset... I'd have to hurry back to the girls in the makeup trailer and have a bit of a cry because it messes with your head.","I wake up every morning feeling lucky - which is driven by fear, no doubt, since I know it could all go away.","I always felt too young and selfish to have children of my own.","Part of the reason for moving to New York was the sense that it just didn't matter how much work I did in England, I continued to be seen simply as a Redgrave. I did feel I could be who I am in New York and we all like to feel appreciated.","I was definitely incredibly close to my dad, in a way that was all-encompassing. I am close to my mum, too, but there were areas that she and I did not share. So his loss to me was huge, personally and professionally. He believed in me, not just as a father, but as a director, and that always meant a lot."],"Natasha Trethewey":["In the early 1970s in Atlanta, I attended what had formerly been an all-white school but had become a black school after integration and white flight. Perhaps because of this, the teachers created a curriculum that included a focus on African American literature and history year-round, not just in February.","Isolated and unincorporated, North Gulfport lacked a basic infrastructure: flooding and contaminated drinking water were frequent problems. Although finally incorporated in 1994 - not long after the arrival of the first casino - many of North Gulfport's streets still lack curbs, sidewalks, and gutters.","Growing up, my birthday was always Confederate Memorial Day. It helped to create this profound sense of awareness about the Civil War and the 100 years between the Civil War and the civil rights movement and my parents' then-illegal and interracial marriage.","My own journey in becoming a poet began with memory - with the need to record and hold on to what was being lost. One of my earliest poems, 'Give and Take,' was about my Aunt Sugar, how I was losing her to her memory loss.","People always want to be on the right side of history; it is a lot easier to say, 'What an atrocity that was' then it is to say, 'What an atrocity this is.'","It took me years of attempts and failed drafts before I finally wrote the elegies I needed to write.","For a long time, I've been interested in cultural memory and historical erasure.","The first thing I tried to do in the months after losing my mother was to write a poem. I found myself turning to poetry in the way so many people do - to make sense of losses. And I wrote pretty bad poems about it. But it did feel that the poem was the only place that could hold this grief.","I overheard things in the Woolworths when I was a child, people saying, 'Oh, poor, little thing,' as if they had some understanding that I was being born biracial into a world that was still very difficult for interracial marriages and biracial children.","When I write notes in my journal, I'm just trying to scribble down as much as possible. Later on, I decide whether to follow some of those first impressions or whether to abandon them.","I am interested in 18th century natural philosophy, science, particularly botany, the study of hybridity in plants and animals, which, of course, then allows me to consider the hybridity of language.","When kids look at broccoli, they call it 'little trees,' because they see it not just for the word 'broccoli.' They see it for what it looks like, the image. We, as adults, forget to think like that. We forget to think figuratively and have to be reminded.","When you begin to think about the past, you realize how much of it is lost to us.","I want to be the best advocate and promoter for poetry that I can be.","Writers, particularly poets, always feel exiled in some way - people who don't exactly feel at home, so they try to find a home in language.","From the catbird seat, I've found poetry to be the necessary utterance it has always been in America.","Dismissals of poetry are nothing new. It's easy to dismiss poetry if one has not read much of it.","The experience of poetry could bring my mother back to me. Poetry offers a different kind of solace - here on earth.","I started out in graduate school to be a fiction writer. I thought I wanted to write short stories. I started writing poems at that point only because a friend of mine dared me to write a poem. And I took the dare because I was convinced that I couldn't write a good poem... And then it actually wasn't so bad.","It is a tremendous honor to be named poet laureate, but one that I find humbling as well, because it's the kind of thing that makes me feel like - even as it's been bestowed upon me - I must continue to live up to what it means... Being the younger laureate in the age of social media is a new challenge.","On a very personal level, I have fond memories of spending a lot of time in the Library of Congress working on my collection of poems 'Native Guard.' I was there over a summer doing research in the archives and then writing in the reading room at the Jefferson building.","My parents had to go to Ohio to get married in 1965 because it was still illegal in Mississippi. My white father and black mother.","I think I felt at some point that I couldn't understand poetry or that it was beyond me or it didn't speak to my experience. I think that was because I hadn't yet found the right poems to invite me in.","I think there is a poem out there for everyone, to be an entrance into the poetry and a relationship with it.","My name is Natasha Trethewey, and I was born in Gulfport, Mississippi, in 1966, exactly 100 years to the day that Mississippi celebrated the first Confederate Memorial Day, April 26, 1866.","When I was born here in Gulfport in 1966, my parents' interracial marriage was still illegal, and it was very hard to drive around town with my parents, to be out in public with my parents.","My father, Eric Trethewey, is a poet, so I had one right inside the house. And on long trips, he'd tell me, if I got bored in the car, to write a poem about it. And I did find that poetry was a way for me, I think as it for a lot of people, to articulate those things that seem hardest to say.","As much as we love each other, there is some growing difficulty in my adult relationship with my father. Because we're both writers, we're having a very intimate conversation in a very public forum.","Before I was ever a poet, my father was writing poems about me, so it was a turning of the tables when I became a poet and started answering, speaking back to his poems in ways that I had not before.","When I'm actually writing by hand, I get more of a sense of the rhythm of sentences, of syntax. The switch to the computer is when I actually start thinking about lines. That's the workhorse part. At that point, I'm being more mathematical about putting the poem on the page and less intuitive about the rhythm of the syntax.","The more I've gotten interested in writing about history and making sense of myself within the continuum of history, the more I've turned to paintings, to art. I look to the imagery of art to help me understand something about my own place in the world.","Writing 'Native Guard,' I didn't know I was working on a single book. I began writing that book because I was interested in the lesser-known history of these black soldiers stationed off the coast of my hometown.","The entirety of 'Bellocq's Ophelia' was a project, and I was interested in doing research and looking at photographs and writing about them, imagining this woman Ophelia and what her life was like and the kinds of things she thought about.","I know that my tendency is to be linear, and I'm trying to find ways to subvert that. And so in 'Bellocq's Ophelia' my device for subverting it was to tell the story and then to tell it again; it always circles back to this one moment, and it's not linear, but it's round in that way, and much of 'Native Guard' is like that.","My mother was murdered by my step-father, my brother's father, who was also named Joel, twenty-five years ago. Whatever sadness or burden I've been living with since then, my brother's also been living with, but he's lived with the added burden of having the exact same name as our mother's murderer.","I think that it's hard enough being an adolescent and wanting so much to fit in with your peers, your schoolmates, and to erase any sign of difference, to be part of the group. And being biracial but also being black in a predominately white school marked me as different.","Often people would mistake me for white when I was younger, and I didn't correct them; there would be a period of time that they just thought I was.","My mother and my father divorced during the time that my father was getting his Ph.D. at Tulane.","I think poetry's always a kind of faith. It is the kind that I have.","One of two historically African American communities that sprang up along the Mississippi Gulf Coast after emancipation, North Gulfport has always been a place where residents have had fewer civic resources than those extended to other outlying communities.","When I was growing up there, North Gulfport was referred to as 'Little Vietnam' because of the perception of crime and depravity within its borders - as if its denizens were simply a congregation of the downtrodden.","I find myself frequently introducing myself to someone, saying that, you know, I've grown up black and biracial in the United States.","I think that as a poet, I am always concerned about history and baring witness to history. But so often, it's through the research that I do, the reading.","In my own life, I believe it was an early education in poetical metaphor that helped me to grapple with and make sense of all the difficult and traumatic things that were to come.","Often as a poet I find that I am somewhat outside an experience I want to hold onto, consciously taking mental notes or writing them down in my journal - for fear that I will forget. It's not unlike being on a trip and taking pictures, your face behind a camera the whole time - the entire experience mediated by a lens.","I love mystery novels... I love seeing the dramas played out in academic departments, particularly English departments. I started reading these when I was going up for tenure.","Even though I am the daughter of a poet, and my stepmother is also a poet, growing up, I didn't think I could understand poetry; I didn't think that it had any relevance to my life, the feelings that I endured on a day-to-day basis, until I was introduced to the right poem.","I've been telling my students, 'Imitate, imitate.' And they say, 'Well, what if I plagiarize, or what if I'm not original? I want to be myself.' And I always tell them, 'Your self will shine through'... If you allow yourself to feel deeply and honestly, what you say won't be like anyone else.","I was always very aware of the nature of the place where I was growing up in Gulfport, Mississippi, how that place was shaping my experience of the world. I had to go to the Northeast for graduate school because I felt like I had to get far away from my South, be outside it, to understand it.","It's so necessary to try and record the cultural memory of people. To set it down for generations to come. To better understand where we are headed. The problem is, a good portion of what we choose to remember is about willed forgetting. Which we all do, I believe, to protect ourselves from what is too difficult.","Even as I think of myself as a 'rememberer,' I also know my memory is probably doing all this work to reconstruct a narrative where I come off better.","My obsessions stay the same - historical memory and historical erasure. I am particularly interested in the Americas and how a history that is rooted in colonialism, the language and iconography of empire, disenfranchisement, the enslavement of peoples, and the way that people were sectioned off because of blood.","A poem I write is not just about me; it is about national identity, not just regional but national, the history of people in relation to other people. I reach for these outward stories to make sense of my own life, and how my story intersects with a larger public history.","My father is a poet, my stepmother is a poet, and so I always had encouragement as a child to write.","I think people turn to poetry more often than they think they do, or encounter it in more ways than they think that they do. I think we forget the places that we encounter it, say, in songs or in other little bits and pieces of things that we may have remembered from childhood.","I think the biggest thing that I have to do is to remind people that poetry is there for us to turn to not only to remind us that we're not alone - for example, if we are grieving the loss of someone - but also to help us celebrate our joys. That's why so many people I know who've gotten married will have a poem read at the wedding.","Poetry's a thing that belongs to everyone.","'Memory.' 'Race.' 'Murder.' That's what they say about me. I am an elegiac poet. I have some historical questions, and I'm grappling with ways to make sense of history; why it still haunts us in our most intimate relationships with each other, but also in our political decisions.","'NewsHour' is very interested in poetry, but they're also interested in not just that something's cute to add on at the end of their programming, but something that actually is integrated into the news.","I've been most happy to be an advocate for the kinds of grassroots things that people are doing who care about poetry.","I think often people don't realize the great diversity of Southern writing because in their minds, if you're not from the South, it can seem regional and small, and of course that's not the case at all when you start to read the work.","Often it seems that there are writers who are their best selves on the page. That Seamus Heaney was as genuine and deeply admirable in person as in his poems was to me a gift, then as now."],"Natasha Tsakos":["As a street performer, I have learned that everybody wants to connect. And that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance, then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud. It's as though you made something resonate within them.","I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives, and I know theater can heal. I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years. I have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy. I know theater unites us.","I love theater. I love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else, and look at life with a completely new perspective. I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen.","I was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show, and began developing 'Upwake.' 'Upwake' tells the story of Zero, a modern-day business man, going to work with his life in a suitcase, stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two. I wanted 'Upwake' to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would.","I find theater very lazy and artificial, and then when it's not, it lacks refinement."],"Natassia Malthe":["I didn't have any friends, and I never went to the class parties.","I'd like to someday see myself married to my true love and starting a big family, and at the same time still having an artistic job.","Working on my knowledge and education and learning how to become a more talented and wise person make me feel more sexy.","When I'm in professional mode, I do the best job that I can.","It gets boring to me when people talk about clothing brands or what boat they're going to buy next summer.","I kinda lose my mind in 'Fringe,' or at least my character does. Whenever I'm acting, I tend to accidentally become unable to switch off the character. I'm a little bit of a method actor, but without really wanting to be.","I'm very kinesthetic, and when you're that way, you just feel it in your body. I know that other actors think with the logical part of their brain, but I wear my character inside my body, even when I'm away from the set."],"Nate Berkus":["You will enrich your life immeasurably if you approach it with a sense of wonder and discovery, and always challenge yourself to try new things.","I like my house to be unique to me. Sure, I've bought plenty of things out of a catalog, but the way I put them together in my home is special. You might have bought your sofa at a major home decorating store, but the rug you found at the flea market is so unique, it takes your room from 'carbon copy' to 'simply yours' in no time.","I have a large watch collection, and classic watches are especially important to me. I had a silver Rolex, and I actually gave it to my little brother. He wears it every day. He's an actor, so whenever he goes to an audition, he can look down, see it, and it gives him confidence. It was a great thing to pass on.","In a minimal interior, what you don't do is as important as what you do.","In a modern loft, you can't just fill a space with furniture. Each piece has to be perfect.","Mixing in some rusty oranges is a warm way to update your place for fall.","Everywhere your eye travels in your home, it should land on something that resonates with you.","I believe your home tells a story about who you are and who you aspire to be. We represent ourselves through the things we own. I don't believe in trends. I believe in collecting things that you connect with. We should surround ourselves with things we care about, that have meaning.","I was a boy with one dream and one dream only: I wanted - no, strike that, I was desperate for - a room of my own. You see, in those days I shared a room with my little brother, Jesse, and it wasn't pretty. He was the Oscar to my Felix: messy, careless, and just a little bit sticky - exactly the way a kindergartner is supposed to be.","You can find a lot of reasonable buys at Wal-Mart. But one key to making it on a budget is by donating your time and labor to the project. Do-it-yourself projects will always help you save.","When you buy things that are expensive, like a sofa or something that really feels like an investment, you need to keep it as plain as possible, as simple as possible. Make sure that it's a clean design that will work with whatever style you want it to.","We hold back our true feelings and beliefs, whether it's from a sense of being polite or fear of hurting someone's feelings. But what I have seen on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' is that no one benefits from holding back and keeping things bottled up inside. So I pride myself on speaking my mind and not being afraid to give honest feedback.","I knew that I was a gay boy fairly early; what was interesting to me was that my mother didn't know. She made me play baseball - I had no desire to do that. I said, 'Mom, I don't like direct sunlight, I don't like bugs, I don't like grass, and I'd rather be in the house playing with your fabric samples.'","My favorite thing about decorating is mixing different periods and styles. If you have something that's old, and you really do want to mix those styles, then you have to add something that's obviously modern with it. You can't put a kind of a mediocre thing in the middle.","I've always felt that color is intrinsically personal. It evokes a tremendous amount of emotion. If there's a color you respond to, that's something you can incorporate into your home. No one can tell you it's wrong.","They used to tease me at the 'Oprah' show, 'Are you really going to do another white Shaker kitchen, with white subway tile and stainless steel appliances?' And my answer is, 'I can vary it a bit, but I'm never going to err from classic materials.'","We're not handling things anymore before they arrive on our doorstep. I like to feel how thin porcelain can be, run my hand over a textile, see if I want to sit in a chair.","Everywhere in my house are these little things that have meanings and make me think of great memories.","I made my parents crazy. As a kid, I redecorated my bedroom every month. I would literally save my allowance and go buy things.","Some kids spent their allowance going to see 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'; I spent mine on a great-looking lamp I'd found at the flea market and a ceramic bowl from a neighborhood garage sale.","In a small space, you want to keep the bedding as simple as possible so it looks clean, calm and collected.","I see it every day: People trying to create a home that somebody else tells them they should have. I don't care if it's a magazine or a bossy friend - when somebody says, 'This is what's elegant, this is what's trendy,' if it doesn't represent you, you're not going to be happy.","I didn't grow up thinking I'd be a decorator. Design is my greatest passion, and it naturally just pulled me down the path. Same with TV. Being famous or having a show was never the motivation. I got a call and was swept up by the challenge of that first small space redesign.","'Priced to sell' - just the phrase makes me smile. When a dealer says all the items in his booth are priced to sell, he means he's tagged them as aggressively as he can to get you to buy them. Don't worry, though, I still haggle. You have to. That's the point of a flea market.","When you have a bunch of comfortable upholstered pieces, a single bronze or brass chair really turns the energy up.","Go outside! I mean, even leaves from a park are beautiful in a clear glass vase. I'd rather see that than fake anything any day.","I hate sets. I've always hated sets. I think that if you have a dining room set, break it up!","Color is a very personal thing. You need to make sure to choose a color that makes you happy. But I don't recommend accent walls - choose a color you can live with on all four walls.","Layering in different patterns will keep things from appearing too studied.","You can change the feel of your sofa by adding a thick, cozy throw and playing a couple of classic pillows off a more Moroccan-inspired one.","I love linen in soothing colors for any room in the house.","Books are the heart of any home, and I spend hours going through books for design inspiration.","I live in a beautiful vintage building that was built in the heart of downtown Chicago.","I was barely in grade school when I helped my mother rearrange the living room furniture for the first time.","I think I was the only kid on the block who knew about furniture scale by the time I was 8.","Working on 'Big Give' was an opportunity that I felt compelled to do. It was my chance to share in showing people how they can give big in their own life, to send the message that giving goes way beyond the gift of money. We want to share that the best thing you can give is your time and understanding.","As a kid, I think I rearranged the rooms of almost every house on the block.","If you actually keep things very organized and clutter-free, you can have more furniture than you think you can in a small space.","Buying found objects means repurposing something that was already made years before, sometimes decades before. It strikes a nice balance between the new and used equation we should strive for in our lives.","When I take on a design project, I have to jet from the bookstore to the hardware shop to the lamp store and back again just to collect a small portion of the many items I need to fill a home. But, when you hit the flea market, they're all right there. From booth to booth, you have the bases covered.","Before you begin designing or buying anything, you need to get real and ask yourself: What do you really want to use this room for? What do you want to do in this room but can't now?","I can change a light fixture, and I can do certain things. But I'm really bad in terms of construction. I can't do any of it on my own.","You don't need to spend a lot of money on stuff when you have amazing architecture.","A lot of guys go in immediately for status, as opposed to comfort and allowing their home to tell a story about them.","I think that a lot of guys reach for electronics first, but the truth is that you can never keep up with electronics. You buy a flat-screen TV, and then six months later, there's one that has 3D and Blu-ray and all this business, and that is just going to keep continuing.","You don't have to paint your walls lime green just to try to have your home feel decorated. If you're a classic dresser or preppy dresser or a modern dresser, you wear a lot of black - whatever it is - your home should reflect that as well.","Thread count is actually a lie. Just because a thread count is 1,500 on a set of sheets doesn't mean that they're well-made sheets. Truly, the quality of the cotton and the quality of the way something is woven is much more important than thread count.","The truth of the matter is being gay is the way I was born. I believe this to the core of my being.","One of the biggest lessons I've learned during my time on 'Oprah' is that everyone wants to be heard. We all want to have our humanity acknowledged - to have others see us for who we truly are. We all want to know that we are valued, we are heard, we are understood.","I don't believe in having spaces in the home that don't get used. We pay so much for square footage that to waste it is criminal.","I always want objects in my home that have a connection to me or something I've loved. It's still stuff, but it's stuff that has meaning.","I'm not going to say paint is an easy spruce-up. It takes time, it needs touch-ups, and you have to be very methodical. But it is worth it, and it isn't particularly expensive.","I can look at a photo and the dimensions of any piece and tell you if it's going to sit well with the four other pieces in your room.","It's my job to know what's available from every retailer, catalog, website, antiques mall, and craftsperson. A good designer or decorator has to have an almost encyclopedic knowledge.","When I see a wall that's hung with different objects, framed or unframed, what I like about it is its fluidity and rule-breaking nature. Just experiment a bit.","About 90 percent of the pieces in my home are vintage, and I'm a ruthless editor. I only live with things that I love. There is not one thing in my home that doesn't have meaning to me.","I didn't necessarily want to be famous growing up, but I knew I would be a good famous person because I'm not offended if somebody comes up to me and knows things about me and wants to engage me in a conversation.","You can't be around Oprah and not have her influence you, and I don't mean that because she's doling out the free advice. I mean it because she is someone that leads with truth and follows her heart. She's a force.","Twitter is a place where you share your thoughts, yourself... you don't want a plain white backdrop for that. You want the entire page to say something about who you are. Designer or not, if the urge strikes you, go for it. Put up that watercolor you've never shown anyone. Take a photo of that hat you just knitted... whatever it is, share it.","I always had this New York fantasy of living in a glass high-rise.","Home has always been one of the most important things. If I don't feel at home in my space, then I feel really unmoored.","In design-speak, 'a library' means a room lined with books, floor-to ceiling, but it all depends on the space you have. You may have a free-standing bookshelf of your favorite books if that's all you have room for.","I got my first Charvet knit tie when I was 15. I actually stole it from my father. I love them because you can wear them day to night. They're French and preppy and have been around since the 1800s.","I really can't live without my In-N-Out burgers. Honestly, I can't. Even when I'm doing the whole no-carb thing occasionally, I make an exception for these. They're too delicious to count.","I'm interested in fashion; I buy fairly good pieces, and I think as I've gotten older, I've pared down a lot.","I tend not to wear ties very often. I'm usually in old stuff: Hermes or Marc Jacobs boots and jeans and a T-shirt and a leather jacket or a jean jacket.","I do shop online! But I'm shopping online mostly in the home categories - One Kings Lane and Gilt. At a lot of architectural websites, I buy a lot of hardware for cabinetry like hinges and things like that from England. So, you know, for me, I shop at Net-A-Porter, but I don't really shop that much for clothing online.","First and foremost, I'm a decorator and product designer. Everything I do, the television shows, the books, that comes from the design work. It's what I love.","Design, to me, is part psychology, part sociology, and part magic. A good decorator should know what's going on in someone's marriage and how their kids are doing in school.","I am not ever in the business of making anyone feel bad.","Even as a 10-year-old, I remember trying to explain to my mother and stepfather how upset and frustrated a messy room made me. But they just couldn't grasp it. They wanted me to be playing with baseballs and frogs while I wanted to be scouring garage sales."],"Nate Corddry":["Lewis Black taught me stand-up.","Coffee shops are everywhere, especially in Los Angeles, chock full of sad sacks desperate to make sure their screenplays make it into the right hands... or any hands, for that matter. The one thing that makes a coffee shop truly great, though, is charm.","There are a lot of funny people in my family. Absolutely. There were a lot of jokes growing up around the dinner table, for sure. We didn't grow up in a creative family.","Both 'The Daily Show' and 'The Colbert Report,' you're working with the best. When you work with the best, you have to raise your game. If you're working with people who are sub par, you're not forced to give 100 percent because you can get by on 80 percent.","When you work at 'The Daily Show,' you have to give 100 percent, or you're gone. The competitiveness and the minds that work in those offices are incredible.","My manager has season tix to the Dodgers, four seats to 40 games, and they're right behind the plate, I mean, they're amazing, food and waiter service, which is insane.","I moved on from dice baseball to 'MLB: The Show' on PlayStation.","I have an issue with rage. I'm going to work that out, long term."],"Nate Diaz":["I'm trying to stay focused on what I'm doing. I don't want a whole lot of things going on - people to call back, or text messages or whatever. I chill out, relax a little bit, and then I don't have those issues.","I never did steroids in my life. I know all the fighters; they are all on steroids.","If I had been thinking business since I was 21, I'd be a rich man right now.","I'm not sure what the UFC's agenda is when it comes to me. It's their show, their press. They can change to whatever they want to do at any point. They own this thing. They can do whatever they want.","Whoever has lost a fight in the UFC and hasn't wanted to fight that guy the next day shouldn't be in the sport.","I want to fight the best guy. I always want to fight the best guy.","I always took a fight; I always took everybody. I fought everybody.","I walk around - people know who I am. I've got friends. I can make ends meet. I grew up around people who have been hustling from the start, so I think I've got a bright little future ahead of me - especially if I don't fight. Why would I want to go out there and fight with somebody, get my face punched and kicked. It's not my idea of a good time.","I win by submissions, knockouts. There's guys ranked above me, but no one's interested in seeing them fight. They want to see me fight.","My parents moved around Stockton and Lodi. I had a lot of anxiety about jumping into another classroom. They were always putting me in special ed. But I was smart; I wasn't like these kids in the special-ed classes. But it would make me feel a little bit stupid.","I don't come and fight for fun. I don't do that. I don't like to hurt people for fun.","It's just kinda irritating to me that we're awarding people in mixed martial arts for trying to move away and not finish the fight.","You know when I fight, I'm going to sell out the show. Everyone wants to see someone get knocked out or tapped out.","I try to cancel out every possibility of losing the fight, and this runs through my head all day long. I'm seeing myself become smashed in the face, cut, or being submitted or being knocked out in so many different ways all day long.","Money talks. I want the biggest fight. Whoever I've got to fight - the biggest show, biggest payday - that's what I want.","I'm fighting hard; I'm training hard. I'm still walking over people and stepping over people to get where I'm going, and I would really like to give back, especially to my mom, who was there for me when I was a kid.","Once I turned pro, I was like,' OK, this is not fun and games now. This is me. I'm going to come, and I work on karma. I'm not going to go after somebody if I don't have a reason behind it, so as soon as there is some sort of a reason for me to do something that I need to do, then I'll do it.'","I want to go against the best fighters. That's why I'm always calling out Georges St-Pierre. I don't have anything against Georges St-Pierre. I think he's a great fighter.","If anybody's getting a shot, somebody's getting a shot against me because I'm the guy to beat.","People don't understand: I've had 37 fights, three to five fights every year, for 17 years. That does something to somebody. These suspensions are the only vacations I've ever had.","It cost me a lot of money to have a vacation, basically. It's nice to step back and see there's more to life.","Me calling out Roy Jones is disrespectful.","I don't love to fight; I don't want to fight.","I'm scared of any fighter I've ever fought because they are some dangerous people to be dealing with. That's also where the anxiety comes from.","People like to talk a lot about me, about how I have anxiety or social disorders. I'll admit to anxiety, but it has nothing to do with media or being in front of a camera or being around people. It has to do with dealing with the sparring that I'm going to have or the workouts that I'm going to have from day to day.","If you don't find time to meditate and get all that negative out, and if you don't have the right people being positive around you, this is a very scary job to have if you don't learn how to control your fear.","I've lost fights before where I'm landing more punches and I'm moving away from the guy. So, the way that they score things at the end doesn't seem very consistent to me.","I can always do five, five-minute rounds, any day, even if I was drinking yesterday or doing whatever. I'm a seasoned athlete, an endurance athlete, and I'm always working out.","I don't see a superstar out there. I don't see Georges St-Pierre coming back.","There was a rumor I was walking around at 183 pounds. When I left my room to fight Conor McGregor, I was 179 pounds. That means by the time I walked in the cage, I was probably 175, 174 pounds.","I'm the only person in this sport, for the most part, that ain't on steroids. Now there's new rules in effect, yeah, you've got guys not on steroids now, but they used to be. They've always been on steroids.","I don't like not having a job. Especially when I started Mixed Martial Arts, this was all I could do.","Every fight, I'm fighting blind opponents. I don't know who it's going to be, who I'm fighting, if I'm really fighting them.","I need a vacation anyway. They fight me too much. I'm not going to be the one to back out of these fights."],"Nate Holland":["When the gate drops, it's time to try and execute the best you can.","Lake Pend Oreille is definitely my favorite place to be while in Sandpoint. I love to get out on a boat to enjoy water sports, camping, fishing, or just to relax and catch a sunset.","I try and find fun activities like mountain biking, hiking, or water sports for a workout rather than pushing weight in the gym.","I think my strengths are definitely - I'm a really good glider. I'm one of the fastest, like on a straight drag race, I can pretty much kill that.","Some days I'll have good starts, and some days I'll have bad starts. I'm really focusing on having more good starts than bad starts, and I traditionally do. But I would hate to make it all the way to the Olympics and have a bad starting day.","When I am behind and I am looking ahead and there is that line in front of you, of that guy, of winning and losing, then I really hang it out there and take big risks to make the speed up, and then I'm pretty good at passing.","Once a bustling logging town, Sandpoint has embraced its natural beauty to become an amazing resort town drawing people near and far to enjoy its beauty and recreational possibilities. It's truly a small town with a huge backyard.","Summertime is my favorite time of year in Sandpoint, reason being, Lake Pend Oreille is warm and ready for action.","Schweitzer is where I found snowboarding; it will always have a special place in my heart and is a top-notch ski resort. It has some of the best bowl tree skiing in the world and breathtaking views of Sandpoint and Lake Pend Oreille.","I've always had a strong start, but the start in boardercross is so important. And if you're not getting better, you're getting worse.","I go to all of the trade shows, know a lot of the people making marketing decisions, and I want to keep my finger on the pulse of snowboarding.","The X Games have done night and day for snowboarding and action sports.","My favorite team is the Bengals. In Idaho, we didn't really have a home team. But my parents are from Ohio, and when I was a little kid, my aunts and uncles would send me Boomer Esiason T-shirts and Ickey Woods mini-footballs, so I got hooked on those guys.","My best nutrition tip is to eat things you like that are low in calories and fat. Some of my favorites are chicken, rice, assorted veggies, egg white omelets, turkey sandwiches and protein shakes.","When it comes to working out, I really don't like the gym. I go because I have to, but I'm usually not happy about it. I do what my trainer and coaches tell me to do, but I'm always anxious to get outside."],"Nate Lowman":["I love language, and I love the failure of language.","I do not connect fashion to elegance. Elegance is in the wilderness, and fashion is in the domestic.","It's a shame when other people's gambling habits change the meaning of paintings or when fluctuations of value start to dictate how people perceive art because it's too expensive to be interesting or moving. That's when I get bummed out.","I'm really interested in the difference between selfishness and generosity. It confuses me to no end because sometimes it all just feels like pure indulgence on my part.","A lot of the images I use are already out there in the public or in the news. I just steal them or photograph them or repaint them, so they've already been talked about, already been consumed.","A lot of people use a smiley face when they write letters. But it's this huge insane compulsion, like 'I'm happy! I swear!' I'm not buying it.","I think of other artists as generous when I get inspired by their work. That's why I like curating. You don't want to take someone else's art and have your way with it. You've got to be respectful of them.","I don't have a great imagination to share something with you that you don't know, so it's about interpreting things - a dialogue.","I make images from things I find serendipitously. I don't know what it is, but I know it when I see it. It could be from a newspaper, on the street. It could be something I fell over.","I'm not a pessimist at all, but I'm not an optimist, either.","I was a pretty pretentious kid. I was always making art.","Dead people don't really die. They live on within you.","To me, a drop of oil paint or a xerographic dot are the same thing - they're all just language.","I do believe that I will see the apocalypse in my lifetime. And when it comes, I'm not repenting for anything I've done.","Architecture is a discourse; everything is a discourse. Fashion discourse is actually a micro-discourse, because it's centered around the body. It is the most rapidly developing form of discourse.","When you mix fashion and politics, you get fascism. Politics have fashion, and it's bad; fashion has politics, that are ugly.","I think that fashion is industrial, whereas style is ideological. So they're not necessarily connected."],"Nate Mendel":["If I could, I would have my son on tour the whole time. But he has school, summer camp, and he has to see his mother.","Popular ideas about AIDS are based on a hypothesis that does not stand up to scientific scrutiny.","How do you be a 45-year-old man in a rock band, do it well, keep your dignity and not become a parody of yourself? I don't think it will be simple.","Reiterating the belief that HIV is the cause of AIDS is an easy thing to do. Understanding the science and politics of the situation is much more complicated and requires study with a critical and open mind.","When a person tests positive for HIV, it is not a test for the virus itself but for antibodies to the virus, and the test is not able to distinguish between HIV antibodies and a multitude of other antibodies. Many conditions can lead to a false positive result, including flu shots, hepatitis, and pregnancy.","How is AIDS research to progress when the premise of science is questioning but the premise of questioning HIV is considered so dangerous that even venturing into the facts is too great a risk?","I have full confidence in the ability of Foo Fighters' audiences to distinguish between questioning HIV and the obvious value of safe-sex practices."],"Nate Parker":["I walked around feeling, in a sense, that people of color, we began at the bottom of a slave ship. We were enslaved; we picked cotton. There was Honest Abe, who wore a top hat and was taller than anyone and who said, 'Enough is enough; slavery must end.' And then, black people could stand up again. But after that, we didn't catch up.","Any psychologist will tell you that healing comes from honest confrontation with our injury or with our past. Whatever that thing is that has hurt us or traumatized us, until we face it head on, we will have issues moving forward in a healthy way.","I think patriotism is all about wanting to see America better, wanting to see those are oppressed do better and get treated better.","We have a tendency to sugar coat the Civil Rights movement by showing arm in arm and everyone singing 'Kumbaya'. We don't really always show the resistance from the government, the resistance from the status quo, from the majority to silence the movement.","The American dream is more about opportunity than anything else.","Identify your niche and dominate it. And when I say dominate, I just mean work harder than anyone else could possibly work at it.","When I was young, to have a big nose, big lips or dark skin was the worst. You were the wretched. That was something I not only felt, but I participated in.","I think chemistry and great acting go hand-in-hand.","Leadership is one of the things I really strive to excel in in my life.","I coach a high school wrestling team and a middle school team. I consider myself a coach and an activist, so I'm really involved in the community.","I'm a big Hall and Oates fan.","We all serve a purpose. My purpose isn't to be rejected. My purpose isn't to think small or to be introverted. This door closed is literally pushing me to the next door.","I just feel like if I really believe what Dr. King said, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,' then I should be compelled to use my God-given platform to effect change.","I prefer to make movies which not only have a message for 'then' but a message for 'now.'","Sadly, black people disassociate ourselves from the things which make us who we are, identifying them as lesser, or inferior. It's a form of self hate. So, with reckless abandon, we strive to be like the majority.","Let me be the first to say I can't remember ever having a conversation about the definition of consent when I was a kid. I knew that 'no' meant 'no,' but that's it.","All I can do is seek the information that'll make me stronger, that'll help me overcome my toxic masculinity, my male privilege, because that's something you never think about. You don't think about other people.","So if I'm 36, and I have my 19-year-old self, I'm pulling him to the side and saying, 'Listen bruh, throwing on your Timbs and your fitted hat and strolling campus trying to get a girl to say yes, or going to the club hoping you bring a girl home, that's not the way to go about healthy relationships. You need to step back.'","The crazy thing is a lot of people - a lot of men, if I'm just speaking for myself - don't really start thinking about the effect of hyper-masculinity and false definitions of what it means to be a man until you get married or until you have kids. Because then, all of sudden, you have something to protect.","I was very insecure approaching the idea of directing a feature film. I told myself I would not move until I felt I was moving in power rather than moving in desperation to make a movie.","I do believe, as a person of color, the disparities are great. A lot of the roles that were sent to me were 'Gangbanger No. 1.' And when a role did come up that I felt carried and represented my community in the best ways, I wasn't the only one that knew it existed. So I'd have to compete.","I'm a perfectionist to a fault.","You don't choose who you sit next to in a theater. You sit in a theater, and there's an energy that happens.","Women have been such an important part of my life. I try, every day, to be a better father to my daughters and a better husband.","The black community is my community - the LGBT community, too, and the female community. That is my community. That's me; it's who I am.","I never felt the need to introduce all the obstacles in my past when I say, 'Hello, my name is Nate.' But at the same time, I've never hidden from it.","I immediately felt the need, back when I was a managing tech engineer, to attach myself to Nat Turner. And to research him and learn about him and try to find ways into his life that I could apply to my life.","My father passed away when I was very young, so I was head of household for a very long time. Whether it came to cooking food or having to braid hair to get kids out of the door for school, I've been one that has - with the help of my mother - has been a father figure for a lot of young ladies.","So often, when we don't have people that can be representative or symbolic of leadership and of faith, of purpose, in that absence we become bitter and resentful.","I, for one, believe that partisanship should have nothing to do with the actions of Christ. You're either Christlike, or you're not.","I think, at some point, we have to be followers of Christ - not followers of White Christ, or any other color Christ, for that matter."],"Nate Powell":["I did grow up in a military family but lacked the perspective to grasp the cognitive dissonance carried by most people who serve in the armed forces or the circumstances that push lots of folks into the military. I don't blame G.I. Joe or Rambo for that atmosphere, but they certainly reflected the final stage of a two generation cultural myth.","Doing representations of real people is not my strongpoint as a visual artist, and I know that.","There's nothing that compares with the time spent all by myself on a creation that is all my own. I still think of my solo work as my 'home planet' in comics, though I've learned to listen much more to editors and trusted friends for feedback.","The comics I made from 1990 to 1997 were largely based in vaguely urban, vaguely dystopic settings because that was my reference point for comics storytelling in general.","I love trying to forge a contract between creator and audience in which we are able to meet halfway, each injecting a part of our own experiences into a story that's being told.","We all accept the visual shorthand used throughout comics: if something's farther away, it'll be drawn with a thinner, simpler line, eventually leaving out most visual information and becoming a gesture, a skeletal representation of a thing.","My sense of politics and justice was deeply shaped in adolescence by my involvement with the underground punk - rock scene, and though lots of social and political issues had come forth in my comics, it wasn't until my late 20s that I felt properly equipped to address certain issues of race, power, and violence in my work.","My narrative style centers around intimate, highly subjective depictions of personal experience and internal landscapes. In 'March,' everything fell into place as soon as I began identifying strongly with John Lewis as a young boy and saw how we shared the same kind of gravity and intensity as youngsters.","There are constant challenges in the drawing process, especially in a period piece, and therein lay the fun.","Comics creators are generally screwed in life: Most of us who are fortunate enough to do comics full time - which is very few of us - will literally draw until we die because we have no employment structures intact for retirement, much less insurance!","As a visual storyteller, a lot is learning what to include so you're not being redundant between images and text.","I am filled with uncertainty and fear when thinking about how my two daughters will grow into this world as Hoosiers, as Americans, as women and free thinkers.","Power, privilege, and violence are not, and never were, strictly Southern issues in America.","'Swallow Me Whole' is still the creation that's closest to my heart.","The truth is, I don't sketch much at all. I have a very visual/spatial brain that retains a lot of information about maps, directions, positioning, and details, so I usually prefer working out those issues on the page itself.","Kids have always play-fought, but I think my generation had a particularly privileged cultural fantasy surrounding military violence.","The books that stuck with me most as a child were 'A Wrinkle In Time', 'Dracula', 'Hatchet', 'Bunnicula', 'White Fang', and this YA/kids' book called 'Nobody's Fault' where a kid drowns one weekend as friends play around a flooded ditch."],"Nate Robinson":["My dad said, 'Stay humble, and you gotta work harder than everybody else.' My mom said, 'Always be yourself.' She always told me only God can judge me.","You don't have to be the biggest, tallest, strongest guy to do whatever you want to do. You can do anything. There's tall doctors, short doctors. It doesn't matter. You don't have to be the tallest guy to play the sport of basketball, football or whatever you want to play.","I'm going to be me, regardless of anything.","Guys back in the day, we didn't have wallets. I never kept my money in my pocket; my money always went in my sock. My key my mom gave me, I put it in my sock - whatever it was.","My mom is probably the only person shorter than me that I'm scared of. Still to this day. She's, like, five-two, maybe.","I've got the best shoe guy in the business.","My least favorite subject? Uh... I didn't have a least favorite subject because, I mean, high school is so much fun.","Fans are awesome.","Nobody really doubted me playing football, making it to the NFL. I was like, 'I know I can do that.'","I ran track for my school. I played football, but I didn't play for my high school; I played for a little league team.","I don't like one-foot jumpers like LeBron James. It looks better jumping off two feet. Every time Michael Jordan jumped off two feet, it looked so much better.","I always wanted to play with Kobe Bryant. I used to tease him all the time. Every time I was a free agent, I was like, 'What's up, bro? You got a chance to get the pit that you need. You feel me? This is your chance.'","The NBA is all politics. It's about who you know.","Mike D'Antoni was a cool coach, but he was just a bad person. He can coach. He was just mean for no reason.","As a kid growing up, I wanted the Allen Iverson shoes that came out, the Questions. My dad got them for me, so I was excited about that.","I am a diehard Seahawks fan because I'm born and raised in Seattle.","I love for the crowd to feed off me, and I try to make my teammates feed off me.","Actually, I'm 5-8 and change without shoes. With shoes, 5-9.","I love basketball, but I miss football every time I watch it.","There's so many kids in the world who are told, 'You can't do this, you can't do that.' Those are all put-downs. I'm all about pick-ups. You have to pick people up and pay it forward.","We're a competitive family - we compete in everything we do: playing cards; if we're walking down the street, we want to be the first one down the block.","When I was younger, I was a bit of a feisty fighter type of guy. That's something my father told me as I was becoming a man: 'You don't go picking fights, but you don't run from any of them.' And I was more afraid of my father than anybody else I had to fight.","I've seen my mother struggling, everything that she did to raise me and my brothers and my sisters, and I know the anger that she went through."],"Nate Ruess":["I kind of like being depressed.","I don't play an instrument - I just write in my head, and I usually hear fully formed songs. 'We Are Young' turned out so much like it was in my head. But it also exceeded all my expectations.","I think any branding for me is band-related. It's really weird to get used to the exposure, because I am a naturally introverted person, and I'm not exactly social. Occasionally I can get comfortable enough to talk, but I spend a lot of my days not talking, especially when I'm at home and not on tour.","Van Morrison is probably, at this point in time, my biggest influence as a vocalist. When we were making our last album I had a vinyl copy of 'Veedon Fleece' in the vocal booth in front of me, in the dorky sense. I think there were candles around, which is really tacky, but hey, I needed to channel Van the Man!","I think it's really cool, but Jimmy Eat World and Gin Blossoms did it better than anyone. People don't realize just how awesome the Arizona history is, especially for alternative music. Growing up, that's all I ever wanted to be was those two bands.","I knew how touring was for 10 years, but it's completely different now that things are popping off.","I picked up 'The Hunger Games' thinking it was written at my regressed reading level. I've spent hours reading it, and I'm not even halfway through. Our bass player, whose name is also Nate, ended up reading all three novels and loved them.","Lately I've been falling asleep listening to 'Common One' by Van Morrison, specifically the song 'Summertime in England.' It's 15 minutes long, so to make it through the entire song is a real task unto itself, but Van has that emotional payoff that makes even his most tiresome songs more powerful than most people's entire catalog.","I don't have a Twitter or a Facebook, but that doesn't mean I'm any more productive than the rest of the world.","My girlfriend is a fashion designer. She has her own company called Rachel Antonoff. She is doing a collaboration with Urban Outfitters right now, a shoe collaboration with Bass. She sells to Barneys, stuff like that.","Well, the crazy thing for me is I think out of anything that's happened in the last year, all the success, people always ask what do you guys do with the money? I don't think they realize we're not really making any money.","It's the coolest part about writing music. I don't know how other people work, but so much is derived from some amalgamation of all these different songs that I love. That's why they jump all over the place.","The Queen and Electric Light Orchestra harmonies are so distinct and fit in our songs so well sometimes, but we don't know how to do them properly.","My dad dragged me to a Bruce Springsteen concert as a kid. It was my first concert, but I fell asleep in the middle. My second concert was Weezer on the 'Pinkerton' tour, and 'Pinkerton' is the reason why I'm doing this.","In a city like New York, any night can be completely different, even in a subtle way.","A lot of times when I'm writing lyrics, I just think about insecurities that I might have and turn them into a scene. Some things may be true, and some things may not.","Running in Central Park is my favorite thing to wake up and do. I have my own specific path that I have to run every single time. There's a little bit of OCD involved, but I love it.","I prefer to connect with fans from the stage. Like, I don't have a Twitter page, or anything like that. So for me, that's what the show is about. For me - is a way to interact with fans; being up onstage and showing them, through music - which is all I really know - the best way to say thank you.","I was signed at 19 years old to a major label, and dropped by the time I was 22.","I always wanted to be a singer, but none of my friends thought I could sing.","If you can make the song a soundtrack to what you're living at the time, I think that's the most important part of a song.","I don't want to be known for anything other than writing songs.","We have this really retro vibe and style of songwriting and, personally, I wasn't embracing the current state of music until I fell in love with hip-hop. It felt good to suddenly embrace where music was headed, and I think hip-hop is the best at that, because it feels so progressive and everybody wants to be the best.","We love a good, hyped sound, but when it starts to sound insincere, that's when I lose interest. I hope that our music, even if it sounds polished, doesn't sound insincere.","Lyrics have become so dumbed down nowadays. People don't want to have to think about lyrics anymore, they just want to be told something. Until these great things started happening with us, I'd really given up on reaching people like that.","Lyrics are so important, I hate every second of writing them, but it's something I take great pride in when it's finished.","I feel like the rap metal at the end of the 1990s destroyed rock music for everybody and suddenly everybody felt like they had to apologise for being in rock bands. People suddenly felt bad about wanting to reach massive audiences and the sense of theatre, that we have in our live show, became something to avoid.","I idolised bands like Pearl Jam and Smashing Pumpkins, who wanted to reach as many people as they could.","I came from somewhat of a musical family. I had an uncle on Broadway. My dad kind of knows how to play instruments. Although, I always find it annoying when he does play an instrument.","I think that I always thought that if my uncle was on Broadway, then I must inherently have a good voice. I don't think that for a while I did. Eventually, out of sheer will of never wanting to get a job or go to college, I found my way into doing music full-time.","Even now, when I try and think of band names just randomly, I'm so thankful that 'fun.' is the name of the band. I never really think twice about it. It is so simple and so easy.","I think legally we have to do 'fun' with a period. I think we agreed because apparently there was another band called 'fun.' We Google-searched, which now makes sense because we're so impossible to Google-search.","It's important that I get time to run, to just go for a jog for about 30 minutes. It helps with my voice, but it also kind of gives me a little bit of time to myself - and you get to see a city.","I try and get about eight hours of sleep every single night. And I like to think that I drink more water than anyone, ever.","I was in a really crummy pop-punk band. I think we did a whole bunch of Blink-182 covers, and we were on the fringe of losers and jocks. So we invited all the cool kids to come watch us play in our bass player's brother's bedroom. And it was terrible, but everyone thought we were so cool.","My parents had normal jobs, and I didn't just want to work all day, and so I thought if I could break into music I wouldn't have to work all day. And I had an uncle who was on Broadway, so I was like, 'I have to be able to sing.'","I'm not going to lie. I check the iTunes charts. It's all about the iTunes charts. I only go on the Internet for the iTunes charts and basketball blogs.","I worry that if I enjoy something - like the songs on 'Some Nights' are about wondering about who you are. I'm never quite sure and I'd hate to feel sort of content and get a good sense of who I am because if I know one thing, that's not me. I don't mind not necessarily being happy about it. And that's fine.","As a songwriter I hate this whole, 'If it's a sad song, it has to sound like a sad song thing.' And that goes all the way back to my days with the Format. I'm an insane narcissist, so if I have to get something off my chest, I'll get something off my chest.","We grew up listening to alternative music from the '90s, and there was no shame in being on a major label and still making the music you wanted to make. I feel like rap rock came around and drew a line in the sand, and everybody that was like me ran away from that and started making indie-rock.","But as long as you're creating the art you want to create, if people start liking you, you shouldn't have to apologize. You want your stuff to be heard by as many people as possible.","If you look at a lot of the songs I've been involved in, there's always been this retro vibe. I started getting worried that I wasn't moving forward very much, nor was I even in tune with the music today. I almost scoffed at it."],"Nate Silver":["By playing games you can artificially speed up your learning curve to develop the right kind of thought processes.","We must become more comfortable with probability and uncertainty.","First of all, I think it's odd that people who cover politics wouldn't have any political views.","People don't have a good intuitive sense of how to weigh new information in light of what they already know. They tend to overrate it.","Almost everyone's instinct is to be overconfident and read way too much into a hot or cold streak.","The key to making a good forecast is not in limiting yourself to quantitative information.","When human judgment and big data intersect there are some funny things that happen.","You get steely nerves playing poker.","The Protestant Reformation had a lot to do with the printing press, where Martin Luther's theses were reproduced about 250,000 times, and so you had widespread dissemination of ideas that hadn't circulated in the mainstream before.","When you get into statistical analysis, you don't really expect to achieve fame. Or to become an Internet meme. Or be parodied by 'The Onion' - or be the subject of a cartoon in 'The New Yorker.' I guess I'm kind of an outlier there.","Basically, books were a luxury item before the printing press.","Distinguishing the signal from the noise requires both scientific knowledge and self-knowledge.","There's always the risk that there are unknown unknowns.","Every day, three times per second, we produce the equivalent of the amount of data that the Library of Congress has in its entire print collection, right? But most of it is like cat videos on YouTube or 13-year-olds exchanging text messages about the next Twilight movie.","You don't want to influence the same system you are trying to forecast.","To the extent that you can find ways where you're making predictions, there's no substitute for testing yourself on real-world situations that you don't know the answer to in advance.","I have the same friends and the same bad habits.","I'm not trying to do anything too tricky.","We're living in a world where Google beats Gallup.","We want to get 80%-85% of predictions right, not 100%. Or else we calibrated our estimates in the wrong way.","If you have reason to think that yesterday's forecast went wrong, there is no glory in sticking to it.","Well, you know, you're not going to have 86 percent of Congress voted out of office.","Remember, the Congress doesn't get as many opportunities to make an impression with the public.","If there's a major foreign policy event, the President gets on TV, the Congress doesn't.","A lot of journalism wants to have what they call objectivity without them having a commitment to pursuing the truth, but that doesn't work. Objectivity requires belief in and a commitment toward pursuing the truth - having an object outside of our personal point of view.","I think punditry serves no purpose.","I guess I don't like the people in politics very much, to be blunt.","Any one game in baseball doesn't tell you that much, just as any one poll doesn't tell you that much.","In baseball you have terrific data and you can be a lot more creative with it.","The problem is that when polls are wrong, they tend to be wrong in the same direction. If they miss in New Hampshire, for instance, they all miss on the same mistake.","Race is still the No. 1 determinant in every election.","I don't think that somebody who is observing or predicting behavior should also be participating in the 'experiment.'","Midterm elections can be dreadfully boring, unfortunately.","I think there's space in the market for a half-dozen kind of polling analysts.","All I know is that I have way more stuff that I want to write about than I possibly have time to.","I view my role now as providing more of a macro-level skepticism, rather than saying this poll is good or this poll is evil.","The public is even more pessimistic about the economy than even the most bearish economists are.","To be a very, very minor, eighth-tier celebrity, you realize, 'Hey, celebrities are just like us.'","Success makes you less intimidated by things.","People attach too much importance to intangibles like heart, desire and clutch hitting.","If I had a spreadsheet on my computer, it looked like I was busy.","When you try to predict future E.R.A.'s with past E.R.A.'s, you're making a mistake.","Walk rate is probably the area in which a pitcher has the most room to improve, but a rate that high is tough to overcome.","I have to make sure that I make good choices and that if I put my name on it, it's a high-quality endeavor and that I have time to be a human being.","I have to think about how to not spread myself too thin. It's a really great problem to have.","I love South American food, and I haven't really been down there. I really need a vacation.","Actually, one of the better indicators historically of how well the stock market will do is just a Gallup poll, when you ask Americans if you think it's a good time to invest in stocks, except it goes the opposite direction of what you would expect. When the markets going up, it in fact makes it more prone toward decline.","Well the way we perceive accuracy and what accuracy is statistically are really two different things.","In politics people build whole reputations off of getting one thing right.","People still don't appreciate how ephemeral success is.","I've become invested with this symbolic power. It really does transcend what I'm actually doing and what I actually deserve.","You don't want to treat any one person as oracular.","I've just always been a bit of a dork.","I was looking for something like baseball, where there's a lot of data and the competition was pretty low. That's when I discovered politics.","Caesar recognized the omens, but he didn't believe they applied to him.","People gravitate toward information that implies a happier outlook for them.","I don't think you should limit what you read.","If you're keeping yourself in the bubble and only looking at your own data or only watching the TV that fits your agenda then it gets boring.","Every four years in the presidential election, some new precedent is broken.","I don't play fantasy baseball anymore now because it's too much work, and I feel like I have to hold myself up to such a high standard. I'm pretty serious about my fantasy football, though.","We're not that much smarter than we used to be, even though we have much more information - and that means the real skill now is learning how to pick out the useful information from all this noise.","You can build a statistical model and that's all well and good, but if you're dealing with a new type of financial instrument, for example, or a new type of situation - then the choices you're making are pretty arbitrary in a lot of respects.","I actually buy the paper version of The New York Times maybe once or twice a week.","If you aren't taking a representative sample, you won't get a representative snapshot.","We are living our lives more online and you need to have different ways to capture that.","A lot of things can't be modeled very well.","Voters memories will fade some.","It's a little strange to become a kind of symbol of a whole type of analysis.","A lot of news is just entertainment masquerading as news.","A lot of the time nothing happens in a day.","I'm a pro-horserace guy.","On average, people should be more skeptical when they see numbers. They should be more willing to play around with the data themselves.","I think people feel like there are all these things in our lives that we don't really have control over.","Whenever you have dynamic interactions between 300 million people and the American economy acting in really complex ways, that introduces a degree of almost chaos theory to the system, in a literal sense.","I think a lot of journal articles should really be blogs.","The thing that people associate with expertise, authoritativeness, kind of with a capital 'A,' don't correlate very well with who's actually good at making predictions.","I prefer more to kind of show people different things than tell them 'oh, here's what you should believe' and, over time, you can build up a rapport with your audience."],"Nate Torrence":["I feel like I was in the last graduating class of commercial actors.","Even through 'Get Smart' or 'She's Out of My League,' I have yet to have that instant recognition and at such an early stage, where people totally didn't know my name, but they knew my face immediately.","People weren't willing to bet on 'The Commercial Guy' when they were casting movies and television in the beginning, but I stuck around, and now it's slowly starting to pay off.","I'd say specifically after 'Get Smart,' people now know me either as The Guy from 'Get Smart' or 'She's Out of My League.' When that came out on DVD, everyone was recognizing me from that.","I had never heard of Cingular, but they needed people to jump on trampolines. Well, when I was 13, I was a trampoline gymnast. I had actually won nationals in my age group. So it was like one of those perfect, unbelievable miracles.","I married my high school sweetheart, and I do have two kids.","I specifically had my son wear a Browns jersey on the streets of Pittsburgh while we were there.","To be honest, I've just become a Steelers fan.","I loved my start. I'm proud of my spots. I don't feel embarrassed by anything that I did... It definitely helped me more than hurt me.","I feel like I was in the last graduating class of commercial actors. TiVo! I was out there before TiVo came out, man.","I'd say, specifically after 'Get Smart,' people now know me either as The Guy from 'Get Smart' or 'She's Out of My League'; when that came out on DVD, everyone was recognizing me from that. But as far as the amount of people in a time, nothing touches when those Capital One commercials were playing."],"Nathalie Emmanuel":["I'm a bit of a 'Throny,' as I think the 'Game of Thrones' fans refer to themselves.","With 'Game of Thrones,' there are no real limitations.","I have been challenged with the fictional languages I have to learn. I wasn't terrible at languages at school - I got an A in French, so I did well enough - but I didn't enjoy them. I'm not even sure if that plays into how well you learn a fictional language!","I was a huge fan of 'Game Of Thrones.' I hadn't read the books but had watched the series from the beginning.","I would love to do more work in the States, but I like working at home in the U.K., so to work here and there would be the plan.","I didn't go to drama school, so I feel like I did all my growing up on 'Hollyoaks.'"],"Nathalie Kelley":["I'm such a girl because all the guys go for cars because of their engines or something like that.

Imagine Shakespeare being aware of the Oedipal complex when he wrote Hamlet. It would have been a disaster.","One can't write for all readers. A poet cannot write for people who don't like poetry.","One can't write without having read - you have to read before beginning to write - and universities offer a very good opportunity to read.","The act of writing is a kind of catharsis, a liberation, but I never really concerned myself with that. I write because it interests me.","Women have seen that they have locked themselves up with feminist writing.","All psychological research is completely barred by the interpretations of the psychoanalysts. Everything happens in the unconscious, and I don't know what this unconscious is.","The reader has to be creative when he's reading. He has to try to make the thing alive.

Airbnb is not a perfect substitute for a hotel. We excel at different things.","I'm married. I have a daughter, so I put aside time in the day to spend with them.","My wife and I try to have a date night once a week. We schedule them all in advance.","I don't feel like my life happens to me. I feel like I happen to my life. I feel that I'm in the driver's seat.","I don't like asking people for things, so if I can do it myself, that's the mindset I have. My dad is very much a do-it-yourself kind of person, so I had a strong sense of independence.","Airbnb is creating a new marketplace for space and is facing many of the challenges that eBay faced back in 1998 when they created a new marketplace for goods.","With commerce comes fraud.","Deviants from around the world are trying to 'beat' our system every day. We have to proactively identify suspicious behavior and quarantine users until additional verification steps can be taken.","We don't want to go starting completely separate businesses that do nothing for our user base.","When we founded Airbnb in 2008, our dream was to help create a world where you could belong anywhere, and that vision has taken root in almost every country in the world.","We want to strike the right balance between the governments and our users. If there are concerns, we can work together.","I had this question when we started: Is this something that's only going to work in New York City? And then, is it just in North America? Is it just in Western culture?","When you think about it, Airbnb is a great solution if your family is traveling with you on business and you need more space, if you're going for an extended stay, like a week plus. It's a great solution if you want close proximity to the work site and maybe there isn't a hotel across the street or whatnot.","Historically, we've just been doing accommodation. And, going forward, we're really exploring the full boundaries of everything that someone needs while on a trip, and also how can we reinvent that experience.","I actually almost made a million dollars while in high school.","Silicon Valley is super competitive and super expensive for talent, for office space, for everything.","We have to be careful that we don't have so much regulation that would prevent all of the people who are benefiting from Airbnb to benefit.","Ultimately, what we're trying to do for our customers or our guests is create magical travel experiences.","I don't like spending money.","I like to keep things simple.","I have incredible wealth, and I think there's a great responsibility to use this position to do good stuff.","I realized that I'm increasingly in a position where I know a network of people, and I'm able to connect more or less anyone.","Talking to hosts and asking them, 'What does Airbnb mean to you?'...

One that really celebrates the different places, different cultures, the different cities and immerses you in that culture.","I think we've always thought that it's important to have a positive relationships with local government rather than taking a confrontational kind of stance.","Some hotels are trying to dig their feet in and trying to say that Airbnb shouldn't exist - that 'illegal hotels' shouldn't exist. And, of course, illegal hotels shouldn't exist. But when they say illegal hotels, sometimes they mean anything that's not a hotel.","When you offer consumers choice, let them vote with their wallets.","What we've demonstrated is there's an immense appetite to travel more authentically and immerse yourself in culture... as opposed to having a commoditised experience.","Airbnb is dedicated to empowering people and communities through healthy tourism, and we have a long tradition of supporting local projects in Asia-Pacific.","Airbnb is built on the foundation of creating community through belonging, and we're honored to stand with a bipartisan group of mayors and businesses from across the country dedicated to improving communities by addressing affordable housing and homelessness.","Part of being an entrepreneur is, like, it's just so great to run your own business, that feeling you get.","There's a perception out there that Airbnb doesn't want there to be rules. We think rules would be fantastic. We think rules would help our community, but not necessarily the rules that have simply existed for decades.","It's not just exciting to build things but to explore new fields and to recognize what comes with that is a lot of uncertainty.","We make every one of our users sign a pledge when they sign up that they will not discriminate, that they will not exhibit hatred.

I also love sushi and Japanese food. Food is my favorite in general.","I can't decide the results, but I can still put my best foot forward and try the best I can.","I have confidence in how I've trained and prepared myself. I've dreamed about the Olympics for a long time, and it would be kind of silly and a waste to freak myself out.","There's always things that I can improve on.","I love skating. It's part of my life, and I never wanted to give it up.","I celebrate my hardworking parents and all the opportunities they gave me.","These big jumps take a big toll on the body, especially a young body. So, it's kind of risk or reward, I guess.","From a logistical standpoint, I learned about when to peak, when to push, when to recover throughout the season.","Largely, I began skating because I wanted stuff to do outside of school. My mom decided to put me into figure skating.","Regardless of what I do, no matter how good it is, it's never, in my mind, 'flawless.'","Really, I'm just a normal kid.","I want to be a full-package skater.","My parents did not come to the U.S. with much; they had a lot of hardship.","We were all just taught to work as hard as we could, use these opportunities to advance, and just really appreciate all that we had.","I've skated after Yuzu a handful of times. The only thing I can take away from it is to be prepared for the Pooh-bears to be raining down from the audience.","Ever since I started skating, making the Olympic team was my ultimate dream. It's what has inspired and motivated me throughout my entire career.","Netflix isn't available internationally all the time, but the NBA is. It's nice to have something that feels like home.","As a kid growing up, I didn't want to tell any of my classmates I did figure-skating because I knew they'd be like, 'Oh, you're a skater, you're gay, blah blah blah.' So I kept it to myself. Once I started getting to more of an elite level, I didn't really care what people thought, though.","I have my own life to live.","It's been a dream of mine to be selected on the U.S. Olympic team as long as I can remember.","The Olympics have really motivated me, ever since I started skating as a little kid.","I have a very close family. I have four older siblings: two brothers and two sisters.","My family and parents were very influential in my skating career.","I am a first-generation American of Chinese decent. My parents were both born and raised in China and moved to the U.S. in their 20s.","My parents always enforce the idea of never giving up upon all of my siblings and me, and I think that's something that will stick with me my whole life.","You have to have passion for what you do, or else it's difficult when the going gets tough.","Like my parents taught me, never give up, and always love what you do.","My Chinese name is Chen Wei. I can speak a tiny, tiny bit, just basically get around, but I understand it decently well.","In terms of, like, interviews, I used to struggle a lot with interviews; I never knew what to say.","I tend to be a little bit more quiet and just to myself. I'm a little bit more introverted than extroverted.","It's like you get a high off the jumps, and you crave it, and you want to do it again and again and again.","I genuinely dislike sequins.","I like biology a lot.","I always carry my phone with me. I always have a computer on me.","I really enjoy traveling to... I went to Spain. That was really cool. Japan was really cool. France was really cool.","I want to do something in medicine, for sure. I don't know what, exactly, that entails, but something along those lines.","Team U.S.A. is awesome.","I try to get as close to 10 hours of sleep each night, as sleep is the best form of recovery.","I do very scientific-based training. However, for skating, that's a little bit out of the ordinary. Many skaters base their off-ice training around plyometrics, whereas mine is very strength- and power-based.","I really like to bike outdoors and love the weight-based workouts that I do. I am not the biggest fan of other cardio-based workouts. Off-season cardio sessions are pretty grueling.","I think doing a quint is very, very difficult.","That would be pretty cool being the first one to do the quint.","I never got to go to prom or homecoming or a lot of the typical teenage stuff. But, if you think about it, I've gotten to go and meet different people and travel all over the world.","As a family, we are all intrinsically motivated.","My parents always wanted the very best for me and pushed me further and further, so that stuck with me.","There are always benefits and good things, bad things that come out of every performance.","Skating in itself is a difficult sport, and the amazing athletes within the sport are very challenging.","I would love to be working in a hospital or in a completely different realm, working with or exploring the lives of animals.","I am proud to be a first-generation Chinese-American in the sport of figure skating.","I start in the morning with something like a breakfast burrito and a smoothie, something that gives me enough protein and carbs to start my day.","Throughout the day, I'll snack a lot. I always have some breakfast cereal, like Kellogg's cereal, something on hand, so that I can just quickly get some carbs in.","Emma Watson definitely is my celebrity crush. I love 'Harry Potter.' Plus, she's gorgeous, which really helps.","I hate spiders; I'm terrified of spiders.","Maybe it's innate: I have a body built to jump.","There's a lot of skaters that I look up to, and I think my biggest skating role models were the two Russian competitors at the 2002 Olympic games in Salt Lake City. They really motivated me to follow my passion in skating, and it really blossomed from there.","Ever since I was a younger skater, I've been working my way to these big jumps.","Once you land a jump, you put it straight in the program. That's the way I've always been doing it.","Once I landed the triple Salchow, I put it in the program. First landed triple toe, straight into the program. That's what I did with my quad suite.","Honestly, I am human. I make mistakes.","I just like to keep pushing myself and the sport.","I want to get another Olympic medal outside the team event.","It's something I have to remind myself about, that at every competition, I put a lot of pressure on myself, almost like it's the end of the world, and I have to keep reminding myself it's not.","Sometimes thinking about the Olympics makes me a little nervous.","My skating career won't last forever.","That's something I'm actually very interested in doing, helping young skaters.","I like the challenge and instant gratification of landing a new jump or learning a new element. That made me fall in love with the sport.","Being able to land all the quads, especially doing them all in one program, is mentally huge.","Half of learning a new element is just getting over the fear of doing it. Once you mentally prepare yourself enough to do the jump, that is really half the battle.","Just being here at the Olympics is pretty incredible in itself. Seeing the unity of the athletes and to see how everyone has worked so hard to get here - and we are all so excited to be here - it's awesome to be able to experience it.","A lot of the things I do outside the rink are just to relax and recover. We spend so much time at the rink, so it's nice to decompress a little.","An artistic standpoint - I've watched a lot of ballet and source some inspiration from how they move, connect with each other, and find meaning in their movement.","There are always times when you don't want to go to the rink, or you don't want to do all the things you're supposed to do. Sometimes you're exhausted, or it's been a long week, but I always remind myself that this is my Olympic dream and the passion, because I love the sport very much.","It's reassuring knowing that people are supporting me and want to know more about me. It comes with being the national champion and making the Olympic team. I think that it's telling me I'm on the right path.","Skating is a sport that I found a lot of interest in from a very, very young age. Ultimately, I think that being on the ice, being in the cold, and trying things and challenging myself in different ways is something that made me really interested in skating.","I began skating when I was 3. It was during 2002, the year the Olympics were held in Salt Lake City.","I began skating in the official practice venue of the 2002 Games. It was a huge Olympic atmosphere with Apollo Ohno sitting on the wall every day when I walked into the rink. That was really cool and very inspiring to see.","Triples are hard. Triple axel is just not my jump. Quads are really my thing.","The Olympics really started motivating me from the very start. That was my dream from the very beginning.","Once I really understood what skating was and what the Olympic really entailed, I knew that's what I wanted to do: I wanted to be there; I wanted to represent the U.S.","Personally, I feel like there should be some sort of cap on the quads, but we should still be pushing it to a certain number.","I wanted to be a goalie.","I don't think the demographic for skating really entails a lot of basketball watching.","If the jump is perfect, you come out, and you feel like you took a three-pointer in basketball or doing the perfect thing in whatever your sport is. You just get that adrenaline rush, a sense of satisfaction, like you want to do it again and again.","I've been working on it a lot, trying to find the artistic balance, trying to find purpose in my movement combined with the jumps.","To have all of these jumps in my arsenal is very beneficial. I can always alter my program so I can either play it safe, or I can play it risky with high reward. It depends on what I feel like I need that day.","I think my parents felt us being a minority a little bit more than I did, and they tried to shelter me from that so I didn't feel it at all.","I'm the baby for sure. My siblings are looking out for me, making sure I'm not doing something stupid. They are making sure my head is set straight and that I'm a good person outside of skating and inside of it, too.","When I watch my skating when I was younger, I definitely see all this balletic movement and this artistry come through.","I love jumping. I have always loved jumping. I love watching jumps. I love doing jumps.","Skating is a very beautiful sport, and I love watching new programs.","Every competition is different... You can't plan for everything that happens.","My training and ballet background definitely gives me the competitive edge on the ice.","I think that ballet and skating definitely go hand in hand, especially growing up at Ballet West, which is an incredible academy.","I've always had Russian coaches.","I really wanted to play hockey. My mom thought figure skates looked easier to use, so she put me in the learn-to-skate program."],"Nathan Deal":["While advances in scientific research have led to some new and exciting treatments that have enlarged and enhanced the quality and length of human life, we must not lose sight as to what we are trying to accomplish.","Consider this: I can go to Antarctica and get cash from an ATM without a glitch, but should I fall ill during my travels, a hospital there could not access my medical records or know what medications I am on.","Nurses are an integral component of the health care system, and it is important that we recognize the over 2.7 million registered nurses for the significant work that they do.","What is fetus farming? Simply put, it is the creation and development of a human fetus for the purposes of later killing it for research or for harvesting its organs.","Using adult stem cells drawn from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood system cells, scientists have discovered new treatments for scores of diseases and conditions such as Parkinson's disease, juvenile diabetes, and spinal cord injuries.","For the last 3 years, we have celebrated National Nurses Week. Beginning on May 6, we will once again have the opportunity to truly commend the nursing community for their contributions to our national health delivery system.","If a State has reliable scientific information that demonstrates that a warning is needed for a particular food, then in the interest of public health, it should share that information with the FDA and petition for a new national standard.","With scientific advances, Congress must now make changes to reflect new therapeutic options.","We have created a new demonstration program to allow families with a sick child who could be helped with a cord blood transplant from a sibling to bank cord blood from newborns should they decide to have another child.","The Center for Immigration Studies found that illegal immigrants cost the United States taxpayer about $10.4 billion a year. A large part of that expense stems from the babies born each year to illegal immigrants.","Scientific advancement should aim to affirm and to improve human life.","Science without respect for human life is degrading to us all and reflects a hollow and deceptive philosophy, a philosophy that we as a people should never condone.","Pluripotent cells have the ability to grow into any cell in the body.","On the other hand, the vast majority of all westernized countries, including every single European country along with Israel and Japan, do not offer birthright citizenship.","Just because scientists have the knowledge to do it, the technology to do it, and some may even have a financial motive or other incentive to do it, does not make it right.","In his 4 years in the White House, President Carter worked to make the Federal Government more competent and compassionate and more responsive to the American people.","In fact, many nations currently refuse to support embryonic stem cell research of any kind.","Every year, nearly two-thirds of the approximately 200,000 patients in need of a bone marrow transplant will not find a marrow donor that matches within their families.","Cord blood stem cell units have been shown to be a suitable alternative to adult bone marrow for the treatment of many diseases, including sickle cell anemia.","Births to illegal immigrants now account for nearly one out of every ten births in the United States.","As a physician, I know many doctors want to utilize new technology, but they find the cost prohibitive."],"Nathan Englander":["I'm very interested in how people change.","I'm just very interested, fascinated, heartbroken, obsessed with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and our need to find peace on that front... Everyone's always, like, victim and avenger at the same time.","What I'm trying to say is that a lot that lies behind being able to live the writing life is psychological and wrapped up in ideas of self-definition.","I am a fifth-generation American, but from a young age, I went to yeshiva. I spent 12 hours a day with rabbis, and I think in Yiddish. To this day, I have to go back and unravel my writing and polish it so everyone doesn't sound like an old Jewish woman.","I think in circles; I speak in circles. I unravel my thoughts that way.","There's an Armed Forces Haggadah and an Alcoholics Anonymous Haggadah and an LGBT Haggadah. Some people make a new Haggadah every year. It's a real living document... They're just constantly made throughout time.","As someone who spent a lot of years living in Jerusalem, one of the great perks is that when you come back, and you get into these Israel arguments in your American-Jewish clan, you can really just silence them by saying, 'I lived there.' So we used it like a bludgeon.","When you're in a world, and your parents are one way, and you're told, 'This is how the whole world is, and this is how you're supposed to be,' and you're terribly unhappy in that world, it's a very scary thing.","My mother raised me very clearly that if you cross the street, you will die. If you go outside, you will die. If you play sports, you will likely die. That's what I was getting at home.","For a book to function... it has to be a functioning reality. The character has to be real, and I imagine that's exactly what happens for a spy who is in deep cover.","So many people discuss, you know, Israel/Palestine as if it's people on a spectrum.","I'm kind of in love with my theater agent. I'm a true naive about the theater, a total innocent.","There's no safety in anything, but in the arts, there is really this idea of no promises. I didn't follow the writing dream for safety.","I feel very lucky that I have this career that allows me to say, 'I'm ready to start now on this project,' and I can go and do it.","Human experience is infinite. Lives are infinite. Stories are infinite. Just because one story has gravity in it doesn't mean you can't write a different one with gravity in it.","I hardly grew up mono-lingually! I was raised religious, so there's a tradition of semi-access to a second language. When I learned my ABCs, they taught us our Aleph-Bet at the same time.","I think my love for rhythm in language comes from repeating the same words, the same sounds, over and over again day after day for so many years.","When you see 'editor' on a book, there are many permutations of what that title can mean.","Sometimes I feel like those born-again folk, always working on their faith, but I'm always working on my atheism. We all have our struggles.","I'd chosen to dedicate my life to writing, and I asked myself, 'if you write your whole life, and nobody ever sees a word, is it as a writer that you die?'","It's so easy to call something a Jewish story or a gay story or a woman's story. Aesthetically, if a story is not universal, it has failed. Your obligation is to the story. One rule creatively, and emotionally, is its universality.","When I wrote my novel, 'The Ministry of Special Cases,' I couldn't even brush my teeth. I had to write in isolation from everything else. I thought a play would take away from my fiction, but the more projects I work on, the more time I have.","I don't think it's the writer's job to give answers or to give opinions. In fact, when a writer has answers, I think the work ends up being corrupted. It becomes didactic. What a book does is share a consciousness and invite people to explore the questions as best as you can.","Every book is vulnerable, and every book is nerve-wracking, but I've never been both so excited and terrified to have a book coming into the world. It's an expressly loaded subject, one on which you can't win.","The reason people get afraid of writing real, honest journalism and fiction, and the reason corrupted people and demagogues are afraid of journalism and fiction and poetry across the world, is because it is a subversive form.","Everything is so much clearer once a world is framed. Maybe it sounds crazy, but with writing, it's infinity that is limiting and the limited that allows for the truly infinite. Once all those elements are in place in a story, the brain is truly freed up to imagine without end.","So writing stories is not easier in comparison to the playwriting or translation; the stories are easier in league with them.","Palestine isn't a state when it concerns statehood. When it comes to warring, it's a state, yes? The Palestinians, they live in a country, for the purpose of war.","I always call myself either an optimistic pessimist or a pessimistic optimist - I'm not sure which way it goes.","Your brain forms a story and, if you're lucky, there's a line where the story takes over the brain. You don't even know what you have.","There was a terrible fear for me when I started writing, which was that if you'd been denied unbelievably tumultuous experience, you didn't have permission to write.","I wrote a novel, so now they can call me a novelist. I tell stories; that's it.","I spent my whole childhood being told, 'Israel is surrounded by enemies who are trying to push it into the sea.' But can't Gaza feel the same way? Personally, I'm frozen in time.","I love those books and movies where someone turns because they're blackmailed or they're passed over for promotion.","Philip Roth has been a huge influence on me. The early books I read in my teens and twenties.","I didn't sleep the night I finished 'Sister Hills.' It was so unsettling. I felt really wild. I didn't have a clue. It's a very loaded subject, and I did not know what I had. I was interested in watching how choices unfold over time. It's a story that's raising questions.","I was resistant to the Internet. I was afraid of it.","Twitter is the best art for writers. I find it enticing.","There was a summer in college where I worked for a stretch picking up garbage at the beach. On the early shift, it was very meditative walking the shoreline and crisscrossing the sand, picking up the junk people had dropped or tossed or that the ocean had returned. And there was this strange fantasy element to it.","When I was living in Jerusalem, I used to write in a coffee shop called Tmol Shilshom. I'd sit at the same table every day and work. And right next to my seat was a weathered wingback chair by a window.","I'd say that in place of a singular phobic-level terror, I keep a whole collection of running, yet manageable, fears.","I lived in Jerusalem with the Temple Mount as my holy site. My Palestinian neighbors lived in Al-Quds with the Haram al-Sharif.","I know nobody believes in peace anymore, but what else is there to work toward? As the years have gone by, peace seems like more and more of an impossibility.","I moved to New York because I thrive there.","Whatever part of writing that is subconscious is a thing that no one has access to.","Empathy is what obsesses me. And watching empathy recede in the world is terrifying.","With each book, I've found myself more and more able to draw off the personal and still be as vulnerable as I need to be as a writer.","I understand if everyone looking at me is seeing a Jew and seeing me as a kind of 'other.' But I can't be expected to see myself that way. That is, to me, Jewish is the normal way to be; it's not a type of being.","You spend so much time as a writer telling straight and linear stories.","Every nation should wrestle with the question of what it means to defend itself, what it means to take revenge.","There's no such thing as being a cultural Jew. You're religious or you're not.","Yes, there is a way I was taught to think that's very suited to writing. And, of course, I'm thankful to have grown up in a world filled with stories."],"Nathan Fielder":["I loved theatre and did magic, too, but I was never the best at it - there was never a teacher saying, 'You're great, you have to make this your career!' I was good at science and math. I figured I'd go into science and become a dentist.","I used to trade stocks online, and I kind of felt gross, like, all I'm doing is making money off other people's creativity, and I'm not creating anything myself.","In life, a lot of great ideas sound insane or absurd at first.","A lot of the time, people think I'm really dumb or really uncomfortable talking to them, which is kind of a real thing.","It's much funnier when the comedy can happen with me just trying my best to genuinely do a good thing.","Social interactions have always been a bit of a difficult thing for me. I think I have a natural tendency to make people not 100 percent super comfortable.","I just don't have this magnetic personality that everyone is drawn to. I don't make friends easily... I'm just not one of those people.","I'm not into things that feel like a sequel. There's just something magical about when something happens for the first time.","It's weird. I don't really have goals. I just try to make sure I'm enjoying what I'm doing. Once I start to get sick of it, the next thing becomes obvious.","Once in a while, I do these things that would make the 10-year old version of me laugh. I don't know why. You've got to do something a little bit immature. I'm surprised at how often those are my best ideas.","I'm very bad at ending sentences. A lot times I just want to say, 'That's the end of my sentence. I have nothing more to say.'","I don't like getting people upset, so that's not my goal. But I like putting people in situations where how they respond says a lot about them.","The type of thing that one person would get mad at, another person would laugh at, is a good kind of zone to be in.","I have a business background. I have always wanted to open my own business.","I auditioned for 'The Office,' and I don't know if it was a role I could do, but I liked the character. You do one take, and you're reading with a person who's just sitting in a chair and not really... you're not playing off someone, which is what I like to do. I like to play around and find the moment.","Dramas make me laugh. The other day, I saw 'The Place Beyond the Pines,' and I was giggling the whole time. I laugh when I'm uncomfortable.","If I find something funny and make an older woman laugh, I love that for some reason.","I seem to get into situations that make people laugh, but I don't consider myself that funny of a person. I'm not witty. I'm kind of slow in conversations. I'm not that articulate with jokes. The first time I made stuff and screened it for an audience, I was surprised what people were laughing at."],"Nathan Fillion":["I like to say there's certain things you can't take back: One of them is 'I love you,' and one of them is bullets.","You know, Castle's the kind of guy that when he meets somebody, that's a connection for him. He remains connected to the people that he meets. That's the kind of guy he is, be they criminals, gangster rappers, mafia guys, art thieves, whoever it is, he nurtures those relationships.","It's a trap I've fallen into earlier in my career - trying to be liked. Don't do it. When I watch TV and I see someone trying to make me like them, acting cute or quirky or goofy, I'm not impressed. Don't act like America's watching you. Just latch onto your character. Characters are flawed. Be unlikeable. Be flawed. Be a person.","I'll tell you what I really enjoy. We all go to the movies, we all watch television, we know what they're about, how they work. When the main character is a cop or a spy, it's very exciting, but I also very much enjoy when the main characters are nobodies - a trucker.","When I go to a sci-fi convention, oh God, it's the closest thing to being a rock star I will ever know in this life. I want to be a rock star, don't you? It's a good thing to be, a rock star.","My brain is like a hard drive. Once you start adding new information, you start cutting off old information.","I kind of found a niche for myself after 'Firefly'. I found something that I enjoyed doing and that I did well, but as far as how I seek out a part, it's always different. It's always something that lights you on fire when you read it. It might be just one scene, it might be one line that defines the character for you.","I don't spend a lot of time online. My mother's really good at picking out if she sees a really great review, and she'll forward it to me. She's like my little Internet filter. It's always nice to see something going up; if I want to find something on Nathan Fillion, I do know where to look, but I've got a nice little delivery system in my mom.","I had a Ford F-250. It was a big ol' farm truck, but it wasn't a rig. That's about the biggest I've ever driven. That's what I drove back and forth to high school. I was a poor guy, and it was a truck that my uncle owned and let me drive because I had no money.","I'm a plethora of stolen jokes and kitschy references.","I'm comfortable only when there's a mutual attraction. That's what anyone wants. If I find out she's not attracted to me, it brings down my level of attraction to her. If I'm interested and find out she's not, I tend to cool off.","Improv as an actor makes you present in the moment. You listen, you're attentive. You're not acting so much as reacting, which is what you're doing in life all the time.","There's comedy even in tragedy. There's comedy in life. And in 'Castle', we go for that comedy.","Whatever our bedtime was as kids, we could stay up an extra half hour if we were reading. My parents didn't care as long as I was under the spell of a Stephen King or a Douglas Adams. Now I read in bed. I read at work. I read standing in line. It's like, 'Hello, my name is Nathan and I am a reader.'","I still buy actual books. The smell, having it in your hands - there's really no substitute.","I'm the biggest geek of all. Adventure, fantasy, comic books - I can't get enough.","I want my job to include a little adventure, a little more of a heightened reality than what I'm actually living. And 'Castle' has that. He gets this opportunity to tail these homicide detectives, and he's driven by that. He's a little immature, but he's obviously loving life.","You want to put out a TV show? If you have the money to do it on your own, by yourself, and you have a TV network, you can do it by yourself. But the nature of the beast is, art needs finance. That's how this industry works. So until the Internet becomes our source of entertainment - and watch it, I believe it will - this is how things go.","Being in the industry, I've seen many situations where someone will get the call from the network where they say 'You guys have 5 episodes to wrap it up.' Then all your long-term story arcs gotta get wrapped up in five episodes because that's how many episodes you got left. I would hate to see that happen to 'Castle'.","I think I've been really good at surrounding myself with really talented people. I've picked the right coattails to ride on.","I don't expect anybody to know who I am.","I love what I do. And why not be nice? I mean, I've seen people who work and they're apparently not enjoying it, and they're making sure everybody knows it.","I've got a fantastic life. I enjoy what I do for a living. I see the blessings; I'm not blind.","I've had a long line of failed television programs, pilots that were never picked up, series that didn't go very long. I've learned that there's really nothing you can do. If it's not in my control, I try not to worry about it.","Thank God there is a such thing as hiatus. We got the first 'Dr. Horrible' done in six days, we banged it out.","I consider 'Dr. Horrible' a tremendous success. The fact that it won an Emmy I just think lends validity to what we were doing and the point we were trying to make: taking the power into someone else's hands and changing the world.","You can't embarrass Joss Whedon, he's got no pride! He fully admits it. 'Oh, it's me. I'm little and goofy.' You can't wound his pride. He's too self-deprecating.","No one wants to see a person on TV who's super-ultra-cool. That's Superman, that's a thing of the past. Heroes are now flawed, and have terrible tempers, you know? They're real people.","I'm the one who often makes the 'Murder, She Wrote' reference, and ABC hates that, they don't want me to do that. And I say that having never actually watched 'Murder, She Wrote'. I think people have been trying to compare it to crime shows that are on right now, and all I can do is listen. I don't watch a lot of TV.","I tell you, 'Firefly'? Best job I ever had. Heartbroken when it was canceled, but had it not been canceled, I never would have gotten 'Serenity'. I think 'Serenity' is the most incredible thing I've ever been able to actually get my hands on and do. I can't even tell you how much love I have for that project.","'Desperate Housewives' is an ensemble cast, where I played a tertiary character. I made a lot of great friends, but that show didn't keep me very busy.","In all my characters, I try to find an iota of myself, and in Castle, I found a lot. He gets away with a lot, so that's fun.","I like doing things where I can get dirty, work with my hands, and use power tools. Last weekend, I did some grouting.","You know, I endeavor to be more like my older brother. He's very magnetic. He's actually very much like 'Castle' in that people are attracted to him, and just want to be near him. You want to know where my brother is in a crowded room? He's the guy with the crowd around him.","I think TV has been a little bit irresponsible in how they portray these people because homicide detectives are not brooding, tortured souls who are stained with the stink of the city and who have blood on their hands. They are real, live people that are incredibly entertaining.","'Castle' is a guy living in a fantasy world. He's in his imagination, writing these stories of murder.","'Castle' isn't really affected emotionally by murder. He's thrilled about, 'Oh, my God, I wonder how this happened?'","When people embrace character, there's latzie. It's the stuffing of a scene that's not written. It's not in the stage direction and it's not in the words. When people embrace character, it informs their living, breathing moments in a scene so well.","I kind of fell backwards into acting. I was studying to be a high school teacher. I look now and I understand completely, or actually barely, how much work it is to be a teacher. It's an incredible amount of work.","I'm the kind of guy who, I need a watch that tells me what day it is. I need to know it's Friday on my watch. I need to look at it and go, 'Friday today.' Tomorrow I will not know it's Saturday until I look at my watch. My watchband broke, I was crippled. I have no concept of time, I have no concept of dates.","I like making sci-fi movies because I like watching sci-fi movies. I like watching horror. I like being in a horror movie. I'm a fan. My perspective's a little different just because I get to participate as well as spectate.","I would love to be employed for the rest of my life... But what I would want to do is things that would frighten me, things that would scare me. I've never done that before; can I do that, can I show them that I can do it?","I'll never look down on and I love running into actors who say 'Oh yeah, I did a soap.' I say 'Tell me which one!' It's like being a member of a secret society.","Basically, after an ABC sitcom I did, I ended up with a holding deal with 20th Century Fox. Absolutely cool. It pays you to be unemployed. And the bigger the entity that gives you the deal, the better.","I was shy. I was painfully shy, until fifth grade when I transferred to another school and befriended the class clown. And one day he was sick and I kinda stepped in for the class clown and I said, 'Wow, this is exciting, I'm a little bit nervous.'","I was attending the University of Alberta. I was going to be a high school teacher, like my parents. I failed - no, I didn't fail a class, I just barely passed. I really didn't try. It was Canadian history, through the plays of the time. My God, those were boring plays.","I told myself a while back, 'Love what you do, but don't fall in love with what you do.' That way you won't be brokenhearted if ever it gets canceled five episodes in - which has happened to me.","I have a trophy case that contains all the action figures ever made of me. It also has items I've stolen from my movies, like three guns and holsters from 'Serenity'.","My dinner spot is usually in front of the TV. I'll grill a steak and whip up a salad and watch 'Hoarders'. I love it because a) I'm kind of voyeuristic, and b) every time I see an episode, I go to the one room where all my unpacked boxes wound up, and I throw out a box of stuff.","I love hiking in the hills not far from my house. I'm invested in my hikes. Sometimes kids go up there and spray-paint over the signs; I've found a biodegradable paint cleaner, and I'll scrub the signs so they're nice and clean.","Somebody told me long ago that in acting, it's okay to steal, just steal from the best.","You know, Castle, like anyone else, is a human being first. If you take a human being - especially a vain one like 'Castle' -and you bring in a gorgeous woman and have sparks fly, who can help themselves? What are you gonna do? Sparks happen!","I've got a full plate, yes I do. That iPod, that's nice. A phone recorder? Nicely done. All right I'm a bit of a tech geek. I have a subscription to Popular Science and I keep up on all this stuff.","Working on 'Drive', a lot of fun. This is Tim Minear whom I've worked with before on 'Firefly' of course. He called me up and said, 'I've got a part for you that you will love,' and I love Tim's writing. I love his stories. I love his characters, his dialogue. He has a knack for reveals and he has a knack for moments.","I've always noticed a difference between working with a director and working with a writer/director. In how much they're invested and how specific they are.","There are people who have energy that say 'don't come near me, don't get too close.' There's people like Adrienne Shelley who have the energy of 'come over here and give me a hug and if you're around me you're going to be happy about it.'","I'm constantly pitching one episode where we see life through Castle's eyes. I think Castle's just a little off as far as his perception goes. A very, very clever man, but I want to see the world as Castle sees it - kind of a rose-colored glasses, all the women find him irresistible, all the guys find him super cool and do whatever he says.","My brother used to say that when you deal with women, it's difficult to remove emotions from an argument. I never really knew what he meant. Then I read an article that said when it comes to emotion and logic, men's and women's brains are different - my brother was right! Women are very mysterious, but that's part of their joy.","Oh, boy. I'm still in touch with about 90 percent of my exes. They would describe me as being unlucky in love.","If I got $300 million from the California Lottery, the first thing I would do is buy the rights to 'Firefly', make it on my own, and distribute it on the Internet.","It's so great in Hollywood now. You have people past 40 sitting and talking about serious stuff, writing and making movies and TV, but there's laser pistols and superheroes and alien monsters involved. It's viable and mainstream.","I remember when TiVO first came out I was all about TiVo. I came home and that thing was frozen, and I thought 'This is awful. This is the end of the world'. Then I unplugged it, and I plugged it back in, and still frozen. It was paralyzing. I called them. They said, 'Just unplug it longer.' Fixed. But it also taught me I'm an addict.","I had an Indiana Jones fedora that I loved. I don't know what happened to it. I don't know where it went. Wish I had it back. Whoever's got it, you suck.","I have a lightsaber at my front door for home protection. I have an 800-watt electric skateboard that I use to run errands in my neighborhood. It can go about six, seven miles, so depending on how much time I have, and how much I have to carry home, I'll take it really far. I love that thing.","Karaoke is something that's near and dear and very close to my heart. I was a karaoke host when I was working my way through university. I was a full-time student and karaoke was my night job.","I've kind of learned this about Joss Whedon. Never say never. I've learned that. I also have another rule about Joss Whedon. Never say no. Just... whatever Joss Whedon wants to do, just do it.","I thought what would be really just choice for a revamp and a reboot is 'The Greatest American Hero.' I think I'd be just that kind of perfect not prepared for this kind of thing, but thrust into circumstances he's not prepared for... that's another niche of mine. Unpreparedness. Not knowing what to do. I'm good at being that guy.","My guiltiest pleasure? 'Untamed & Uncut'. Videos of people being attacked by animals. Yeah. I don't know why. I just love seeing guys who say, 'I'm gonna stick my hand in that crocodile's mouth and see what happens.' And then it snaps down on them. There you go - that's what you get! It's a wild animal, my friend.","I love 'Strange Brew'. I quote that movie all the time, and no one knows what I'm talking about.","My first Comic-Con was when I first met Joss Whedon: He introduced me to that world and I'd never been to a convention before that. He and a bunch of the 'Buffy' and 'Angel' writers were all going down in a big van and he invited me along.","You have a dramatic portion of your television program and you treat it dramatically, and then you have a comedic portion of your program, and you treat it differently. Why do you change who are between the two pieces? You're the same person. Just go.","I got amazing training both with Theatre Sports... back in Edmonton, Alberta - I can't give those people enough credit - and the daytime drama I did. Incredible training, both of them.","What I know of Steve Trevor is everything that I learned from 'Wonder Woman,' the television series with Lynda Carter. And I don't remember much. I do remember his uniform, though.","I was a huge comic book fan as a kid. The only problem I had with comic books is how expensive they got. I didn't have a lot of money, so I had to be very specific about what I wanted to collect. I think they're all somewhere in the basement of my folks' house.","I think my printing to this day looks like the printing right out of a comic book. Actually, I always wanted to be in a comic book. I watched cartoons when I was a kid, too, and both comics and cartoons lit fire in my imagination. This realm holds a lot of interest for me, a lot of passion for me. So to be comic-ized, yeah, that's cool.","I've always fantasized about being on TV. And I was. Then I fantasized about being in the movies. What could be better than captain of a space ship? I get to ride horses, shoot guns, have adventures."],"Nathan Gamble":["I was a big fan of Indiana Jones; then I realized he was kind of a fake hero. The real heroes are the people who work hard and do their stuff right, like firefighters and policemen.","I want to keep on progressing. I definitely think acting is a long process to be one of the greats like Morgan Freeman or Jack Nicholson.","I don't even think I'll see all of 'The Mist' until I'm 18. I'm going to the premiere, but I'll close my eyes during the scarier scenes.","I try to be - well, not holy - but my whole family is very religious, and I want to be like that, too. So I try my hardest to be more in touch with the Lord."],"Nathan Hale":["I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.","I wish to be useful, and every kind of service necessary to the public good becomes honorable by being necessary.","It is the duty of every good officer to obey any orders given him by his commander in chief.","I greatly fear some of America's greatest and most dangerous enemies are such as think themselves her best friends.","Shun all vice, especially card playing."],"Nathan Kirsh":["All of my businesses are profitable.","I want money; I just don't want that money lying around.","I like to see a tidy shop, and I want to see my investments well managed.","Shareholders need to have a real interest in the companies they own. Too many are simply too busy - they are asleep at the wheel.","I don't want to be on anyone's board. I just want to have good investments."],"Nathan Kress":["I got good grades in math, but I never really enjoyed it. My favorite part of math was algebra, but geometry was the worst.","My new obsession is 'Storage Wars.' I don't know how such a simple show concept can be so addicting, but I can sit and watch marathons of it.","I'm thankful to say that I already have my dream job. I wouldn't trade it for anything.","Everyone else in the 'iCarly' cast can operate on 5 hours of sleep, but not so for 'Old Man Nathan!'","My favorite thing about acting is that I can play all kinds of different people. Frankly, I don't consider myself a very interesting person, so the characters I play are usually much more fun.","I definitely feel like kids do look up to me as a potential role model. It's an honor, but it can also be a burden. I may be on TV, but I'm also a teenager. I don't get it right every time. But I always do my absolute best to stay above board in every way. My fans inspire me to be a better person.","My biggest hobby is airsoft, which is similar to paintball. Essentially, it's military simulation, but the guns shoot plastic BBs. My friends and I go out in the woods or the desert and play all day long!","I'm an outdoorsy guy, but I also enjoy the average teenager stuff - video games, movies, hanging with friends. I'm just a normal guy!","Since I was very young, probably two or three, I had really good memorization skills. I would memorize stuff from TV and perform it for my family. I was the little performer for most of my early life. So eventually, my mom caught onto that and thought I might want to get into acting.","I'm a really big 'Lord of the Rings' fan. I have all the extended editions.","I do hope to be an adult actor. But if it doesn't work out, I've been thinking about doing something in the medical therapy field, chiropractics or something like that. I've always been into the idea of helping people medically, but I can't stand blood or surgery. That freaks me out. So this would be a bloodless way to help people.","I do enjoy playing some sports, even though none of them are organized. I enjoy football most of all."],"Nathan Lane":["One of the nicest compliments I would get very often on the street is people would say, 'I love you on 'The Good Wife.' I just can't tell whether I should like you or hate you!'","I have to accept the fact that, no matter what I do, it's going to annoy someone.","People have to do things in their own time, and that's what I did.","The thing that everyone remembers about 'Bambi' is that moment. 'The Lion King,' took it to quite an extreme because it was an action sequence: his father was killed in a wildebeest stampede - I related, because mine was, too.","It's certainly not a shock to find that the industry has no imagination. I think people don't know what it is I do. Because half the time you're talking to people who are in their 20s, and I've been doing this for over 25 years.","Look, I'm 40, I'm single, and I work in musical theater - you do the math!","People always think I'm Jewish and changed my last name from Rabinowitz.","I'm still the fat kid from high school who never had a date.","I'm one of those old-fashioned homosexuals, not one of the newfangled ones who are born joining parades.","I am not a sad clown. I am not a sad clown.","I didn't know Charlie before doing the movie, but I was a huge fan of the British Queer as Folk.","All I can do is try to create the best show possible, and I feel we've truly done that.","There are some people that the press like to pick on and not just the gay press, but the press in general. And some people, the press just doesn't care about at all.","I seem to always inspire a strong reaction one way or the other.","There doesn't seem to be a lot of middle ground with me.","It's a cliche, but there really is no handbook about the celebrity thing; you have to figure it out as you go along.","Sure I think it is healthy to speak the truth, and be who you are, and be proud of that.","People think they know who I am, because I've played so many very, very out gay men on stage, and they think that's me.","I don't know what goes on in their heads out in Hollywood.","There's not a day in my life I'm not proud of being gay, but I just wasn't ready for that attention to be placed on it. I remember being on Oprah. Well, not on Oprah. Near Oprah. She started saying, 'Now, Nathan, you got all those girlie moves going down in 'The Birdcage,' where's all that coming from? You're so good at all that girlie stuff!'","Relationships, for me, have been elusive. And I would say mostly it's been my fault. I was always more concentrated on my career. And yes, you do question people's motives. Is it just because I'm him - I'm Nathan Lane?","Not to sound too pessimistic, but I just don't see me having the film career that I maybe hoped for after 'The Birdcage.' I think people just didn't know what to do with me.","The reason I was in most of the movies I've done is that they paid for me to be in the theater.","'The Producers' is a sort of a once in a lifetime kind of phenomenon, and I was grateful to be a part of it.","I never like seeing myself on screen.","A video taped stage performance is just - you know, it's never gonna be the same as it is if you're sitting there live in the theatre.","I want the kind of career where I can move back and forth.","I got to do the movie, and people who enjoyed 'The Birdcage' came out to see me on stage when I did 'Forum.' It introduced me to a whole new audience that wasn't familiar with my stage work.","As a kid, I loved 'Godot' because of the poetry and the humor and the strangeness, but then as you get older, it's much more resonant.","Kevin Costner. I love Kevin Costner. That's all I have to say. I love Kevin Costner.","He's so interesting because you think you know Dennis Hopper, but you don't really know Dennis Hopper. I don't really know Dennis Hopper, I just know him from the silver screen.","I have my aluminum siding business, and that's going like a house afire.","What about Broadway? Yes, I'm involved with a new musical based on 'The Adams Family.'","I was born Joseph Lane, but when I applied to the actors union, they said they already had a Joe Lane on the books and I'd have to change my last or first name. I had played the character of Nathan Detroit, whom I liked very much, in 'Guys and Dolls,' so I took the name Nathan.","I'm really an honorary Jew, you know; all the best people are. I really do feel Jewish, even though I'm a Catholic. The way the Church has been behaving, I'm happy to be Jewish.","My mom was Jewish, so some would call me Jewish."],"Nathan Meyer Rothschild":["Who controls the issuance of money controls the government!","As long as a house is like yours, and as long as you work together with your brothers, not a house in the world will be able to compete with you, to cause you harm or to take advantage of you, for together you can undertake and perform more than any house in the world.","We are like the mechanism of a watch: each part is essential."],"Nathan Myhrvold":["Suppose that every prospective parent in the world stopped having children naturally, and instead produced clones of themselves. What would the world be like in another 20 or 30 years? The answer is: much like today. Cloning would only copy the genetic aspects of people who are already here.","Elections, for their part, are typically popularity contests rather than measures of candidates' relative competency or effectiveness. Imagine if scientific truth were determined according to which scientist was most popular. To be successful, scientists would have to be charismatic and attractive - and human knowledge would suffer terribly.","Cooking is for chefs. Science informs us and lets us cook while knowing what we are doing, but it is not a replacement for the skills of a chef.","One of the problems with posing a 'bold new plan' is that you can't just extrapolate from previous plans.","The depressing thing about battery technology is that it gets better, but it gets better slowly. There are a whole bunch of problems in materials science and chemistry that come in trying to make existing batteries better.","Nuclear energy is a baseload - meaning it's power that you can run any time you want, day or night - and carbon-free.","Now, to find dinosaurs, you hike around in horrible conditions looking for a dinosaur. It sounds really dumb, but that's what it is. It's horrible conditions, because wherever you have nice weather, plants grow, and you don't get any erosion, and you don't see any dinosaurs.","Making money from enforcing patents is no more wrong than investing in preferred stock.","We should have more invention.","I've never filed a patent lawsuit. I hope never to file a patent lawsuit. That may be unrealistic, but it would be great if I could avoid doing it... Lawsuits are a ridiculous way to do business.","We collectively have a special place in our heart for the manned space flight program - Apollo nostalgia is one element, but that is only part of it. American culture worships explorers - look at the fame of Lewis and Clark, for example. The American people want to think of themselves as supporting exploration.","Risk is the sort of word that is easy to discuss upfront but tough to handle when it comes time to pay the piper. There will always be some who wimp out and second-guess when the pain hits, but that is a childish reaction.","There is a one-in-300 chance that Earth will be struck on March 16, 2880, by an asteroid large enough to destroy civilization and possibly cause the extinction of the human race. But, on the bright side, Prince could re-release his hit song with the new refrain 'We're gonna party like its twenty-eight seventy-nine.'","One of the things that I love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites. Because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations, and see where they succeeded and where they failed. Use science to, you know, work backwards and say, 'Well, really, what were they thinking?'","Wine lovers have known for centuries that decanting wine before serving it often improves its flavor. Whatever the dominant process, the traditional decanter is a rather pathetic tool to accomplish it. A few years ago, I found I could get much better results by using an ordinary kitchen blender.","With cult foods, there is an underlying assumption that the best cooking ideas came generations ago. Yet culinary innovation is nothing to be ashamed of. When a chef tells me he is cooking with his grandmother's recipe, I always wonder why. Did talent skip the past two generations?","There's a limit to how much you can deploy renewables, like wind or solar. People will talk about getting up to 30 percent of America's power from renewables, but you can't get to 100 percent because of their unreliability.","Economists want their discipline to be a science, and they have nailed down a few precepts, but many of their debates are still clouded by ideology.","The cloning procedure is similar to IVF. The only difference is that the DNA of sperm and egg would be replaced by DNA from an adult cell. What law or principle - secular, humanist, or religious - says that one combination of genetic material in a flask is OK, but another is not?","The idea behind a dish - the delight and the surprise - makes a difference. Great literature surprises and delights, and provokes us. It isn't just 'Here's the facts - boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.' It's how you tell it.","If people don't find what you are doing threatening, then it is probably not very important.","Age can be wonderful for red wine, but not for spacecraft.","Nobody wants a prediction that the future will be more or less like the present, even if that is, statistically speaking, an excellent prediction.","It is better to predict dramatic things that don't happen than boring things that do.","People get cranky when you burst their bubble. Over time, advances in astronomy have relentlessly reinforced the utter insignificance of Earth on a celestial scale. Fortunately, political and religious leaders stopped barbecuing astronomers for saying so, turning their spits with human-rights activists instead.","Most visions of extraterrestrial life are actually steeped in human hubris. The fictional extraterrestrials of 'Star Trek' or a hundred other space operas are less alien than many of my neighbors. And funny, the ones running the place are mostly WASPish men.","I think you would find almost anyone who stands up for their patent rights has been called a patent troll.","Many of the things the slow food people honor were innovations within historical times. Somebody had to be the first European to eat a tomato.","The whole hardware industry has experienced the phenomenon in which every time computers get cheaper, they appeal to a new set of users; every time they get more powerful, old customers upgrade.","Three things about water affect almost all of cooking. First are the hydrogen bonds, which is why it has an incredibly high boiling point. Another is that it's a polar molecule, so that it dissolves a lot of things, and there are things that won't mix with it. And then there's how much energy it takes to heat water.","I was good at math and science, and I got lots of degrees in lots of things, but in a parallel universe, I probably became a chef.","Anybody who can afford a box of business cards can afford a Web site. Any company with an 800 number can move its services to the Web for peanuts by comparison. The extreme case of corporate promotion is to strip away all other aspects of your business and sell goods or services via the Net alone, as amazon.com has done with books.","We have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it.","I never was a popular kid in class.","If I want popularity, I go to a chef's convention.","If people don't get paid for their inventions, that's not a good thing. In the case of many patents, there are people who aren't in a position to take them to the next level. If you don't enforce your rights, no one is going to enforce them for you.","Microsoft, Apple, Facebook all bought huge patent portfolios to further their strategic game. They're doing what I'm doing!","Our reactor actually burns nuclear waste as fuel. So not only is it safe and powerful, it solves an important issue: It actually reduces nuclear waste instead of creating. It's the reactor of your dreams.","Some article called me the most feared man in Silicon Valley. Good Lord! Why? My teenage boys got a kick out of it: 'Dad, how could this be true? You're not even the most feared person in this house.'","Don't let the secret recipe die with the inventor.","No CEO ever says, 'Damnit, we need to increase research!' I want to encourage them to do that.","I've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue. But barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods like chili, or bouillabaisse. Various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to - there's tremendous traditions; there's secrecy.","Another random thing I do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI. And you may be familiar with the movie 'Contact,' which sort of popularized that. It turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.","When we first did 'Modernist Cuisine,' I think most people in cookbook publishing would have said, 'This is insane.'","My company invents all kinds of new technology in lots of different areas. And we do that for a couple of reasons. We invent for fun - invention is a lot of fun to do - and we also invent for profit. The two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun, you wouldn't have the time to do it.","If you have a block of ballistics gelatin and a high-speed camera, pretty soon somebody gets a gun!","Words can hurt you. In the larger world, it frames how people think about you, and it can hurt you in lots of little, subtle ways.","If we could create invention capitalism, that would be a helluva legacy, that would be a helluva thing to do... We could actually turbocharge the rate at which the world invents things.","One of the greatest things that Apple and Jobs were very good at doing was daring to do the very different thing. It's what I did with my cookbook, frankly.","What you do on a dinosaur expedition is you hike and look at the ground. You find bones sticking out of the dirt and, once you see something, you dig.","Every serious nuclear accident involves operator error, so you want to eliminate the operator altogether.","My career at Microsoft really was getting in the way of my cooking.","Most estimates of the mortality risk posed by asteroid impacts put it at about the same risk as flying in a commercial airliner. However, you have to remember that this is like the entire human race riding the plane - it is one of the few risks that really could wipe us all out.","Sooner or later the space program will need to save us by detecting and deflecting an incoming asteroid.","Within NASA, the shuttle is perhaps the least-groundbreaking project. Recall that Apollo was about creating brand-new technologies that did something unprecedented - putting men on the moon. The shuttle is, by comparison, a relic designed to make going into orbit routine.","Being a visionary is a new profession, but it is really just a variant on fortunetelling, which may be the world's oldest. And its marketing appeal is similar - people will pay for reassurance about the unknown.","The techniques of being an Internet visionary are just like those of lower-tech fortunetellers through the ages. A technological visionary must tell people what they want to hear, because your company's stock won't rise if you spout an unpopular vision to analysts.","Suppose that 'Unsolved Mysteries' called you with news of a long-lost identical twin. Would that suddenly make you less of a person, less of an individual? It is hard to see how. So, why would a clone be different? Your clone would be raised in a different era by different people - like the lost identical twin, only younger than you.","A person's basic humanity is not governed by how he or she came into this world, or whether somebody else happens to have the same DNA.","Regardless of how it's done, transaction costs will continue to plummet as computers get more powerful. Low transaction costs are a wonderful thing if you're in the transaction business. They're wonderful for consumers too, making it cheaper and easier to buy things and creating new things to buy.","The magic words 'on the Internet,' if inserted into nearly any sentence, seem to protect it from normal critical scrutiny.","We're more familiar with what economists call an English auction - prices start low and rise as people bid. However, there is also the Dutch auction, where prices start high and go lower until somebody bites. Movies are sold to the audience via a very slow Dutch auction, where each phase between price drops can last weeks or months.","Micropayments are great if you use them for a product or service with certain properties. It must be one where you can get away with usage-based pricing, and where there is a strong rationale for making it cheap, yet not free.","Business is war! Its leaders are strategic commanders, who boldly snatch victory from the jaws of defeat - and who perform other acts of derring-do. This kind of talk sounds great in the boardroom, and, for that matter, in the bookstore, where dozens of authors counsel would-be corporate warriors.","Software-industry battles are fought by highly paid and out-of-shape nerds furiously pounding computer keyboards while they guzzle diet Coke. The stakes aren't very dramatic. Life? Liberty? The pursuit of happiness? Nope, it's about stock options.","Technological 'revolutions' don't really overthrow anything - they simply append a new and dynamic market to that which went before.","Records were replaced by CDs, and lead type died in favor of computerized fonts. However, each had a 100-year ride of popularity, so you can't feel too bad for them.","Efficiency in government is a more elusive concept than efficiency in the private economy, which may be measured relatively easily as output per units of input. What is the government's 'output?'","An efficient government is dangerous in the hands of the wrong man. Sadly, the right sort of man never seems interested in the job.","The reason societies with democratic governments are better places to live in than their alternatives isn't because of some goodness intrinsic to democracy, but because its hopeless inefficiency helps blunt the basic potential for evil.","The prize for ultimate inefficiency goes to America. We have built in so many checks and balances that our 'leaders' are the most thoroughly hogtied of any on Earth.","The Internet is the ultimate vanity-publishing medium, and therefore, the ultimate place for those of us who like to watch. The Internet can reach an audience at lower cost than any medium before it.","We pay for content that we like, and we like the content we pay for. It's a lot more satisfying to pay $7.50 for Steven Spielberg's next epic than it is to watch my home movies for free. Even for me.","Why pay a fee for Internet content when a million free sites are just a click away? There's no incentive until people are too addicted to the Net to turn off their computers, yet are bored with what's available.","Mankind is not special by virtue of our address in the universe, or what spins around us, or because life originated here. Slowly, but surely, we've been compelled to renounce the comfort of these beliefs.","Life has not been boring for me.","By burning nuclear waste as fuel, we believe we can power the United States cleanly for hundreds of years without ever touching new resources.","It's impossible that we're alone in the universe. Every time we think we're more special than others, we're proven wrong."],"Nathan Outteridge":["I come from the 49er, where there is a high error rate in the sailing but the best sailor still wins, and that's why I'm attracted to these kind of boats.","Nothing fires me up like losing. It certainly makes you want to go that extra bit.","Capsizes kind of go hand in hand with 49er racing. I've had four to five capsizes in races and still won the event. It's just the nature of this type of sailing.","I've been sailing from the age of 2, and apparently, when I was 4, I told my dad, 'I know how to do this; you don't have to come with me anymore.'","The thing I enjoy about going fast is the risk-reward scenario you get. If you make good decisions, the benefits are amazing. If you get it wrong, you can lose so much.","Someone asked me the other day, 'What is your most memorable moment in your career?' and by far, China was. Being so close - the medal race was one part of the story, and there were a few incidents through the event that amounted to that massive drama at the end that cost us the medal.","The strange thing about the Olympics is that delivering on your potential is always quite difficult."],"Nathan Parsons":["Honestly, I'm not interested in gossip. Thing is, I know a lot of successful actors, and in hoping to be successful myself, I would like to think others would respect my privacy.","I probably use email the most. I dunno if that counts as an app. I try to stay off my electronics as much as possible. Real life is happening all around you; you're better off just being a part of it.","I try to get to the gym whenever I can, eat healthy, mostly protein and vegetables, avoid processed sugar and minimize carbs, but I don't feel like I need to go crazy if I want pasta now and then.","I don't think I do look like an A-Lister. I'm more interested in being comfortable in my own skin than trying to be somebody I'm not. Gimme jeans, an old T-shirt, cowboy boots and a baseball cap any day.","When you love somebody, and they have a child, you love their child. You just accept it as a part of who they are, and you care about them and theirs.","I've used my time at 'GH' to learn some discipline.","In L.A., you constantly go on auditions, and you're usually not what they're looking for - you get used to going back and back to the same show, and nothing happens.","As a kid, I was obsessed with myths and legends and the haunting beauty of gothic stories.","I had auditioned for 'The Vampire Diaries' years ago before 'The Originals' happened, so I was familiar with that mythology.","I was so worried when I left 'GH:' so scared I'd never work again."],"Nathan Phillips":["If you are in a beautiful place where you can enjoy sunrise and sunset, then you are living like a lord.","You don't really need much. I try to live my life with that sort of minimalist mentality.","If I had to come back in life, I'd come back as a dolphin... they're always smiling; they're always playing.","I'm a child of the Earth, postcode unknown.","Life's harsh. You can't escape what you are and what you project.","Very happily, I am very fortunate to be able to be where the wind takes me, where the work takes me, and where I want to be.","I have always spent my time more preciously than my money.","Love is a strong, strong thing.","I just happen to love film-making.","Storytelling is essentially what we do.","It's very important to lead your own story: to not be acting as much as you are living.","I live on the beach, and I always will.","There's a stigma attached to being an actor. People from 'Big Brother' call themselves actors. There's so much crap. It's not about appreciating that we're here to service the public, that we're storytellers. It doesn't sit comfortably with me.","It makes me sick to my stomach what Australia Day has become.","I need to have the soul bank full as well as pay the credit cards and have a roof over my head.","Not all of us are born with the same role models and grasp things the same way.","For my first Hollywood film, I really didn't want to be doing a film where I'm looking like a stooge with fake snakes that look like socks.","'Australian Rules' was such a beautiful film - it was art for me.","It's really interesting to play someone you wouldn't want to ever spend more than a couple of drinks with - but who has redeemable characteristics.","It's quite frustrating taking a back seat in films.","It's wonderful to be part of a film that really reaches an audience's mind and an audience's heart.","I think Australia is pretty much living the last day on Earth in a lot of ways.","I'm still very much plugging away. But if I can build my career, I'll do it like Eric Bana. He has a family; he has his roots. He still loves Melbourne. He's a great role model to have.","'Australian Rules' was my moment of truth."],"Nathan Sawaya":["There was a time when I was practicing law in New York and I wanted to find something else to do. So I ended up leaving the practice of law to pursue my art and it just happened to be out of Lego bricks.","I'm an independent artist, but I do have a good business relationship with Lego, since I'm a unique customer. They're aware of what I'm doing. A painter may not have a relationship with a paint maker, but there's only one company that makes Lego.","I think watching Channing Tatum caress his Lego Oscar statue will be something I won't forget. Even if I try.","'The Art of the Brick' is an exhibition I've done where I've taken some works of art from art history and replicated them all out of Lego bricks.","I am confined to the Lego palate. I don't paint the bricks. I stick with what Lego has made. And the idea behind that is I do want to hopefully inspire kids to go home and create on their own. And if I do, I want them to be able to buy those very same bricks I use. So I don't alter the bricks; I just use what's provided.","I have about 4 million Lego bricks. And then a few million in storage in case something comes up. I still pay for them. I buy my bricks just like everyone else. It's by far my biggest capital expense.","I was looking to explore the theme of good and evil, so what better inspiration than the comics? I'd developed a relationship with DC and Warner Bros. when I donated a sculpture of Catwoman to the 'We Can Be Heroes' campaign a few years ago. That's what started it.","I've made a bit of a career taking daunting projects out of Lego. I've done things like a dinosaur skeleton and stuff like that.","I see the world in rectangles. If I am talking to someone, I find myself analysing their face, working out how to recreate it in bricks.","There's a fun, nostalgic aspect to Legos - people connect to the art on a different level. But it's also a medium that lets me design anything I can imagine. I especially enjoy creating curvy forms using rectangular pieces. Up close, you notice the sharp angles, but when you back away, the corners blend into curves.","Kids can't build a marble statue at home. But I've had parents tell me that, after an exhibit, their kids immediately dug out their Lego kits and disappeared for three days.","What do young, budding artists do, but go to law school? I had creative periods now and again, but it wasn't until I was practicing law that I really needed a creative outlet. I'd come home from long days at the office and draw, paint, and sculpt from clay, wire - even candy.","I am an artist who works with Lego.","The team behind 'The Lego Movie' approached me. They wanted to do something extra special for the Academy Award performance of best song nominee 'Everything is Awesome.' They had seen my earlier version of a Lego Oscar statue, and I was happy to take on the challenge.","My work sells for £10,000-plus, but my most lucrative piece was a private project that was sold for more than six figures -dollars, that is. The process of the Lego can take weeks, months, or even days. Each one I deliver to specification to each gallery because they want them brought to them fully formed.","I split my commission and personal work about 50 per cent each. It is important to get that balance in life.","If I'm creating a free-form piece of art, I can make it look like anything I want, and nobody will say it's wrong.","When I was in South Africa, I was meeting with people who never heard of Lego bricks. And yet, when I was like, 'Here they are,' they immediately got it. They saw the appeal, were snapping bricks and creating their little creations right there immediately.","I do hear from people at my exhibition about seeing these things made from this toy from their childhood, and it brings them back. They'll go and buy a set of Lego from the gift shop because of that nostalgia and seeing it at the art exhibition.","So many people have asked me about getting their own LEGO Oscar that I submitted it to LEGO Ideas so that everyone has the ability to get one."],"Nathan Wolfe":["Seasonal flu is now a pandemic that lasts for years and years because you've got so many people that it's jumping back between northern and southern hemispheres and moving itself around the world. By the time it gets back to where it started, it's changed sufficiently so that people are no longer immune.","When there is an influenza threat, drop everything and focus on risks from influenza pandemics. When SARS spreads, focus on unknown respiratory diseases. This approach helps to quell public concern, but it's a hugely inefficient way to deal with future risks.","We see new things all the time. We see new retroviruses out there - which is the category that HIV falls into - and we're very, very concerned because this is the part of the world where HIV jumped from chimpanzees to humans.","If we can provide even a few months of early warning for just one pandemic, the benefits will outweigh all the time and energy we're devoting. Imagine preventing health crises, not just responding to them.","Swine flu is not an anomaly. We know that swine flu - like the vast majority of new outbreaks - comes from animals. We should be monitoring those animals and the humans that come into contact with them, so we can catch these viruses early, before they infect major cities and spread throughout the world.","About 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before.","Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story. Go after the dark matter, in whatever field you choose to explore.","We may have charted all the continents on the planet, and we may have discovered all the mammals, but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth.","Many people on our planet right now despair; they think we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things. I'm going tell you right now: Please don't despair.","If you find diseases before they've really emerged, you can control them early on, before you get a major epidemic.","With epidemics, people have been standing on the shore, waiting for the gusher to hit the ocean. But to prevent epidemics, you have to look at the various little sources that feed into the river.","We know there are certain types of viruses that are nasty - influenza, for instance, is an area that is not a blindside. But a lot of viruses have come out of nowhere, like H.I.V., or to a certain extent SARS. Because we know we have the potential to be blindsided, we really have to investigate the unknowns.","Because pandemics almost always begin with the transmission of an animal microbe to a human, it's work that takes me all around the globe - from rain forest hunting camps of central Africa to wild animal markets of east Asia.","I work to create systems that can accurately detect pandemics early, determine their likely importance, and, with any luck, crush those that have the potential to devastate us.","The features of globalization have huge consequences on pandemics. It just connects us so much more closely... And as a consequence, every one of these viruses that passes from animals to humans has the capacity to infect all of us.","The reality is: By the time swine flu got on the radar screen of global public health, it had already spread. It was already in the States, it was in Mexico, it was in New Zealand. By the time it reaches that point, you've lost the ability to contain it.","There are commonalities among all the pandemics that occur, and we can learn from them. One commonality is that they all come from animals. And the other commonality is that we wait too long.","If we can contain and monitor animal viruses at an earlier stage - when they're first entering human populations, preferably before they've had a chance to become human-adapted, certainly before they've had a chance to spread - we can head off pandemics altogether.","We live in a world fraught with risk from new pandemics. Fortunately, we also now live in an era with the tools to build a global immune system.","Pandemics do not occur randomly. From malaria and influenza to AIDS and SARS, the lethal microbes have come, in the first instance, from animals, especially wild animals. And we increasingly know which parts of the world pose the greatest risk for future incursions.","The world can now maintain an acute infection in a way that is unprecedented in the history of life on our planet.","If an alien visited Earth, they would take some note of humans, but probably spend most of their time trying to understand the dominant form of life on our planet - microorganisms like bacteria and viruses.","As a species, I think we have no choice but to try and forecast pandemics.","We've put huge resources into predicting tsunamis, hurricanes, and earthquakes. HIV/AIDS is like an earthquake that's lasted 30 years and touched every country on the planet. We have such incredible capacity to think about the future, it's time we used it to predict biological threats. Otherwise we'll be blindsided again and again."],"Nathaniel Branden":["The first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance.","Of all the nonsense written about love, none is more absurd than the notion that ideal love is selfless. To love is to see myself in you and to wish to celebrate myself with you. What I love is the embodiment of my values in another person. Love is an act of self-assertion, self-expression and a celebration of being alive.","There is overwhelming evidence that the higher the level of self-esteem, the more likely one will be to treat others with respect, kindness, and generosity.","The United States was the first country in the history of the world to be consciously created out of an idea - and the idea was liberty.","Self esteem is the reputation we acquire with ourselves.","Tell me how a person judges his or her self-esteem, and I will tell you how that person operates at work, in love, in sex, in parenting, in every important aspect of existence - and how high he or she is likely to rise. The reputation you have with yourself - your self-esteem - is the single most important factor for a fulfilling life.","Live with integrity, respect the rights of other people, and follow your own bliss.","Romantic love can be terrifying. We experience another human being as enormously important to us. So there is surrender - not a surrender to the other person so much as to our feeling for the other person. What is the obstacle? The possibility of loss.","Between the ages of 24 and 27, I read Freud's complete works, everything that had been translated into English. It was very stimulating intellectually. But I did not accept his view of neurosis or of human nature.","In a world in which the total of human knowledge is doubling about every ten years, our security can rest only on our ability to learn.","If we are happy within ourselves, we don't accept or demand that our partner should fulfill every need. We need to be comfortable with our own company.","Productive achievement is a consequence and an expression of health and self-esteem, not its cause.","A woman in love will do almost anything for a man, except give up the desire to improve him.","Not a great deal is known about the factors in childhood that doubtless underlie a person's choice of career - I'm talking now about a career to which one is passionately committed, in contradistinction to a career chosen merely as a means of earning a living.","I cannot remember a time when the question of why people behave as they do was not intensely interesting to me. The desire to understand was very important. When I was young, I was aware of the fact that much of the time, the reasons a person gave for his actions were not the actual reasons.","When I was a child, I felt at times that I had been born into an insane asylum, that much of human life appeared to be an insane asylum. It was bewildering.","Self-esteem is a powerful force within each of us... Self-esteem is the experience that we are appropriate to life and to the requirements of life.","To love a person is to know and love the person. But we can pick up an enormous amount about another human being just by exchanging a couple of sentences. It's not yet knowledge; it's an intuition that motivates you to want to find out more."],"Nathaniel Buzolic":["I do love to capture beauty in this world. And photos can last the test of time.","People say I look like a vampire. I don't know whether to take that as a compliment or not.","I love to meet the fans. I just get embarrassed with those who weep. I don't know what to do or what to say. It's a very embarrassing situation.","I tweeted once, and I still stick to this, that I would love to marry a Croatian girl. I want my children to speak Croatian first, and for them to do that, we need someone who speaks very good Croatian.","I really miss the Australian lifestyle and being around my friends and family."],"Nathaniel Hawthorne":["Time flies over us, but leaves its shadow behind.","Happiness is a butterfly, which when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp, but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you.","Words - so innocent and powerless as they are, as standing in a dictionary, how potent for good and evil they become in the hands of one who knows how to combine them.","Mountains are earth's undecaying monuments.","Accuracy is the twin brother of honesty; inaccuracy, of dishonesty.","Moonlight is sculpture.","Sunlight is painting.","The greatest obstacle to being heroic is the doubt whether one may not be going to prove one's self a fool; the truest heroism is to resist the doubt; and the profoundest wisdom, to know when it ought to be resisted, and when it be obeyed.","Every individual has a place to fill in the world and is important in some respect whether he chooses to be so or not.","The founders of a new colony, whatever Utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project, have invariably recognized it among their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery, and another portion as the site of a prison.","What we call real estate - the solid ground to build a house on - is the broad foundation on which nearly all the guilt of this world rests.","We sometimes congratulate ourselves at the moment of waking from a troubled dream; it may be so the moment after death.","A pure hand needs no glove to cover it.","No man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.","Our Creator would never have made such lovely days, and have given us the deep hearts to enjoy them, above and beyond all thought, unless we were meant to be immortal.","Love, whether newly born, or aroused from a deathlike slumber, must always create sunshine, filling the heart so full of radiance, this it overflows upon the outward world.","What other dungeon is so dark as one's own heart! What jailer so inexorable as one's self!","Our most intimate friend is not he to whom we show the worst, but the best of our nature.","Happiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally. Make it the object of pursuit, and it leads us a wild-goose chase, and is never attained. Follow some other object, and very possibly we may find that we have caught happiness without dreaming of it.","Religion and art spring from the same root and are close kin. Economics and art are strangers.","Life is made up of marble and mud.","The world owes all its onward impulses to men ill at ease. The happy man inevitably confines himself within ancient limits.","We must not always talk in the market-place of what happens to us in the forest.","Easy reading is damn hard writing.","Selfishness is one of the qualities apt to inspire love.","Caresses, expressions of one sort or another, are necessary to the life of the affections as leaves are to the life of a tree. If they are wholly restrained, love will die at the roots.","A woman's chastity consists, like an onion, of a series of coats.","Nobody, I think, ought to read poetry, or look at pictures or statues, who cannot find a great deal more in them than the poet or artist has actually expressed. Their highest merit is suggestiveness.","It contributes greatly towards a man's moral and intellectual health, to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself, who care little for his pursuits, and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate.","In our nature, however, there is a provision, alike marvelous and merciful, that the sufferer should never know the intensity of what he endures by its present torture, but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it.","All brave men love; for he only is brave who has affections to fight for, whether in the daily battle of life, or in physical contests.","The only sensible ends of literature are, first, the pleasurable toil of writing; second, the gratification of one's family and friends; and lastly, the solid cash.","My fortune somewhat resembled that of a person who should entertain an idea of committing suicide, and, altogether beyond his hopes, meet with the good hap to be murdered.","A hero cannot be a hero unless in a heroic world.","Nobody has any conscience about adding to the improbabilities of a marvelous tale.","A stale article, if you dip it in a good, warm, sunny smile, will go off better than a fresh one that you've scowled upon.","You can get assent to almost any proposition so long as you are not going to do anything about it."],"Nathaniel Kahn":["I know I should feel anger at my father for certain things. But since he died when I was 11, I never got to that point.","There are a lot of bad films out there. There's a lot of bad architecture out there, and I think sometimes it takes a lot of time to begin to see what's really good. And I think what the test seems to be is, what really sticks with you. And what really becomes a part of your life.","My father was my hero, and he died when I was 11. So, I really never experienced the kind of natural teenage rebellion or the anger at him. I never experienced those feelings as a young person.","As a child, my father's architecture seemed to me to be industrial in a way. It seemed harsh and kind of chilly; I didn't respond to it."],"Nathaniel Parker Willis":["The lily and the rose in her fair face striving for precedence.","If there is anything that keeps the mind open to angel visits, and repels the ministry of ill, it is human love.","Gratitude is not only the memory but the homage of the heart rendered to God for his goodness.","The innocence that feels no risk and is taught no caution, is more vulnerable than guilt, and oftener assailed.","Press on! for in the grave there is no work and no device. Press on! while yet you may.","At present there is no distinction among the upper ten thousand of the city.","He who binds his soul to knowledge, steals the key of heaven."],"Nathaniel Philbrick":["The great lesson I get from 'Moby-Dick' is that when the times are bad, when there is great foreboding, there are still ways to go about living. It's through Ishmael that I find a kind of overall cosmic approach to a meaningful life in this meaningless world.","In all natural disasters through time, man needs to attach meaning to tragedy, no matter how random and inexplicable the event is.","In the years to come, the combination of climate change and population growth could have a devastating effect on the planet and, needless to say, on humanity.","After Brown, I went to Duke, to a Ph.D. program in American literature. My dad's an English professor. After a year there, I was like, 'Jesus. I don't want to do this. I don't want to be in the library.' So I pulled the ripcord, and that was it.","Whaling was the oil business of its day.","Most Americans have no clue that before there were highways, there were only waterways to get through the wilderness. If you weren't on a lake or a river, you were in a jungle.","One of the questions I face when working on a book about a historical event is whether I should visit the actual place that I'm writing about. No matter how scrupulously maintained a historic house or battlefield may be, it is nothing like it was in the long-ago past.","For the very young, there's nothing better than Mother Goose and anything by Dr. Seuss for the rhythms and language.","A good leader has to at some point trust those around him; otherwise, nothing constructive is going to get done.","There's an ugly civil war side to revolutionary Boston that we don't often talk about and a lot of thuggish, vigilante behavior by groups like the Sons of Liberty.","The irony is that Washington was, in reality, very much like Benedict Arnold. The big difference was that Washington was ultimately able to control his emotions, something Arnold never learned to do.","It is impossible to say when 37-year-old Benedict Arnold first met 18-year-old Peggy Shippen, but we do know that on September 25, 1778, he wrote her a love letter - much of it an exact copy of one he'd sent to another woman six months before. But if the overheated rhetoric was recycled, Arnold's passion was genuine.","Nantucket's English settlers, who first disembarked on the island in 1659, had been mindful of the sea's dangers. They had hoped to earn their livelihoods not as fishermen but as farmers and shepherds on this grassy isle dotted with ponds, where no wolves preyed.","The American Revolution as it actually unfolded was so troubling and strange that once the struggle was over, a generation did its best to remove all traces of the truth.","When I was at Brown, I wanted to write the great American novel, but I was too scared to take a creative course. I signed up for one, got in, and just didn't have the courage to go. I was a tremendously shy person, almost pathologically shy. The thought of peers critiquing my work - oh, God.","You know, if you're at home with children, you lose twenty-five IQ points.","Writing can't be too calculated. My best writing is when I set it aside, move on. It's not when I'm crafting a sentence, thinking about what word should follow another.","Whatever you read, there's no better place to read than the cockpit or the berth of a boat. It's kind of like being in a womb.","A survival tale peels away the niceties and comforts of civilization. Suddenly, all the technology and education in the world means nothing. I think all of us wonder while reading a survival tale, 'What would I have done in this situation? Would I have made it?'","To my mind, an adventure is something a person willingly undertakes.","If you live on Nantucket, you can't avoid its history, and 'Moby Dick' is the way most of us get into Nantucket's history.","As an author of narrative history, I read a lot of history books.","As a former English major, I have always been fascinated by the connections between literature and history.","You cannot underestimate the influence of Shakespeare.","Even though I hadn't read a word of it, I grew up hating 'Moby-Dick.'","For me, 'Moby-Dick' is more than the greatest American novel ever written; it is a metaphysical survival manual - the best guidebook there is for a literate man or woman facing an impenetrable unknown: the future of civilization in this storm-tossed 21st century.","Instead of being a page-turner, 'Moby-Dick' is a repository of American history and culture and the essentials of Western literature. The book is so encyclopedic that space aliens could use it to re-create the whale fishery as it once existed on the planet Earth in the midst of the 19th century.","For me, the hardest thing in the world is how to start a book.","I consider myself a writer who happens to write about history, rather than a historian. I was an English major in college. What I've learned about history is in the field, so to speak. Going into the archives and working with it directly.","Some of my books sort of have a provocative take. Sometimes you find interesting things about characters that show they weren't necessarily the way people usually see them. It can make for lively conversations, but that's great. Spark a little controversy, get people to think about it. That's what it's all about.","Many of us came away from our youth thinking that the story of the Revolution was that the Americans were patriots fighting the oppressive British. It was kind of good versus evil, liberty versus tyranny. When you get into it, you find that it was much more complicated.","I'll watch anything, from action to art films.","I watch a lot of bad TV. I spend my entire day reading and writing, and after dinner my idea of fun is just to watch a lot of bad TV. That's how I relax and stay in touch with modern culture.","XTC is my favorite band; I'm a huge Neil Young fan, Jayhawks, all that type of stuff. I like Death Cab for Cutie, also Ryan Adams. I try to impress my children: 'Have you listened to such-and-such?' They're not impressed.","Martin Scorsese, everything he does, I've got to see. And Jack Nicholson, I've got to see what he does.","'Moby-Dick' has a remarkable way of resonating with whatever is going on in the world at that particular moment.","Reading 'Moby-Dick' helps you discover how to live.","As long as I can remember, I've been writing - first poems, then stories, and by my early teenage years I was also in love with sailing.","I follow the Patriots, but the Steelers were my first and true love. I still have a 'Terrible Towel.'","I'm a big Stephen King fan.","In my early 20s, I was a big fan of Theodore Dreiser and might be one of the few people on the planet who have voluntarily read all his novels.","Maybe it's because I was named for him, but I've always wanted to meet Nathaniel Hawthorne. It's oversimplifying, but all Hawthorne's short stories and novels are, in one way or another, about guilt. Something profoundly disturbing must have happened to him at an early age. I'd like to know what that was.","I hated the fact that I had to read 'Moby-Dick' as a senior in high school.","I'm not one of these people who want to tear down our heroes and that kind of thing.","History is obviously dependent on the evidence, and it's always amazing to me how much evidence there is.","Washington worked very hard to create his legacy. Even before the War of Independence was over, he was assembling his papers and making sure they were going to be in a state of preservation that would represent as best he could the official side of what occurred during the Revolution.","'Johnny Tremain,' Paul Revere's Ride, today's Tea Partiers - you have to tune all that out to get at the real story.","I don't subscribe to the idea that the founders or anyone else were somehow better than us and that we have to live up to their example.","Unfortunately, we have a tendency to see figures from the past as caricatures - either all good or all bad - when the truth is always much more complex.","We think of Washington as the defensive-minded pragmatist who won the Revolution by avoiding unnecessary risks on the battlefield. But that was not how he started out.","What's been largely forgotten is that Washington was highly passionate and aggressive, and it was only after losing Philadelphia to the British after a string of disastrous battlefield performances that he finally resigned himself to the more conservative approach with which he has since become associated.","We've got a yawl named the Phebe, which is named for a boat in a whaling journal my father and I edited. We keep a copy of the journal on board.","Nantucket was a Quaker-based culture, so they were not readers. There's a great Nantucket-based novel from the 19th century that Melville read for his research for 'Moby-Dick': 'Miriam Coffin' by Joseph Hart.","Joseph Warren, like a lot of revolutionary leaders, was into Enlightenment literature.","I do work-related stuff on airplanes. Then, when I'm in the hotel room or just vegging out, I read for pleasure.","I was an English major at Brown. I never enjoyed history classes.","I had a great AP U.S. History teacher in Pittsburgh. We still exchange Christmas cards. She was the first teacher who said I was a good writer - and I'd never heard that before. And so I remember that, and I remember that level of loving the material and really loving writing about it.","We think of the revolution ending in Yorktown, Va. The fact of the matter is that the French defeated the British in a naval battle right in the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. Because the British fleet was coming to rescue Cornwallis, the British general, Washington was able to surround Cornwallis.","He was born in 1741, a descendant of the Rhode Island equivalent of royalty. The first Benedict Arnold had been one of the colony's founders, and subsequent generations had helped to establish the Arnolds as solid and respected citizens.","More than 25 miles off the coast of Massachusetts and only 14 miles long, Nantucket is, as Herman Melville wrote in 'Moby-Dick,' 'away off shore.'","Right whales - so named because they were 'the right whale to kill' - grazed the waters off Nantucket as if they were seagoing cattle, straining the nutrient-rich surface of the ocean through the bushy plates of baleen in their perpetually grinning mouths.","By 1760, the Nantucketers had virtually exterminated the local whale population."],"Nathaniel Rateliff":["I'm pretty easily overwhelmed and pretty tough as well. I think I'm tougher than I used to be. There's been a lot of hardship along the way. But that's what life is. And it's how you deal with those things, and how you let them shape you that makes you a better person and defines what sort of person you're going to be.","Success will be when I can have a real swimming pool instead of the fifty-dollar one I buy at Kmart every year. But I don't want to get robbed of any authenticity to try and make money.","When I was a kid, we weren't really supposed to listen to secular music. But one day, I found a 'Led Zeppelin IV' cassette tape in the garage, and it was just amazing-sounding music, not like anything I'd heard before. I remember thinking: 'Well, if God created music, why is his music in church not as good as this?'","There isn't much of a music scene in Hermann, unless you like polka. But the landscape I grew up in is a part of me. I spent a lot of time in the woods doing a lot of nothing to break the boredom.","Growing up in the middle of nowhere, there was a lot of twangy music around, but it didn't really connect with me then.","I first moved to Denver to work with a group called YWAM, 'Youth With a Mission.' I was a kid - I was 18 - and did some work with homeless people. Really, trying to convert people is sort of an awful position to find yourself in, so I quickly, on my own, grew out of religious ideas.","When I was a kid, my dad kind of forced me to sing the third harmony for our little family group, and I just kind of hated it. I just felt so uncomfortable on stage, too shy.","There's this element of surprise when you're writing songs, like it's something outside of you that you get to be part of. And it's just exciting. And that's why I keep writing - because I like that feeling.","Sometimes, if I allow time to be creative, it doesn't show up.","Sometimes, I don't like making emotions your career; something about it is kind of gross. But, at the same time, I want to move people the same way the songs make me feel.","I've always been trying to write songs that hit you in the stomach but ones that make people feel like things will be just fine.","I'd always wanted to do an R&B and soul record; a friend with a studio asked to come by and record a couple of songs, maybe just make a 45. Then the songs started to pour out, and pretty soon we had eight or 10 songs down.","I've always loved soul, R&B, doo-wop and blues, and I've wanted to make a record like that for years.","Roadrunner wanted to make Born in the Flood the next Nickelback, but I didn't want to be that. I didn't want to be a huge rock star playing songs I didn't like. I didn't want to be stuck playing 'Anthem,' the song everybody liked but I didn't want to put on the record, for the next five years.","My mom played 12-string and sang, and my dad could play pretty much any wind instrument and had a great ear for harmony. Soon enough, my sister and I got into music because we were always around it, and people were always listening to it.","One of my initial memories of being taken over by music was watching Paul McCartney on TV play a tribute to John Lennon. He was playing piano by himself and singing 'Imagine,' and I remember feeling an anxiety and shortness of breath.","The last album, 'Falling Faster Than You Can Run.' I was really proud of, but then I didn't actually know whether it was going to come out on any label at all. So I didn't know if anyone was going to hear it. Then of course we ended up doing another EP after that called 'Closer.'","I toured a lot in the U.K. and Europe solo for a lack of funds, really. I left people I'd been playing with for years at home, just because I couldn't afford it.","My original project was called 'The Wheel'; there's a record out there called 'Desire & The Dissolving Man,' 'The Memory Of Loss' as well. There's also 'Falling Faster Than You Can Run,' also 'Closer'; all of that's on our website."],"Nathaniel Rich":["Criticism always seemed to me a lot like police work. You look for clues, fingerprints, motives. You need to construct an airtight case.","There is something fascinating about every human being. The question is how much they're willing to divulge.","I studied literature and Italian at Yale. I wrote my thesis about Italo Svevo, one of my heroes.","I live in New Orleans, because it's the strangest city in the United States. It has the highest murder rate in the country, the highest incarceration rate, and often we have to boil our drinking water, but there's nowhere else remotely like it.","I try to write 1,000 words. Some people say it's not about the quantity but about the quality. I disagree. You need to write a lot in order to figure out what's good and what's crap.","In my experience, scientists are not always the most socially adjusted people, and may have habits and fascinations outside of their work that others might consider odd."],"Nathaniel Smith":["There is here, as in all countries, advantages and disadvantages.","We fear our passage will be attended with difficulties by reason of the great number of passingers which are one hundred and eighty and upwards in number.","May the Lord our God prepare us for every event, then comes Life or Death - it is no great matter.","But the worst of all is, according to the old phrase, while the grass grows, the horse starves, but the man of money is the man for Nova Scotia. Those may do extremely well.","There is much boasting among the young men about their teams as their horse and carts in Cleveland. Most of the Yorkshire men take as much delight in their ox draught as they used to do in their Horse Draught.","If the people in Britain knew the nature and disposition of the New England people as well as we do they would not find so many friends in England as I suppose they do."],"Natsuki Takaya":["As a child, because manga was always around and I was reading it, I naturally thought, 'Hey, I'd like to draw manga - I'd like to be a manga author!'","I think that nationality has no relation to that which gives rise to manga. Even among the Japanese, manga creators are making their creations everyday reflecting their own individuality, with none being the same. What is important isn't the differences between the creators but their love for manga.","Above and beyond drawing my creations, I try to incorporate some kind of message. I try not to end as merely a question but try to provide a conclusion within the work.","Simply put, I'm glad that manga as an expressive form is expanding.","Before and after my debut, I've helped out other manga artists from time to time, but I have no experience of being exclusively an assistant. Nor have I done individual or self-published manga.","I'm the sort of person that doesn't really have specific 'inspiration.' It probably comes more from my doubts and my desires."],"Natsuo Kirino":["I started writing juvenile novels around 1985. I never really thought of it as a career, but more as a way to make a living.","One of my books, 'Rain Falling on My Face,' earned me the 39th Edogawa Ranpo prize. It's a very prestigious literary prize in Japan, mostly for mysteries and thrillers.","For research, I like to go to the location of the places in the novels. The first thing that I do is involve my senses: I notice the smells; I open the trash cans and look at what people have thrown away.","'Out' was my real breakthrough, the novel that became a hit in Japan and sold a lot of books, so it was sort of an obvious choice for being the first book to be translated into English.","I first thought about becoming a writer after the age of 30, which is rather late, I'd say. In my 20s, I wasn't especially good at anything, and I didn't have a lot of experiences. I was just a young woman without a good job.","In Japan, full-time homemakers have no economic power of their own, and they socially lead a faceless, anonymous existence.","I don't know if foreigners will take to my novels or not. It may be that my books appeal only to a particular gender or age group rather than convey a more universal appeal.","The thing I don't like about detective stories is looking for criminals.","A crime is like a crack in reality, and it is the author's role to explore those cracks. As a writer, I like to see how they impinge on people.","It's a very confusing experience living as a woman in Japan. If your husband is white-collar, the wife is blue. Even if you marry a person of status, the wife inevitably remains a rung below.","I'm happy to be told that I am beautiful, but I don't gain anything from that."],"Naturi Naughton":["I don't just want to be a cute girl in a comedy or the actress who just does the same thing over and over again. I want to play roles that are distinct. I want to have a more varied career like actresses Viola Davis or Angela Bassett - those are the people that I grew up watching and admiring.","I want to do stories that inspire people.","I'm a true singer who grew up singing in church, so I love singing my heart out.","Oh, you know, I think it was definitely a little pressure, to remake something like 'Fame'.","I was excited to play Lil' Kim and I wanted to do the role justice. I worked really hard on that role, whether it was performing the rhymes, studying the dialect, her swagger and her stage performances. I wanted people to see my range and stretch my wings as an actress.","One of my biggest inspirations growing up was Whitney Houston, so I was devastated to hear about her passing. I'm from East Orange, New Jersey, and started singing at New Hope Baptist Church, so she was like my fellow Jersey girl.","I work out and go to the gym, but I still enjoy my soul food and snacks. But I'm a pretty petite young woman, and I just do everything in moderation and make sure that I just keep everything together.","Singing is my passion and something that I still love to do and I'm always going to want to do it.","As a black actress you've got to work doubly hard. But it doesn't ever get me to the point where I give up on myself. It just motivates me to be more prepared, focus and disciplined. That's why I care so much about doing black films and making sure that we represent and are represented correctly.","I was pretty young when I decided I wanted to, well, more so be a singer. I started singing in church in my hometown, East Orange, New Jersey. I knew when I was about five or six that I wanted to be a performer.","Starting in music, where I get a chance to connect with the lyrics of a song, I learned so much about performing on stage and connecting to your audience and to what you're singing about. Singing is very emotional. Every song has its own purpose.","I want to be back on Broadway one day. That's a dream of mine. There's nothing like live theater, and I think it's so important for me to be able to be on stage with an audience that responds.","I think a lot of young people don't realize the price of fame is a lot higher than they imagine."],"Naval Ravikant":["The ledger, the distributed database - it's called a Blockchain - is held in the cloud by all the parties involved. It can't be broken by any of them. It's cryptographically too strong. You would have to compromise the entire network to take over Bitcoin.","Figure out what you're good at and start helping other people with it; give it away. Pay it forward. Karma sort of works because people are very consistent. On a long enough timescale, you will attract what you project.","Cryptocurrency currencies take the concept of money, and they take it native into computers, where everything is settled with computers and doesn't require external institutions or trusted third parties to validate things.","Any competent programmer has an API to cash, payments, escrow, wills, notaries, lotteries, dividends, micropayments, subscriptions, crowdfunding, and more.","China may censor YouTube. China may censor Twitter. They won't be able to censor Bitcoin. There's no central authority. There's no one you can go to and say, 'We're going to turn Bitcoin off.'","We can code wills, escrows, trusts, notaries, revokable charge backs, proof of contracts, intellectual property enforcement. What Wall Street does can be done in code by Bitcoin.","Entrepreneurship is really hard and painful - I'm not sure I'd recommend it for anyone who can't handle the extreme stress.","Think of Bitcoin as a bank account in the cloud, and it's completely decentralized: not the Swiss government, not the American government. It's all the participants in the network enforcing.","We're going to try and prove to the market that you can do a legal coin offering. If the SEC doesn't crack down, this party will be amazing - the biggest party in town for a long time. If they do crack down, a lot of people are going to feel a lot of pain.","Cryptocurrencies are an emergent property of the Internet - almost a fifth protocol in the Internet suite. If Satoshi Nakomoto did not exist, it would still be necessary to invent them.","Money is a bubble that never pops. It's a consensus hallucination.","Having a million-dollar net worth doesn't make you a genius, and having less than a million-dollar net worth doesn't make you a fool.","It's almost always possible to be honest and positive.","The best founders are extremely thoughtful and have an eye for quality. I don't know if there's any generic advice here that would be helpful. Startup knowledge is a moving target.","Our mission is to help founders and anyone or anything that helps founders helps us with our mission.","I think it just helps to be very aware that fundamentally, there are no adults. Everyone is making it up as they go along. You have to find your own path, picking, choosing, taking and discarding as you see fit.","Be present. Be meditative. Form real friendships. Stay away from business networking events or friendships where there is always an underlying business angle.","I think of Twitter as the place where I go to have a great conversation when I can't have one locally, which seems to be all the time, and the more time that I spend on Twitter, the more I sort of curate this incredible group of very intelligent people that I just get to know purely through the quality of their thoughts.","People think about Bitcoin incorrectly. They think about it as currency or about gold or hoarding, speculation, about how much money do you make. When really, what it is is an API for programmable cash transactions.","There's so much innovation going on, and there are lots of people funding that innovation, but there's very little innovation on that infrastructure for innovation itself, so we like to do that ourselves to help companies create more tech companies.","ICOs are obviously a new and interesting form of funding for blockchain-based protocols, but it's not clear that all of them comply with U.S. securities laws or that all of them are companies that have good native use cases for new coins.","It's important not to think about Bitcoin as a replacement for cash or gold or something that works alongside that; it's to think of it as programmable money. And we just cannot even imagine what that will be used for.","Oddly enough, Bruce Lee wrote some great philosophy.","I think almost everything about humans and human civilization is explained better by evolution than anything else.","A block chain is a series of blocks. Each block is a series of computations done by computers all over the world using serious cryptography in a way that's very hard to undo.","Within my social circle, there is a large group of people who will take bitcoin as legal tender; like, you can go to them and settle debts in Bitcoin, and they will happily take it.","If you use a bad password, your Bitcoin will get stolen.","It's probably easier and cheaper to counterfeit hundred-dollar bills than it is to counterfeit Bitcoin.","I think long-term, Bitcoin is a currency of the Internet. So, even if humans don't use it, routers will use it. Web browsers will use it. Web servers will use it.","If you're investing in a company in the Bitcoin economy, you have to compare the valuation of the company to the valuation of the entire economy.","Humans don't 'need' math-based cryptocurrencies when dealing with other humans. We walk slowly, talk slowly, and buy big things. Credit cards, cash, wires, checks - the world seems fine.","Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are already trustless - any machine can accept it from any other, securely. They are (nearly) free. They are global - no central bank required, and any machine can speak the language.","Nation states that are used to imposing capital controls will face a quandary: ban cryptocurrencies and live in the technology dustbin; enable them, and this virus - this religion, this protocol - will enable the free flow of money and language, along with packets, around the globe.","Cryptocurrencies will create a fifth protocol layer powering the next generation of the Internet.","Just as the web democratized publishing and development, Bitcoin can democratize building new financial services. Contracts can be entered into, verified, and enforced completely electronically, using any third-party that you care to trust, or by the code itself.","While the traditional banks and credit card companies lock down access to their payments infrastructure to a handful of trusted parties, Bitcoin is open to all.","Take a very small amount of money, your throwaway money, treat it as if it's already gone, you've mentally set it on fire, and put it in some distribution of a few truly legit layer 1 blockchains."],"Naveen Andrews":["Older women know who they are, and that makes them more beautiful than younger ones. I like to see a face with some character. I want to see lines. I want to see wrinkles.","If you don't take the chance to live life, what can you say at the end of it?","A slice of hot, buttered toast is the perfect meal. It's not too much and not too little, and it gives you just the right buzz.","I think that reality TV is so bad. It is a tool by the media to not make people think.","I was always in trouble from an early age. I had a fraught relationship with my parents, who were very traditional. Doing plays at school was a joyous release.","Let's just say I was really bad. Now I have grown into myself. I have changed.","Only when I came to America did I think of myself as British.","The older I get, the more I'm prepared to do things for the money.","It is not easy to get parts in mainstream films for most people of color. Hollywood and British writers are not writing parts for us, or the directors are not interested in casting us in parts that are color-blind.","I'm not an academic, but I've always loved poetry since I've been small.","Just because I never went to university doesn't mean you can't read, although I do feel a bit uneducated from time to time.","I think any actor should be aware of where they're starting to stretch into what's not truthful.","The unknown is always frightening.","I couldn't bloody believe a prime-time TV show would have an Iraqi ex-Republican Guard torturer as a main character.","My mum made a conscious decision not to teach me any Indian languages so I wouldn't talk with an accent.","Los Angeles is the only place that I can honestly say I have ever called home.","I never felt at home in London, because people were constantly telling me I didn't belong here, so after a while, you tend to believe that.","I think I may have failed at a lot of things, but the one thing I can say, and that I'm proud of, is that I am a good parent."],"Naveen Jain":["Being a father has been, without a doubt, my greatest source of achievement, pride and inspiration. Fatherhood has taught me about unconditional love, reinforced the importance of giving back and taught me how to be a better person.","Success doesn't necessarily come from breakthrough innovation but from flawless execution. A great strategy alone won't win a game or a battle; the win comes from basic blocking and tackling.","Stay focused on the mission.","The human brain works as a binary computer and can only analyze the exact information-based zeros and ones (or black and white). Our heart is more like a chemical computer that uses fuzzy logic to analyze information that can't be easily defined in zeros and ones.","Clearly, we are not programmed at birth to behave a certain way based on our gender. Instead, we are trained throughout our lives to conform to our gender norms.","I believe our legacy will be defined by the accomplishments and fearless nature by which our daughters and sons take on the global challenges we face. I also wonder if perhaps the most lasting expression of one's humility lies in our ability to foster and mentor our children.","A person who sees a problem is a human being; a person who finds a solution is visionary; and the person who goes out and does something about it is an entrepreneur.","To nurture the sort of relationships that will truly help propel you towards accomplishing great things, you need to forget transactional networking and focus on having in-depth conversations with fewer people about subjects you really care about.","You know you've reached true success the day you become truly humble. That's the day you stop needing to prove to the world - and yourself - that you've accomplished something meaningful.","There is no longer a doubt that women are just as competent as men. Gender differences are guided by nurture, as society treats boys and girls differently from an early age.","As an entrepreneur, you only fail when you give up.","Many of the problems of poverty and need are really problems of physical infrastructure: not enough hospitals, too few schools, insufficient roads, bridges, and a lack of tools. This is what makes traditional philanthropy so daunting. You could build a thousand new hospitals in some parts of the world and barely make a difference.","By understanding and harnessing the forces that drive human behavior, you can create a self-sustaining philanthropic effort that reaches millions of people. It begins with an entrepreneurial attitude: take an idea and execute on that idea. If it doesn't work, learn why and build on what you've learned.","Your initial idea may or may not work, but you have to remember that a failed idea is nothing but a stepping stone to a bigger success.","Philanthropy is not about giving money but about solving problems. While well-meaning, the idea of writing a check and calling it 'philanthropy' is extremely short-sighted and unfortunately, extremely pervasive.","As an entrepreneur, you tend to see the opportunities where others see none.","Each one of us has the power to be the change we want to see in the world, making the world a better place.","I think it's time we all agree that gender stereotypes are simply the confabulation of our own mind.","If there is one thing I have learned on this incredible journey we call life, it is this: the sign of a truly successful individual is humility.","While most philanthropists tend to flock together and build their teams around friends, family, or others who happen to be retired or with a lot of free time on their hands, a great entrepreneur knows that success is directly related to the quality and talents of their team.","Just think of the opportunities we can unlock by making education as addictive as a video game. This type of experiential, addictive learning improves decision-making skills and increases the processing speed and spatial skills of the brain. When was the last time your child asked for help with a video game?","I absolutely believe in the power of innovative entrepreneurship on every level. That's why I am exploring ways to improve our education system by making it as effective as a private tutor and as engaging as video games.","Philanthropy without scale and sustainability is like any other bad business that will simply wither and die on the vine.","It's a simple fact: no individual can be good at everything. Everyone needs people around them who have complimentary sets of skills.","Trust your gut instinct over spreadsheets. There are too many variables in the real world that you simply can't put into a spreadsheet. Spreadsheets spit out results from your inexact assumptions and give you a false sense of security. In most cases, your heart and gut are still your best guide.","As a father, I believe that involving children in sports at a young age is generally, a wise proposition. I believe that healthy competition is... well... healthy; that sporting events foster a spirit of teamwork that far surpasses the events themselves; and that active participation keeps children moving and is good for their self-esteem.","If you know you are giving your best effort, you'll never have any reason for regrets.","The truth is, what Americans enjoy about football is much of what makes the sport dangerous. However, I believe there must be a way to find the art of success and vitality in football, without the driving the level of impact that causes serious risk of head trauma, paralysis and other life-changing injuries.","In my view, the first requirement for success for an entrepreneur is to dream big. The second aspect that prevents entrepreneurs from succeeding is fear of failure.","Humans have always used our intelligence and creativity to improve our existence. After all, we invented the wheel, discovered how to make fire, invented the printing press and found a vaccine for polio.","Technology itself is neither good nor bad. People are good or bad.","An entrepreneur is not a person who starts a company, but he is the person who actually solves a problem.","My parents didn't believe in luck. They believed in hard work and in preparing me to take advantage of opportunity. Like many parents, they taught me to be generous but never to depend on the generosity of others.","Great entrepreneurs focus intensely on an opportunity where others see nothing. This focus and intensity helps to eliminate wasted effort and distractions. Most companies die from indigestion rather than starvation, i.e., companies suffer from doing too many things at the same time rather than doing too few things very well.","Successful ventures in business or philanthropy are built around great teams who can help us overcome tremendous challenges - and have the right experiences and relationships to do so.","I have absolutely no idea about space exploration. I'm a software guy. But because I'm a non-expert, I've been able to bring the software concept of modularity into the space sector, which was never done before.","I started off with a company, InfoSpace, with my own funding. The company was listed among the most successful companies and I went on to start Intelius and Moon Express. Now, I focus my time on using the skills of an entrepreneur to solve many of the grand challenges facing us in the areas of education, healthcare, clean water and energy.","I've found that entrepreneurial success usually comes through great execution, simply by doing a superior job of doing the blocking and tackling.","How important is failure - yes, failure - to the health of a thriving, innovative business? So important that Ratan Tata, chairman of India's largest corporation, gives an annual award to the employee who comes up with the best idea that failed.","The real metric of success isn't the size of your bank account. It's the number of lives in whom you might be able to make a positive difference.","In the business world today, failure is apparently not an option. We need to change this attitude toward failure - and celebrate the idea that only by falling on our collective business faces do we learn enough to succeed down the road.","The goal must be to expand ourselves beyond one field of focus and use our improved access to information to solve the very real and extreme economic, environmental, and resource challenges we face as an interconnected, global society.","When you're starting a new business, you don't need to know much about it. A lot of the work is blocking and tackling - it's the same type of stuff no matter what sector you're in.","As a child I experienced firsthand the severe effects of poverty and illiteracy, especially upon women and children. My parents taught me the importance of education and that it was a key to improving an individual's life.","Don't wallow in brainstorming. Time spent fiddling with a business plan or filling up whiteboards with ideas is time that you could spend actually launching your business and seeing if the idea floats. Launching gives you real, solid feedback, instead of the imaginary 'what if' scenarios dreamed up in a conference room.","We begin to change the world when we stimulate long-term prosperity using technology. There is not a problem that's large enough that innovation and entrepreneurship can't solve.","What separates sports from entrepreneurism, however, is that in business we constantly have to overcome undefined and unpredictable challenges. Athletes train for specific events and conditions, whereas entrepreneurs generally have little idea what they will encounter along the way.","Success is not about how much money we have in the bank, but it's about how many peoples' lives we have impacted through it. Success is experienced when we do things which are never done before.","Early versions of Microsoft Word left a lot to be desired. However, to the company's credit, it quickly learned where Word fell short, made the necessary changes, and repeatedly introduced new versions of the software.","Go where your customers take you! For example, did you know that Sony's first product was a rice cooker? Since abandoning the rice cooker, it has merely managed to become the world's biggest consumer electronics company.","The U.S. has spent billions of dollars on educating and supporting teachers or developing curricula but no resources are applied to 'improving the brain' that a student brings to the classroom.","Neuroplasticity research showed that the brain changes its very structure with each different activity it performs, perfecting its circuits so it is better suited to the task at hand.","Great entrepreneurs focus intensely on an opportunity where others see nothing.","I've given a lot of talks over the years on the subject of entrepreneurship. The first thing I find I have to do is to dispel the persistent myth that entrepreneurial success is all about innovative thinking and breakthrough ideas.","It is always great to see technology leaders like Ginni Rometty, Marissa Mayer, and Meg Whitman breaking through as a new generation of leaders.","Any time you make more than a couple of friends at an event, I think that you actually made no friends.","Our education system was developed for an industrial era where we could teach certain skills to our children and they were able to use these skills for the rest of their lives working productively in an industry.","Today, people idolize athletes and celebrities - and yes, highly successful and visionary business people like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, but not the innovators who perhaps have not seen such high-flying levels of success. Can anyone name the inventors of GPS, which has such a huge impact on our lives today?","True philanthropy requires a disruptive mindset, innovative thinking and a philosophy driven by entrepreneurial insights and creative opportunities.","Teaching children about entrepreneurship is much like imparting any other skill or piece of knowledge. You will provide them with ways to experience how entrepreneurship works, and you guide them toward the subjects or areas they seem to show an interest in.","Don't let expertise fool you into seeing false boundaries or underestimating those with wild dreams.","In life, we all struggle and strive to make progress. When will you know you've reached success? A billion dollars is a good sign, but there's a better one - humility.","Successful entrepreneurs find the balance between listening to their inner voice and staying persistent in driving for success - because sometimes success is waiting right across from the transitional bump that's disguised as failure.","When you experience a failure as a leader, don't hide it - talk about it. Your missed opportunity will encourage others to take risks.","It's really easy to create a $1 billion company - you just have to solve a $10 billion problem.","Education should not be about building more schools and maintaining a system that dates back to the Industrial Revolution. We can achieve so much more, at unmatched scale with software and interactive learning.","We are now living in a fast paced technological era where every skill that we teach our children becomes obsolete in the 10 to 15 years due to exponentially growing technological advances.","Why is it that our young kids all across America can solve the most complex problems in a video game involving executive decision making and analytical thinking, yet we accept the fact that they can't add or read?","I have seen humility in many of the finest leaders I have met the world over. And indeed, it is embodied in the warm, engaging and quintessentially successful spirit of Sir Richard Branson.","I've been an entrepreneur all my life, and my recent focus is on finding entrepreneurial solutions to address global challenges in healthcare and education.","I believe that entrepreneurs play an unmatched role and the accelerating pace of innovation is transforming the face of global challenges. You must think about the solution differently when you're trying to impact 1 billion people rather than affecting 1 million people.","Governments take too long to get things done and there are far too many varied interests at stake. If you were starting a business today and needed a partner, you would never choose a large bureaucratic institution like the government.","I believe that incentivized prizing is the best solution to help unlock the answers to the some of the profound problems that plague our planet.","My children have been learning lessons about entrepreneurship since they were in kindergarten, and these lessons are paying off: even though they are only 22, 18, and 15, they have already collectively launched three nonprofit organizations and several new businesses.","'Being green' is commendable, but I hope that people don't take too much pride and self-adoration because they shut off the water when they brushed their teeth. The truth of the matter is, conservation alone will do little to save our planet.","All the conservation efforts in the world won't be enough to make a dent in the oncoming sustainability crisis our planet faces.","Once humans traded their hunter-gatherer existences for more settled communities, we began a quest to make our lives better and more comfortable, but we've also been sucking precious finite resources from our environment ever since.","Athletes at all ages are bigger and stronger than ever before. And they are being encouraged - sometimes even incentivized, as we recently learned was the case on at least one National Football League team - to play to injure.","The United States of America became the envy of the world because we welcomed the best and brightest minds from anywhere on the planet and gave them the opportunity to succeed.","I grew up poor in India, and there were days when we struggled to find food and other basic necessities. Our mother worked odds and ends jobs to keep the family together and educate us.","I came to the United States in the early '80s and was welcomed with open arms and given the opportunity to pursue my dreams. God has been very kind to us. My family and I are fortunate enough to be successful and we feel a tremendous responsibility and obligation to give back to our great country.","I worked for Microsoft until 1996, till I had a different angle to view life. I wanted to be an entrepreneur and control my own destiny.","I understand human needs. I grew up where far too many people lived day to day without elemental needs like food and shelter.","My father was a civil servant in northern India where I was born. As a boy I saw the dire effects of poverty and illiteracy, especially on women and children. It often seemed that the only thing separating me from them was luck.","Because I was poor I had one special advantage. When you are poor, and basic survival is your concern, you have no alternative but to be an entrepreneur. You must take action to survive just as you must take action to seize an opportunity.","The most frequently asked question I hear first-time entrepreneurs ask is, 'How do I know when to launch my product?' The answer, more often than not, should be: 'Now!'","There are as many ways to help another human being as there are people in need of help. For some, the urgent need is as basic as food and water. For others, it is an opportunity to develop a talent, realize an idea, and reach one's full potential.","Helping people boost themselves out of poverty is the best way to make a lasting positive difference in a person's life.","My own philanthropic efforts have always included an educational element, whether it's expanding opportunities to educate a promising mind or extending the brain's ability to learn.","Growing up in India, I knew all I needed to change the world was one good opportunity, and I prepared myself for it. When that opportunity came - in the form of the chance to earn an engineering degree - I was ready.","As a young boy growing up in rural India, most of what I knew of the world was what I could see around me. But each night, I would look at the Moon - it was impossibly far away, yet it held a special attraction because it allowed me to dream beyond my village and country, and think about the rest of the world and space.","I believe we need a more opportunistic and democratic approach to lunar exploration, now that we're shifting from U.S. government-sponsored space exploration to private expeditions.","Call it the Tiger Mom effect: In the business world today, failure is apparently not an option.","Apple Computer would not have reached its current peak of success if it had feared to roll the dice and launch products that didn't always hit the mark. In the mid-1990s, the company was considered washed up, Steve Jobs had departed, and a string of lackluster product launches unrelated to the company's core business.","Just as physical exercise is a well-known and well-accepted means to improve health for anyone, regardless of age or background, so can the brain be put 'into shape' for optimal learning.","We owe it to our children to equip them with all the capabilities they'll need to thrive in the limitless world beyond the classrooms.","Sometimes a faint voice based on instinct resonates far more strongly than overpowering logic.","We, as entrepreneurs, can be held responsible for our actions every single day, not every election cycle.","The capital goes wherever the opportunities are.","If you create great opportunities, people around the world will come support your dream.","Sometimes we never see what failure is and often fail to recognize it.","If we want to impact hundreds - or millions - of people, we have to do things differently. If we look at the problem as an infrastructural problem, we cannot make an impact because it requires a lot of effort. But when we convert this problem into a knowledge problem, suddenly the problem is manageable.","Unfettered, creative, and enthusiastic entrepreneurship is one of the hallmarks of American life, and it has allowed us to attract the best and brightest to this country.","I am really happy to see the number of entrepreneurs in India - not only because of the ideas they have but also because of the passion at which their ideas are put across.","As fathers, we all have great lessons to teach our children.","I am proud of my kids and happy to brag about their achievements. Their success has been an immense source of happiness for me.","If you are passionate about entrepreneurship like I am, you too can instill this passion in your children.","The entrepreneurial bug had already bitten my son Ankur by the time he got to college. As a lifelong entrepreneur, I certainly didn't want to dampen his enthusiasm by telling him he couldn't do it, but I also wanted to make sure it was balanced with the proper attention to his studies.","The digital revolution has also meant a revolution in access to information. This puts more power and knowledge into the hands of nonexperts.","Open-source encyclopedias such as Wikipedia and search engines such as Google and Bing, which people can tap into anytime and anywhere via computers and smart phones, put a world of knowledge at our fingertips at a lower cost than ever before.","Experts are able to identify patterns related to a specific problem relevant to their area of knowledge. But because nonexperts lack that base of knowledge, they are forced to rely more on their brain's ability for abstraction rather than specificity.","Successful entrepreneurs always give 100% of their efforts to everything they do.","I am convinced that only by applying the values of an entrepreneur to philanthropy will you ever be able to meet the needs of the greatest number of people.","Philanthropists can learn important lessons from business entrepreneurs. They both spend their time solving problems. And to be successful, they both must overcome physical challenges and create self-sustaining operations. And ultimately, they must allow people to take action for their own benefit.","Entrepreneurial Philanthropy is not just a philosophy or a dream. It is a promise that philanthropy is at its best when it is founded on entrepreneurial zest and agility.","Investors are right to demand a clear path to self-sustainability from every business they invest in, and I believe we should ask for the same from philanthropy.","If you think something is impossible, then it certainly is... for you.","I may have managed to build a successful technology startup that had gone public by the time my three kids hit their 13th birthdays, but don't think that bought my wife and me any special respect from our teenagers.","I'm very, very used to hearing no - repeatedly! - and through my experience founding startups, I've learned to view those two little letters not as a final roadblock but as a problem to be solved.","When your child comes to you at a young age and declares he or she is passionate about this or that, the natural tendency for many parents, out of love, is to simply support that decision. That's the path of least resistance, but it's not necessarily the best path, in my opinion.","If you don't know much about the field, you're able to ask a set of questions that an expert would never ask, and that allows you a very different thought process and a fresh approach."],"Naveen Tewari":["Bubbles are created when something positive is happening. People get over-enthusiastic about it and take the tide higher than it should go. The reality is bubbles are required to create an industry.","The most important lesson to remember is that failure is inevitable, but so is success, so rebound.","Our business is strong and enjoys high margins.","In tough times, one has to see if the fundamentals of the business are good or not.","InMobi is passionate about pushing the limits of business and mobile technology.","Amobee has an enviable track record of success supporting the world's leading brands with their cutting edge, end-to-end mobile advertising solution.","In combining forces, InMobi will now be able to offer Amobee's clients greater ROI and reach.","Google created the intent graph. Facebook created the social graph. We are creating the emotional graph.","Advertising has always been about creating awareness. We started to question that logic. Discovery-led consumption is where we are headed. We are bringing window shopping to the mobile platform.","We have the capital, the resources, and the technology that we need to build a mobile advertising platform across the planet.","I come from a middle-class family, where you grow up thinking about government service. But when I went to Harvard, I saw that entrepreneurs and business leaders were just like me. It gave me a feeling that I could also do such things.","One of the biggest motivation for me and my co-founder was to learn and see what is happening in the market, see what next generation of entrepreneurs are doing. This has been the biggest motivation to investing in start-ups.","Capital never builds great products.","Frankly, as an entrepreneur, you can do only one thing and be a part of it, but through investing in different ventures, you can be a part of something new and what others are trying to build.","I am not a big fan of investors asking for revenues upfront. Investors seeking numbers are being too myopic. However, I personally believe in creating a product with clarity in mind on how one thinks revenues can trickle in.","If you look at the direction that the world is taking from an advertising and marketing point of view, it is significantly becoming a world that's all about video and all about doing things programmatically. Now what AerServ has is best in-class technology in the form of video programmatic... our acquisition of them gives us that capability.","I eventually think its going to be the consumer who controls his own data.","Advertising has to be contextual, as the potential in 'push' marketing is fairly limited and is largely viewed as spam. Thus there is a need to get into 'permission' marketing and 'pull' marketing to deliver value to marketers.","However hard you might try, you can never understand a market like a local person would.","A lot of coordinated approaches are required to make a global operation work.","Our offices across the globe may not be very similar in terms of the way they look, but they are very similar culturally.","You get to learn so much while working in another country.","The Internet eco-system should be such that users should not pay for Internet connection, content, or anything that is basic.","Access to Internet and content should be free for users which can get accommodated by advertisements.","Capital will follow where great talents go.","Drying up of capital has different consequences in different environments.","After multiple failures, when I tasted success, I was at my creative best - the 'jugaadu'-best.","When I started InMobi, I was on the road raising funds. I faced 20 rejections. But when I got the funds, they came from best venture capitalists.","I know, it sounds generic and is a cliche, but coming from a middle class family in Kanpur, it was always the neighbourhood opinions which mattered.","In my viewpoint, experience is grossly overrated.","The world has many very smart people who are doing interesting and different things, and there is no better way to learn than to interact with them.","The primary motivation for me is to learn.","For a company to be successful, it's not just about ideas. It's also about luck. And everything else coming together.","I realized that if I had to work with others, I had to align with their vision.","One of the challenges of having exceptionally high quality talent is that they're constantly restless, and they're constantly on the lookout for opportunities.","As an Indian company, to go outside India and motivate people, have them align to our vision, and get them excited about what an Indian company can do was a hard thing to pull off.","We knew we had to think global and think big. Most companies that are emerging don't do that.","I always believe in backing up a team that is super passionate and loves to work with each other.","NestAway is a disruptive product creating a win-win opportunity, not just for direct stakeholders like owners and tenants but for the society at large by making cities safer, especially for young women.","Of the three largest Internet markets - the U.S., India, and China - you will increasingly see Indian and Chinese companies partner.","For me, whether I have money or not, it is far more important that there is an intent behind a cause that's pure and can change the lives of certain people. If that's there, then you will be able to get all the resources required.","Nasscom has a big mandate - a lot of things come under their umbrella.","Just do what you love.","I have the same breakfast I have been having for many years - oats with fruits and dry fruits.","We were told that building a product company in India is impossible, as there wasn't enough talent available. But we survived, thrived, and grew despite a whole lot of frowns and thumbs down.","InMobi will play a critical role in shaping the future.","When we failed and pivoted our business from mKhoj to InMobi or when we did not get any trained people with the required skillsets, as we were the first in the industry, and on many such instances in our journey, we would think of giving up every other day.","As technologists, we all write code.","I realized that the journey of entrepreneurship can often be a lonely one. Not everyone wants to believe in or support your vision, and every entrepreneur faces this moment of truth. It's hard to walk away but harder to persevere.","As an entrepreneur, you're going to get 100 rejections and one yes. That one yes will give you enough and more kick in life to continue and remain motivated.","As long as you're clear about your goal, failures don't mean it's not going to work.","Anything edgy won't see instant success. That's why one will have to learn to wait. You're going to see a lot of failures.","As long as you're a company that makes profits, all's good.","Good people do fundamental work because they believe in the work.","We started paying everyone 100% bonuses. We removed any sort of performance management system where you put down your goals for the quarter, or the year, then try measuring against those goals because when you are dealing with innovation, that has no meaning.","In a market where funding is hard to come by, if you're scaled already, then you are in a brilliant position because nobody is going to catch up with you.","Bengaluru's traffic does not allow scope for cycling regularly, but I brave the roads occasionally and take the cycle out to work.","Team sports is the best for bonding. These sports lessons are also true for startups. You want to be at the top of every endeavour, but you win some and you lose some. As a team, however, you always pump each other up and move forward.","For most people, hobbies are not something we can take up full-time.","For me, my career and passion is InMobi. So I hardly get stressed working for it.","In 2007, I was living in San Francisco. I came out of business school, and I was very keen on doing something with a small company. I felt that the market, in general, in mobile phones was just going to explode.","PC Internet advertising and mobile advertising - there are some key differences. One, the ability to target is phenomenally high in the mobile space because the information... that one has about the kinds of things that you're doing on the phone is better.","I don't consider my competition to be companies but entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is the freedom to take your own decisions, and that's what we offer."],"Navi Rawat":["I think it's a mistake to go after someone just based on looks. But I always respond to people who don't act that interested in me.","In college, I had a crush on one of my professors. I used to bat my eyelashes and coo at him. He didn't respond at all, which made me like him even more.","I did most of my schooling in Miami.","It has been a great experience to act in Hollywood movies with actors like Ben Kingsley.","I love coming to India, and I find the people out here very warm and social as compared to people in the U.S.","I have grown up watching Bollywood movies, and I would love to act in them.","I find the songs and dances in Hindi films fascinating, and I know I will do justice to them, as I am a trained dancer."],"Navid Negahban":["You just need to put yourself in someone else's shoes and then see how they feel and then you will understand why they are reacting or why they are behaving the way that they are behaving. We need to be fair.","I grew up during the Revolution of Iran and the war between Iran and Iraq. The things that I saw. The impact. How it changes you. How it changes the way you look at the world.","When I was I kid, there were so many different things that I wanted to be. As an actor, I get a chance to be all of those things, at least for a couple of days, which is fun.","I speak Farsi, German, Dari, and I understand Turkish, but I haven't used it since 1985, so I'm a bit rusty.","I left Iran back in 1985. I lived in Turkey for a while, then I went to Germany. I joined a theater company there, and we toured the country.","Before 9/11, I was playing a wide range of characters. I would play a lover, a cop, a father. As long as I could create the illusion of the character, the part was given to me. But after 9/11, something changed. We became the villains, the bad guys. I don't mind to play the bad guy as long as the bad guy has a base.","I think we're always intrigued by things we're not familiar with.","I lived with a German family. I learned about schnitzel from Ritta Seiffer. When she cooked she'd get the oil really hot so that it sealed everything and in the middle was very juicy. That's the secret to a great schnitzel.","As an actor sometimes we sit and wait for projects to be handed to us and we don't really work. We expect our agents and managers to know who we are and to see who we are and offer us a part or send us out and submit us.","As actors, if we are truthful to ourselves and we know what we can do and what we cannot do and just go after it, there are possibilities out there. If you don't try, you won't find out if you get them or not.","I like 'Breaking Bad' and 'Game of Thrones.' I like that era. I like that fantasy world.","I grew up on Harold Lloyd, Charles Chaplin, and Buster Keaton, and those were the ones who inspired me.","I like 'Shameless.' The first season I just watched it straight through. I literally didn't get up. I just had to finish it."],"Navjot Singh Sidhu":["Anybody can pilot a ship when the sea is calm.","Nothing ventured, nothing gained. And venture belongs to the adventurous.","You can't play a symphony alone, it takes an orchestra to play it.","You got to choose between tightening your belt or losing your pants.","A fallen lighthouse is more dangerous than a reef.","Beware of the naked man who offers you his shirt.","I have seen many ladies displaying different styles and different styles displaying ladies.","We'll take the cake with the red cherry on top.","Experience is like a comb that life gives you when you are bald.","One who doesn't throw the dice can never expect to score a six.","There is light at the end of the tunnel for India, but it's that of an oncoming train which will run them over.","The cat with gloves catches no mice.","When you are dining with a demon, you got to have a long spoon.","Nobody travels on the road to success without a puncture or two.","Wickets are like wives. You never know what to expect from them.","It's like the brooding hen sitting over a china egg.","Age has been the perfect fire extinguisher for flaming youth.","A revolutionary idea is usually one with its sleeves rolled up.","Even a cock crows over his own dunghill.","He will fight a rattlesnake and give it the first two bites too.","I am a sepoy and will follow the guidance of my leaders.","If the heavens throw you dates, you got to keep your mouth open.","The ball whizzes past like a bumblebee and the Indians are in the sea.","The Indians are finding the gaps like a pin in a haystack.","The third umpires should be changed as often as nappies and for the same reason.","After marriage, the other man's wife looks more beautiful.","We are all Adam's children - it's just the skin that makes all the difference."],"Nawal El Saadawi":["When you are intelligent and beautiful you face a lot of problems. If you are beautiful and stupid then it's easy.","To me, 'beauty' means to be natural, creative, honest - to say the truth.","The feminists who are aware of the effects of patriarchy realize that we are all in the same boat from the dangers of patriarchy, and that the oppression of women is universal.","Unity is power; without unity women cannot fight for their rights anywhere.","To be creative means to connect. It's to abolish the gap between the body, the mind and the soul, between science and art, between fiction and nonfiction.","Plastic surgery is a postmodern veil.","Home is where you are appreciated, safe and protected, creative, and where you are loved - not where you are put in prison.","If you do not love yourself, well, you cannot do anything well, that's my philosophy.","I am very much against makeup and high heels and all that we inherit as 'beauty.'","Education should be totally secular. I am not telling people not to believe in God, but it should be a personal matter which should be done at home.","When you have increasing power of religious groups, oppression of women increases. Women are oppressed in all religions.","What makes revolutionary thought unique is its clarity and dignity, and its clear grasp of freedom and justice: simple, clear words that are understood without the need for any help from elite writers or thinkers.","My three husbands were afraid of me. I am a very powerful woman.","The family code in Egypt is one of the worst family codes in the Arab world. Polygamy. The husband is having absolute power over the family.","A lot of women are afraid of loneliness, so when they see a woman who can live alone, then they think, 'Hmm, I can do that.' But you need an example, and that is why I am proud to say I have divorced three husbands.","I am becoming more radical with age. I have noticed that writers, when they are old, become milder. But for me it is the opposite. Age makes me more angry.","Women in most countries have not achieved much, because they can't be liberated under the patriarchal, capitalist, imperialist and military system that determines the way we live now, and which is governed by power, not justice, by false democracy, not real freedom.","I've participated in many demonstrations since I was a child. When I was at medical college, I was fighting King Farouk, then British colonization, against Nasser, against Sadat who pushed me into prison, Mubarak who pushed me into exile. I never stopped.","I don't think that people in power can be convinced by words or articles. They will never give it up by choice.","War criminals in the U.S. and Israel are not punished: no international court has the courage to put them on trial.","Whenever I go to New York or any European country, they say: 'Nawal, why don't you get a facelift?' I tell them, 'I am proud of my wrinkles. Every wrinkle on my face tells the story of my life. Why should I hide my age?'","When we live in a world that is very unjust, you have to be a dissident.","We here in Egypt are fed up with U.S. colonialism.","In history, the millions win; that is democracy.","You know, I look to myself mainly as a creative writer all my life and a medical doctor.","Home to me is the world because my books have been translated into more than 30 languages."],"Nawazuddin Siddiqui":["In Mumbai, you have to act in real life, too.","Looks is a matter of perception. At Cannes, Europeans think I am good looking, while in India, I am not.","I love observing people. Each face tells so many stories. It lets me understand emotions, and that, in turn, helps me apply my skills as an actor.","I feel satisfied after achieving something difficult.","There is nothing called negative character. The negativity and positivity exists in all of us.","Behind every easy role, there is a lot of hard work that goes in.","Most people go to ashrams or retreats to destress and rejuvenate themselves. But I come back to my roots, the place where I spent half my life. And when I return, I spend time in the farms, eating a stalk of sugarcane, driving a tractor, and chilling with childhood friends.","I am a five-foot six-inch, dark, ordinary-looking man. People didn't imagine that I would make it.","I won't give the credit to 'good fortune.' Whatever I have achieved is because of my hard work and passion.","It's very difficult switching over from one character to another.","I can go back to poverty if a situation comes. I have sailed through the worst days of my life, and I am prepared for any crisis.","Back in 1993, I was studying in Delhi, and I had a girlfriend. I had never touched a girl before that in my entire life. One day, I decided to go out with her to a garden. We were sitting beside each other, and I just glanced around to see if anyone was looking at us, and I put my hand over hers. I thought love started in this way.","I believe everyone is mad when they are in love, and I don't think that can ever end.","I found the brick-making process fascinating - how, after being burnt, the brick would come out strong. I liked to sit on the stack of bricks and look as far as I could. I'd do the same at a hillock near my school - just sit on top at leisure and enjoy the feeling of being on top of the world.","When someone is looking at me, I feel they are looking at someone standing behind me, not at me.","'Freaky Ali' is not a heavy film. It's a simple but inspiring film. It will inspire those who want to go from zero to hundred. People who have made an effort to achieve success from nothing will be able to connect to the character.","If one line about the film excites me, I try to take it forward.","I am from a family of farmers from Budhana near Muzaffarnagar.","When I had no money, I would find out which friend had work and money at that point in time and would go and stay with him for a week. All of us theatre guys did that.","Even though I hated doing farming and wanted to just get out of the village, I would work from 5 in the morning till 5 in the evening.","There was electricity in our village only for 2-3 hours a day, so all my life, I studied under a lamp.","'Freaky Ali' may look like an easy role to others, but it is not easy.","For me, as an actor, there is no commercial or independent or art cinema. For me, it's a character that is given by the director. And it is a task for me that I have to fulfill it to the best of my ability regardless of the kind of film that it is.","I still can't believe it when people say I am a celebrity.","Being a recognised face has its problems. I miss the freedom to go anywhere I want to.","I interact with journalists all the time, and I note how they behave.","I knew I would get offers to play the villain after 'Kick,' and I had already decided to reject all of them.","The success of 'Kick' will help in the marketing of other small budget independent films I have acted in.","A big blockbuster like 'Kick' expands the audience for my films and makes it easier to promote them.","Background scores allow me an absolute flight of the imagination, and I travel in my mind's eye. I do not like the scores to have vocal notes, because they act as a limitation to these flights of fancy.","Before 'Raman Raghav 2.0,' I played a criminal in 'Badlapur.' Though the character was innocent, he was not correctly interpreted by some sections of the audience.","'Ali' is the story of a lower middle-class golfer who becomes a champion. I find the game very interesting and would like to continue playing it regularly after the movie is wrapped up.","I don't want my work to be heavy. The challenge is to make it interesting and engaging, keeping in mind the need for method acting. This is what I have learnt from Bharat Muni's 'Natya Shastra' and from the Russian theatre legend Stanislavsky.","As far as Raman Raghav is concerned, he is ruthless.","I think there is no racism in this film industry. They are only in need of talent, though it takes time; but, if you are talented, you will get your due. I am thankful to be part of this industry.","My job is to work hard and be honest with my character, and that's in my control. I can only try to give my best performance.","Love stories should be relatable.","At first, I was hesitant when it came to giving autographs, thinking that I am not even worth giving one. But slowly I got over that phase.","I don't believe in the 100 crore club.","I feel happy that I am being honoured for doing films of my own liking.","After graduating from National School of Drama, I started doing theatre in Delhi. But there was not much money in Hindi theatre.","Coming from a small town, I didn't have big dreams. My biggest ambition was to find a job for myself.","Rituparno Ghosh is a legendary director, and I happen to be a huge fan of his.","How long will we keep making films where hero-heroine is dancing around trees?","I have seen many teachers in real life, which come from the same background and morality and treat their profession like just another one rather than a noble profession.","Like the way we get to know about the society of Korea, Iran, and other countries through their films, people will get to know about our country. Our films are a mirror of our society.","I would be happy if people just called me an actor.","I used to clean the sets and serve tea to the artistes.","Bollywood has always pampered heroes and treated actors as second class citizens. But, of late, it has realised that there has to be space for actors who can connect with people.","I was introduced to cinema by C-grade films that played in my village, Budhana, in UP. Only films by Dada Kondke, Mahendra Sandhu, and Kanti Shah were available.","I used to be the best comic actor in my batch. Everyone knew that my comic timing was impeccable.","There are thousands of ways to make people laugh - satire, black comedy, slapstick.","The village I come from is the most ruthless, lawless land one can encounter.","'Haraamkhor' is a low budget film. We are not worried about the box office because our film is already in profit. It's got a strong content that will reach people's heart.","It's not necessary that every film has to hit Rs 100 crore box office, or the Rs 50 crore budget. If the film makes double of its project budget, we consider that a hit, and that also means that the film is in profit.","My character should not be ordinary, cliched, and if I feel that it's difficult to do this character, I take up that challenge to get into his character.","When people say I'm a star, I don't believe it.","One should go to the line through the character. You should see their lifestyle in the way they speak.","The easier it looks on screen, the more hard work goes into making it so.","My character in the first instalment of 'GOW' was very shy and reserved. It was completely different from 'Kahaani,' where I played a no-nonsense cop. And in the second instalment of 'GOW,' it is again very different.","I have fallen in love so many times. If one relationship ended, I would search for another girl. I was always madly in love with all the girls that I dated.","The difference between an actor and a star is the budget and the overall presentation of a film.","I am trying every genre.","I am very confident about my work because I have worked very hard.","Kabir Khan is that rare director who manages to merge Bollywood formula with a good story.","If I am comfortable with my co-star, then that always shows in my performances.","Kabir Khan is a director who goes out of his way to make his actors comfortable. He's very chilled out. He makes the environment on set very casual and friendly.","I decided to be a part of 'Bajrangi'... because I felt that it tells a very relevant story.","I was determined to be an actor and make a name in the industry, and hence, I did.","I don't want to take names, but there are some people who get everything served on a platter. This is a movie, this is your role, and you have to do it. Some people have to strive so hard to reach where they have and want to.","I have seen people climbing up and down the ladder of success, and I learnt a lot from them.","In my head, I believed even though I am an actor, there was no need to dance. That's not me.","I always thought golf was a game reserved for the rich and the elite... But it's a misconception. It's a highly technical game, and it's a game that you can play and master alone. You require sharp skills for it, and you can play the game alone.","Many actors come and disappear into oblivion. But not Salman Khan.","I grew fond of acting rather late. And that was because I was not getting any job. I had a few friends in Delhi who were associated with theater. They took me to see some plays in Delhi and Baroda. That led me to believe the I could also act. And it was after that I joined National School of Drama in 1993.","Muzaffarnagar is 40 kilometers from my village. So I used to see films if I was able to save money and on special occasions like Eid, Diwali.","Prior to joining NSD, I was briefly associated with a small theater group in Delhi called Sakshi. Saurabh Shukla, Manoj Bapayee were my seniors in that group. I performed a few supporting roles in Sakshi plays.","At NSD, I had an amazing experience learning everything from stagecraft to western drama and Shakespeare, Maxim Gorky, Anton Chekov."],"Naya Rivera":["My passion for music is one of my greatest loves.","I find it's really hard for anybody to meet anyone. I'm not big on dates anyways. I still have to work that out.","It's on my bucket list, to get in a real fight.","I used to be a workout fiend and I was so unhappy because I wanted to eat what I wanted to eat. So now if I know I have to be in a bikini, I'll obviously watch what I eat for a week.","I love hot yoga. I go to a sculpt class with weights. That's really good for the core and it's obviously super hot. I love cardio bar. I'm not a big gym fan, so I like to go to classes.","I will admit to hoarding beauty products. I'm a beauty lady.","If you think back to your first love, you always remember them and little things always remind you of them.","For people to even think that I'd be considered or a good candidate for a supporting actress nomination is mind blowing to me.","I am half Puerto Rican, a quarter German and a quarter black. That was always a big issue for me - being mixed race - because casting directors tended to be very like, 'OK, are you Hispanic for this role?' 'Or is she going to be African American?'","From the time I was 16 to really up until turning 21, the roles were really, really few and far between. I had people say that I just wasn't a good singer. They didn't know what to do with me; I would never fit in any markets. I almost quit acting altogether.","Honestly, I never thought I'd actually be playing a teen lesbian. I didn't think it was going to go this far. But I'm glad that it did, because there have been a lot of fans who have expressed that they've been going through similar situations in their lives.","Getting hit on by both genders is such a champagne problem.","I think it's important to be able to say that you did live a normal life and struggled to make ends meet. It all has to do with work ethic and how I apply myself to my awesome job now. I've always been used to working because I've been working since I was four.","I want to play Lena Horne because I've always been fascinated with her. Her talent was astounding and more than that, her life story is incredible."],"Nayef Al-Rodhan":["Realism implicated that imperialism and imperialist conquests or prestige can be pursued as part of the animus dominandi, the desire to dominate, which is the social force that determines political activity.","The history of Israel-Palestine conflict cannot be understood without its underlying emotional meanders. The emotional frameworks of the loss of Palestine for the Arab-Islamic world touched deep scars that go back to the Crusades, symbolizing a proof of Arab-Islamic decay, political impotence, and perceived (British/French) betrayal and antagonism.","Cognitive neuroscience, and social theorists from Weber to Bourdieu, have recognized that humans act, most of the time, habitually, not reflectively. Both at intrastate and inter-states levels, habits play critical roles in mitigating uncertainty, providing a sense of order, and entrench patterns of cooperation or enmity.","Mimicking the intricacies of the human brain, a neuro-inspired computer would work in a fashion similar to the way neurons and synapses communicate. It could potentially learn or develop memory.","The moment of the print button for biology is nearing. Effectively, this could also mean that in a not-too-distant future, smart pharmacology will permit us to receive a continuous supply of antidepressants or neuroenhancers every time our dopamine level drops.","Genome-based treatment, based on wider and cheaper availability of genome data, will provide new ways to customize the therapeutic protocol and enhance our control over diseases and medical treatment.","In a hyper-capitalist environment dominated by media giants, the means available to independent journalism have narrowed considerably.","Governments must ensure that the power of blogs is cultivated and implemented in collaborative ways, with a view to preserve peace and human dignity.","The ways in which readers encounter and relate to information is dramatically influenced by their education as well as their awareness of the pitfalls relating to the information source."],"Nayvadius Cash":["I know I haven't always done things the right way. I'm just trying to reflect on how to make myself better, how to become a better man, a better father, a better person, a better artist.","My obsession with outer space is my way of being different. I make astronaut music. It takes an astronaut so long to get to space - that's how long it takes to catch up on my music.","I'm just really a free spirit. You gotta be like that. 'Cause life ain't that complicated. It's only that complicated when you make it that way. I just wanna wake up and move with the way it goes. If it's meant to happen, it will happen.","The weirdest place I ever actually woke up in was a villa on the beach in Mexico. It was burning hot, and there were all these crabs walking around me. But I was feeling good, so I went with the vibe.","You get inspiration from craziest places. It's just about being creative. You gotta step outside that box, you know what I'm saying, to reach the people. You never know who can feel it; who it can connect to.","You make music to change the radio, not make music for the radio.","The most fun moments are being on the stage and seeing how the crowd reacts to your music. The energy of the crowd that makes you just want to go in and keep doing it and be a part of this forever.","I don't read blogs. I'm living the life they're writing about. So why read about it?","I've always been into fashion since I was a kid. I love fashion. I appreciate it. I just enjoy dressing up and getting all the new sneakers and all the hot exclusive clothes - I did even when I was young.","I gotta have my long trench coats, a nice scarf for the winter time when you're walking around, and some nice fitted jeans to go with the trench coats.","I feel like guitar explains a lot. You can just listen to a guitar without any lyrics over it; you can just feel what kind of track it is. If it's pain... you can feel it. It sets the mood.","I wanna make my imprint in the game as far as music - hip-hop, and just music, period. 'Cause I come from hip-hop, that's my background, but I'm not gonna let that limit me from where I can go.","I take a little bit from everybody and add that to my life to make me, me. I wanna be nobody else but Future. When you look at me, I want you to say, 'Future.' The way I talk, the way I dress, there's nobody in the world but me.","Sometimes it's hard to open up about your personal life, your relationship because you always want the music to be in the forefront. You want the music to be the biggest carrier of everything that you represent.","I don't just write hits for myself, or for other artists, or to just be writing it. I write it because I was born to do this. I was given this gift, and I'm making the most of my opportunity.","'I Won' is not a love song. It's just me uplifting women in general. I'm giving women the power to treat themselves as a trophy - to show that and know it in yourself and be confident - because when they do that, whoever they're with is winning.","Big Rube was on my first album and some of my mixtapes. His words are so powerful. I want to speak every word he says into existence. I wanna be a part of that! I wanna be a part of greatness. His wordplay is great to me.","At times, I think, 'What would I rather be doing than music?' That's what you have to ask yourself, if you feel like you need to be somewhere else... But there's nothing else I want to do more than music. That's why I stay in the booth.","Future's not everybody. The people who are taking my style are like my babies. I've got a tribe of kids that want to be like me... But I understand why people want to imitate the things I do. They're dope. It comes naturally to me. My fans can expect greatness. If I wasn't me, I would want to be me.","I like all types of women. I accept them as they are when they come into my life... But I'm not a romantic. I'm just up-front. I like to be a part of something real, not make-believe. I tell women to tell me the truth, to just lay it out. Let me be the judge and decide if I want you around or not. Let me have my choice.","Rihanna takes risks, and I love a woman who takes risks. It just goes to show you have your own mind and your own way of thinking.","Where I know I wanna go is being consistent on business, and that's just making another artist, my clothing line - capitalizing off the moment. I wanna be consistently doing that - capitalizing off every move I make.","G-Rock from the Westside, from Allen Temple. He gave my name, The Future; he was like, 'Man, you the future.' Just stuck with the name.","I know melody. I know rhythm; I know bass guitar; I know the piano. I know everything about music that helps build the music that go along with creating the whole art form, you know what I'm saying?","I can't leave home without certain movies. 'The Godfather' is a big one for me. And I've gotta have my beats so I can write new music.","I feel like I'm doing something in Atlanta that nobody ever did as far as rap. If it happens to end up on the top 40 or the pop charts, it doesn't mean I meant to go pop. It's just where the music took me. It started at the bottom, and it rises.","In Atlanta, there's no limitation to where you can take your music. You can be as creative as you want to be.","I'm always most comfortable in the studio. It's my comfort zone. I love being there, and I love making records.","I was drawn to love songs, but I was just drawn to great music - no matter if it's hip-hop, pop, R&B or whether it's rock n' roll or country. It could be a Garth Brooks song, and if it's a smash, then I'll love the different wordplay and different melodies. That's what I'm a fan of - great music.","My day one fans - my fans from my mix tape days - know my life now. They know where I've been. You don't want to have a disconnection with those fans. You have to give them all of you because they feel like they've known you.","When you're riding with your mom, and you're a kid, you'd listen to 'Dear Mama' and the radio friendly records. I used to sneak and listen to Too $hort.","I was probably 15 when I started going to the studio with the older cats in my neighborhood. They heard me rap outside one time; I was just freestyling. And they invited me to the studio. It's good when you're accepted, no matter what crowd. That's the first step of believing you can do whatever you feel like putting your mind to.","I wouldn't say I'm underrated, but more reserved. Only time will tell, but I've been good so far in being consistent and making hit after hit writing for myself and other artists, from rap to R&B, and being able to make those different records.","I need to let people know who I am and instead of just trying to make great records, just be honest and make it more personal and make it more passionate, to make records with emotion and not be afraid to express that.","I'm putting everything on the line in being able to express myself in a different way than rappers normally do. They might say, 'It's rap' or 'It's R&B,' but I'm stepping outside the box and making music for me and making music for the fans to understand me. I'm going the extra distance to be able to come across different.","I want to let little kids know that no matter what situation they come up in, that they're not exempt from success. All I ever wanted was for people to believe in me and just recognize my potential. I came, I struggled, I made it, I conquered.","My favorite designer has to be Louis Vuitton.","My three wishes are just be respected out the game. I want respect from everybody. And just make a successful clothing line and company. I'm not going to put a number on it. Just to have a great career.","My favorite rappers are, I can't really say. I like Kanye because he's so creative. He'll just do anything. I like what Kanye's bringing to the game. Lil Wayne. I like Wayne.","That's that Dungeon Family ethos: being able to reinvent yourself, stand out and stand alone. Having your own character and having your own image, no matter what they say about you. I want to show my versatility and how diverse I am, how I approach the track, my rhythm, my melodies. It's something different.","If you're doing what you think people might like, rather than doing what you like, people will see through it.","I just want to be an inspiration. I'm a rock star, I'm Future Hendrix.","Every mistake you make allows you to be honest because what's in the dark will come to light, so it's better to be truthful about it.","I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. I wouldn't say musically, though.","The hardest part of fame and success is adapting to the people around you that's changing. It changes the way people look at you from how they used to look at you. They listen to you on the radio, they look at you on TV and when people speak on you in a good light, you have a couple people who hold grudges.","At first, Hendrix went and became a superstar in London, but if he walked past the Apollo in Harlem, no one would know who he was. I'm the hip-hop version of him.","I like to express myself through the clothes that I wear."],"Nazanin Boniadi":["In real life, too, women love to be that girl who tames the bad boy.","It's bizarre to be given an award for being empathetic and kind, which is what we all should be.","Women and girls, men and boys all share the right to live free of violence, which is, unfortunately, experienced by both men and women. Women and girls, however, disproportionately experience violence due to a deeply rooted global culture of gender discrimination.","Our rights are interconnected and inseparable. When freedom of expression is threatened, the rights to freedom of association and assembly, of thought, conscience and religion, are also compromised.","I feel really connected to antiquity for some reason.","I was always fascinated with science, and being Persian, it's instilled in us at a young age to follow something very academic in our career.","The way we remember people, even their beauty is all so subjective and a matter of perspective.","I do think faith is important when it introduces positivity into your life and you see it with love in your heart because there's so many people who unfortunately use faith for detrimental things or to justify detrimental actions.","It's nice to see different dimensions of a character. A love interest and family life are always, I think, important in creating layers and textures.","For me, the struggle for women's human rights began the moment I was born in Tehran at the height of the Iranian Revolution, a time when the status of women was quickly deteriorating.","Artists often become vocal advocates of freedom of expression because we depend on it so heavily in our work. But it is an inalienable right that belongs to everyone on an equal basis.","Despite the fact that Rouhani has been a long-time insider in a government that has committed countless human rights violations, and that he himself called for the execution of peaceful activists in 1999, many people inside and outside Iran are optimistic that he might indeed favor greater respect for the rights of the Iranian people.","Old-school Dire Straits songs are on heavy rotation: 'So Far Away,' 'Romeo and Juliet' and of course 'Sultans of Swing.'","The entertainment industry isn't a line of work encouraged in the Persian culture. When I called my dad to say I wanted to quit medicine, there was about three minutes of silence. I'm not sure he knew what to do with himself!","I retweet Amnesty International tweets a lot. It isn't just, 'This person is incarcerated unjustly.' It's also, 'This person was just released.' Those are the victories we work toward, so if we don't inform people of the victories, it does become doom and gloom.","Belgian chocolate is my weakness. I like over 72 percent cacao, which shows you how much of a dark chocolate snob I am.","For me personally, I'm an activist, so I see a lot of turmoil and heartache in the world and tragedy.","We all know in our hearts that forgiveness is the right thing; it's just a matter of being inspired to reach that place.","How often do we see a Muslim woman who is intelligent and independent, and has a voice of her own and is career-driven, on American TV?","I was very successful, and I graduated with honors. And then I called my dad, who still lives in London, and I said, 'Dad, thanks for college, but I'm going to go act now.' It didn't go over very well.","I always say, as an actress, I get to portray the human condition, but as an activist, I get to change the human condition.","First of all, I'm Middle Eastern; I'm Iranian, so to be playing a leading role in a big Hollywood movie, I think, is possibly one of the first times.","Frances Conroy - brilliant, brilliant actress.","In my role as a spokesperson for Amnesty International U.S.A. and as a supporter of various charitable causes including Unlock Iran, a campaign to release prisoners of conscience in Iran, I have never been faced with the threat of intimidation or arrest.","A celebrated and hugely popular actress in her native Iran, Ahangarani first landed on the radar of the Iranian authorities for her open support of opposition figure Mir-Hossein Mousavi, which led to her arrest in July 2009 in the aftermath of a disputed presidential election in Iran.","The idea that an actress - mostly lauded for her performances in more than a dozen films - somehow represents a threat to Iran's national security is laughable at best. But in Ahangarani's case, far from anything humorous, the allegations have actually resulted in the sober prospect of real prison time.","My human rights activism has been widely met with encouragement and support. Ahangarani should earn plaudits, not only for her cinematic achievements, but also for her humanitarian deeds and her commitment to increased rights and freedoms for all.","To have art suppressed is very dangerous to society.","As far as the 2009 elections go, there has been a serious crackdown on human rights in Iran, a clampdown on the media and the wrongful imprisonment of journalists. So it seems what's happening is the government is going after people who have a voice, people who change society or public opinion.","In 2013, I started playing Fara Sherazi on 'Homeland.' I love playing her, not just because she's a strong woman, but because for the first time, a Muslim woman is being portrayed on television as a regular person, rather than a cliche or collection of stereotypes.","It's tougher for women than men in Hollywood, period, if you ask me. As with most professions, women have generally not found equality with men when it comes to income and influence. There aren't as many female directors, producers, and writers, which translates to fewer complex roles for women.","I decided to start acting in my mid-twenties. I studied pre-med, and I have a bachelor's degree in Biology, so when I decided to pursue a different career, I got a lot of, 'What on earth are you doing?' But, I gave myself a year and thought, 'You know what, I'm going to just beat the odds.'","I was born in Iran, which has a predominantly Muslim population, and I have relatives who are devout Muslims, so I know what it means to be judged based on your appearance and what you're wearing. But your ethnicity and your clothing do not define who you are.","As an actress, I value and rely on peaceful self-expression, not only in my daily life, but also in my professional work. This is particularly true, as my commitment to the promotion of human rights is an integral part of my calling as an artist.","Although it is hard to see why any sensible authority would feel threatened by the peaceful expression of one's point of view, there is a long history of trying to repress subversive depictions of political figures - back in the 19th century, for example, France's King Louis Philippe was depicted as a piece of fruit.","History's lesson, of course, is that attempts to suppress free expression have merely confirmed the caricaturists' original critique of heavy-handed and objectionable actions of overreaching governments.","I was shocked when I heard that Farghadani had been sentenced to 12 years and nine months in prison on spurious charges, as Amnesty International notes, of 'spreading propaganda against the system,' 'insulting members of the parliament through paintings' and 'insulting the Supreme Leader' with her cartoon.","Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was not engaged in subversive work; she was an apolitical project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of the Reuters news agency.","Jason Rezaian, held for 544 days in Iran, was not a spy but rather a 'Washington Post' journalist whose work aimed to increase cultural understanding between Iran and the world.","When President Hassan Rouhani was elected in Iran in 2013, he welcomed back the far-flung children of Iran. But one by one, they have been arrested and imprisoned upon their return, a fate that has made me increasingly reluctant to risk going back to a homeland I've not seen since 1992.","The thing that I love about 'Scandal' is every character, it's not clear if they're good or bad. Everyone is both good and bad.","Medicine, anything academic, is a very Persian Iranian route to take in life, in one's career.","Violence against women and girls touches every corner of the globe and is one of the world's most pervasive human rights violations.","My parents realized the dangers of raising a daughter in a social, political, and legal climate that was growing increasingly oppressive toward women and girls. Although they fled to London when I was just three weeks old, the challenges facing women's rights in Iran became ingrained in my social consciousness.","Dance connects us to the musicality of life and to one another. No one should be denied such basic pleasures.","While awareness-building is a crucial first step, cohesive efforts are needed to translate this into real-world change.","As an Iranian woman and activist, Sotoudeh's plight resonated with me on a deeply personal level.","Although each human rights victory energizes us to continue our work, there remains a deep sorrow for those prisoners still wrongfully languishing in jail.","The people of Iran have had to endure repressive laws that have stifled their freedom of speech and religion for too long.","In a lot of ways, I think television is better for women than film.","Clothes are a big part of a free society, I think, and what you wear is so indicative of the political climate you're living in.","It's been an interesting progression, going from soap to a sitcom with 'How I Met Your Mother' and now being a series regular on 'Homeland.'","I entered the acting world at a time when there was a higher demand for Middle Eastern actors in the post-9/11 world, and yeah, the roles weren't great.","When you or your loved ones escape repression, you often find yourself committed to ensuring that freedom prevails.","Generally, I love being part of a project that imparts a positive message, is somehow educational or enlightening, helps to bridge differences, or inspires viewers in some way.","I think a culture can really be elevated through the arts, and it's always a dream come true when I come across roles that enable me to fuse my love of storytelling with my passion for activism and raising social awareness.","'Homeland' is great at challenging our preconceived ideas.","When you're devoted to a greater freedom in the world, you're willing to compromise something you love."],"Nazim Hikmet":["Living is no laughing matter: you must live with great seriousness like a squirrel for example - I mean without looking for something beyond and above living, I mean living must be your whole occupation.","However and wherever we are, we must live as if we will never die.","And don't forget, a prisoner's wife must always think good thoughts."],"Ndamukong Suh":["I think any football is a guy that is able to one, be able to be humble and hungry off the field, but at the same time on the football field understand what they have to get done and be a little bit ferocious.","I guess I'm a fun-loving teddy bear. I've got two sides to me. Obviously, there's the football side that a lot of people see - the mean, ferocious, coming-after-the-quarterback guy. But off the field, I'm a calm, cool, collected guy.","You learn from your mistakes, or you go backward. I'm the kind of person who wants to move forward.","Defensive players kind of have that two-faced kind of way of being able to be very aggressive on the football field and going out there and getting there job done. At the same time, from my own incidents and my own personality, I'm much a person that's very likable and lovable.","Just understanding that if you're not growing up, you're just moving backwards, and I'm a person that I always want to grow and learn and not be the smartest person in the room, because when you're not the smartest person in the room, you're always learning things.","It's not the norm, I guess, to see someone as aggressive as me being more or less very athletic. You see me running, having a big, violent hit, it's going to look bad, but that's the natural ability I've been given. Why would I let it run to the wayside and not use it?","I don't think one moment in somebody's life is going to define them.","My job is to defeat the guy in front of me, do it until he quits, and then wait for them to send in the next guy.","I've always loved fast vehicles and looking at interesting cars.","I've always been in love with Land Rovers and Range Rovers. I own one and was able to make it a little more exclusive.","A couple of my teammates have the rare Ford F650 Super Truck, and they're kitted out with everything - even flat-screen TVs for movies and video-game systems in the back.","I'm attracted to Ferraris and Bentleys, but I don't know if I'll ever have a chance to own one of those.","Growing up, I always thought of Detroit as a basketball town because of the Pistons, but everyone says it's really, at its core, a football town.","I remember watching Barry Sanders highlights as a kid, and the Lions always being a fun team. I, personally, really never had a real negative connotation with the team. And I didn't really listen to those who did after I was drafted.","For whatever reason, Coach Schwartz and I weren't all that close at first. We didn't have that kind of relationship, really. I don't know why, maybe because I was a rookie, but I never felt real comfortable just popping my head in his office and sitting down to talk.","Coach Cunningham's my guy. Without me saying a word, he can read my body language and facial expressions and tell me exactly what I'm thinking and feeling. We're actually very similar people.","I'm a storyline. I'm the chosen one for negative stories and controversial things. If I worried about it all, I would go insane.","Mondays I sleep. I go in at ten, do my lift, watch the game from the day before. Tuesday is off, but I go in, lift, watch film. Then I have French toast with my sister.","Football is a violent sport. Somebody's going to get hurt. It's the game. Just hopefully, you're on the good side of it.","A dirty player is somebody who ultimately is trying to hurt somebody. There's a huge difference. There's no gray in that. Like, you have no conscience, no nothing, no guilt. I don't have that mean streak in me. I don't play angry. It's not anger.","If you find my aggressive and dominating play dirty, then that's your opinion. But I would assume most people want someone who is going to do anything and everything within the lines to win for their team, because I know I would.","I understand there's damage control to do on my image, but people are always gonna have their opinion of me no matter what. I understand 100 people may like me and 1,000 people may hate me. That's fine.","You continue to build and work on new things, and continue to beat offensive linemen, week in and week out.","The game of football, especially in the NFL, is all about situations, and coming out on the big end of that stick.","I think it's very, very tough to compare postseason and in-season, just for the simple fact that there's the heightened levels of energy on both sides of the ball.","I definitely see myself as a leader. One of the ways I've been lucky enough to lead and likely to continue to lead is just my actions and the way that I approach the game and working hard and being a player that steps up in big-time situations when plays need to be made.","I was a defensive lineman coming out of high school who was considered amongst the top... maybe the top six guys, top five guys, and wanted to prove to my team that I was going to be a top guy going into college.","I definitely want to be known as an educated person as well as being a good football player.","The players who said I am the dirtiest player in the league, it's ultimately their opinion, but I would love to hear from many of them on their true opinion on that.","A lot of players have told me they see me as a protector of my teammates, that, side by side, I'm there when something goes down, and I step up beside them and for them when things get nasty. I play the game hard, and I play it physical.","A great guy who is no longer in the league right now who is retired, Kyle Vanden Bosch, I learned a lot from him, and I owe him a lot for my success in the NFL.","Coach Bo Pelini and coach Carl Pelini are two coaches I talk to on a regular basis, especially coach Bo. They are coaches I feel elevated my game.","Outside of my parents, it's my older sister, Ngum. She lives with me in Detroit and helps me with my day-to-day stuff. She's somebody I've always looked up to. When she was leaving high school and going to college, I wanted to follow in her footsteps.","I wish that people had an opportunity to watch me 24/7, like on 'Big Brother.' You'd see a person who is quiet and reserved and very analytical - a huge observer.","Really, you just play football; that's all I can do... I don't change. I'm going to always play tough, hard - that's the way I was brought up at Nebraska, where I really learned football from the Pelinis and that staff and continue to play hard, play blue-collar football."],"Ne-Yo":["Doing as much as you can for as long as you can - that's the motto.","When you're dressing on a budget, simplicity is key.","'Let Me Love You' is about being brave enough to let a person get close enough to you to teach you how to love yourself, to teach you the importance of loving yourself.","I am blessed to be doing what I do. So if I have to be at a photo shoot, do an interview, or make a TV appearance, I am not going to sit around whining and complaining about how I don't want to get up early or I don't feel like talking.","I don't want to call myself a perfectionist, because perfection is imperfection.","I know the music industry is based on a lot of smoke and mirrors in a lot of cases, such as making things look like one thing versus what it actually is. I feel like I've been here long enough that I've surpassed the need for any of that.","I'm the type of guy to put the water on the stove and then walk away and 10 seconds later be like, 'Come on, boil'!","I feel, as an artist, that we don't do enough to appreciate our fans. We are in this position because of the fans, and it's really a blessing.","One of the very few things that I actually read about myself on blogs that got to me was people saying, 'Ne-Yo doesn't do R&B music anymore.' Just because I stepped off the porch to explore doesn't mean I don't live in that house anymore.","Guilty pleasure implies that it's something that I feel guilty for watching... people tell me I should feel guilty for watching because I'm too old to watch it, but I don't give a damn: I love everything on Cartoon Network from 'Adventure Time' to 'The Adventures of Gumball', 'Teen Titans'... all those shows that are for my kids, I like those!","Prince is the ultimate performer. Prince is that dude that's going to get on stage by himself, if he need to, but hold you in the palm of his hand. Like, you can't take your eyes off the man when he's on stage, and he could just be sitting there playing his guitar.","I'm gonna be honest: I was never really a fan of techno music, dance music.","When 'Red Tails' came along, all I knew was that they were the first African-American fighter pilots in the U.S. Air Force. I had no idea how deep the story went or about all their amazing achievements. There were a few Tuskegee Airmen on the set to make sure everything was as authentic as possible.","For my prom, I wore a white suit with a burgundy shirt, tie and cummerbund, along with white shoes, a white trilby and a cane. I was extra fly that day.","A man will talk all day about the woman he wants, but should he come across that woman, he'll do something stupid like cheat on her with the kind of woman he was trying to get away from in the first place. It's not a lot of second chances granted in the realm of that.","I'm trying to bring something new to the Tin Man. He may be the one without the heart, but he's the most heartfelt guy there. It's a more manly heartfelt, a 'don't feel sorry for me' - type of heartfelt. I don't want to say tougher, because that just sounds stupid. But the Tin Man is a man's man.","I like to learn through doing. Let me make a mistake, and then critique me on what I did so that I learn that way.","Honestly, when I first heard that there were rumors out there about me being gay, I thought, 'Wow, someone must really hate me.' There's nothing wrong with being gay, but I just couldn't understand why someone would make up lies like that.","As an artist, you know as a person in the public eye, period, you kind of have a responsibility to the younger kids that are watching and emulating what you do.","We are in a good place. Her name is Crystal Renay. She has much promise. Yes, much promise. Quality.","I'm a fan of FKA Twigs, The Weeknd. I love that kind of ambient R&B. I feel like it's just another soldier in the war to blur the lines and make things to where it's good music and bad music.","That has been everybody's challenge, above the dancing, the singing, the lines: getting into who these characters would be in 2015. Today's Tin Man is heartfelt, but he wouldn't be soft. Today's Dorothy would be sassy.","A Las Vegas show is all-round entertainment. Which means there's some singing, some dancing, some magic, some drama - everything is rolled into that one performance.","My mom was the picture of the blue-collar mom: Two and three and four jobs to make sure that me and my sister never needed, that was her thing.","I sing because I love singing. I perform because I love performing. I write because I actually enjoy writing.","Michael Jackson believed in making music that made people feel good.","I feel like everything is inspired by something else. There is no 100 percent original thought.","Every song I've ever written has been based in reality, based in fact, things that happen to me.","I probably wouldn't be singing if not for Michael Jackson. When I started singing, I didn't like my tone until my mom put me on to Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, so listening to the way they used their instrument helped me get more comfortable with my own.","My style is mainly about comfort. It has to be comfortable, it has to lay right on me, know what I mean?","I pride myself on being the type of artist who can work half in the R&B world and half in the pop world.","I have my diehard R&B fans on one side of the spectrum and my diehard pop and dance fans on the other side of the spectrum.","Hats have been my thing pretty much my whole life but finance has not. I would go to the corner store and buy really cheap baseball style caps and wear those to school.","For the first few years of my life my mom used to cut my hair so there were a lot of bowl-cut hair styles.","Now that I have kids, I want my kids to appreciate my music, but at the same time, I don't want to teach them anything that they shouldn't know just yet.","I never really created a difference between Shaffer Smith, my actual name, and Ne-Yo. They are kind of one in the same. It's been a bit of a gift and a curse. As far as Shaffer Smith is concerned, I've never viewed myself as a celebrity.","I've never viewed myself as above anybody else or anything like that. I'm a regular guy at the end of the day. I like Cinnamon Toast Crunch and The Powerpuff Girls.","Via social media, I reached out, asking about relationships, dreams, hopes, fears, the whole gambit, and the stories that really resonated with me, I wrote songs about.","Me as an artist, I'm more notorious for writing songs that celebrate women, songs that are all about the positive element of the immensely confusing creature that is woman.","I wrote a song that basically turned into a public service announcement for the fellas out there, like, 'Should you run into this type of woman, run for your life!' So the name of the song is 'Run,' featuring the rapper ScHoolboy Q. It's one of the standouts on the album, in my personal opinion.","I always tell the story of 'Irreplaceable.' I initially wrote 'Irreplaceable' with myself in mind, with plans of it being my record. I love that record; however, what I realised about that record was that though given the circumstances of that situation - men and women are not that different - when you sing about it, it changes things, you know?","There are different kinds of R&B happening today. There's the traditional, more soulful R&B that doesn't get the recognition that it deserves. Then there's the more hip-hop oriented stuff. You got your boy Ty Dolla $ign, people like that, who are bringing more hip-hop elements to R&B, which is cool.","The Auto-Tune makes everybody sound the same and takes away all of the emotion because you're singing through this machine, and of course your taking all of this emotion out of your voice for the most part.","Auto-tune is good to keep your notes intact, but it doesn't do much for the feel of your voice.","The name of the album is 'Non-Fiction'. And, I'm calling it that because the name of every song on this album is derived from a true story. Now, some of the stories are mine. Some of the stories belong to some of my fans.","I would love to be able to say that due to my experience in the music industry, when it comes to the songs, I'm killing it over anybody else, but that is not the case. Everybody in this thing is ridiculously talented to where I don't feel special.","My 'Slide Some Oil' ain't gon' be Nipsey Russell's 'Slide Some Oil.' Elijah Kelley's 'You Can't Win' ain't gon' be Michael Jackson's 'You Can't Win.'","Ms. Clinton - Mrs. Clinton, I should say - she's a favorite of mine.","We're falling into a place where melody is somewhat lacking in music. Everybody feels like, okay, too much melody or too much harmony, and it kind of goes over people's heads; they don't understand it.","The story of 'Libra Scale,' the storyline was created first, and then the music was created around the story line.","'Battle: Los Angeles' - I've got to say this was easily one of the most physically trying things that I've ever done in my life because I play a Marine in the film, and they had us training with real live Marines for, like, three weeks. It gave me a whole new respect for just the armed forces, period.","You kinda don't know what's going to make a good song. You've got to shoot around in the dark for a little while.","I've never been the guy to go for the celebrity girl. I've always liked regular girls, regular people, because I've always viewed myself as a regular person who just happens to be gifted in music.","Temptation is just that - she's the girl you claim you don't want, but in the moment, you have more drinks than you should in the club. One thing leads to another, and suddenly you've done something really stupid. You've jeopardized what could've potentially been a really great relationship, all due to temptation.","I'm a rather multifaceted person - or at least I like to fashion myself as such - so my dreams are multifaceted. For example, I had a dream of winning a Grammy, right? I've done that three times over.","I dreamed of one day starring in a film. I've done that twice. Denzel Washington has done it countless times, so I still got some work to do.","I needed to be sexier. I needed to be more hip. I needed to be more edgy and this and that. 'No, don't write that kind of song, write this type of song. No, don't work with that producer, work with this producer. No, don't wear those clothes, wear these clothes.' And I didn't want to be a puppet, you know?","I write because I actually enjoy writing. It's a plus and a fringe benefit that, you know, I can actually provide for my family and, you know, a few people know my name - that's great.","I've never done this from a standpoint of, 'I want to be famous.' I sing because I love singing. I perform because I love performing.","The unfortunate thing about this planet is that we are in no shortage of ignorance.","There's a whole advantage being an executive as an artist.","Back in the day, Motown was on the pulse of young America. It wasn't about just dope contemporary. It was pop, it was R&B, it was all of that.","Movies take a long time because movies take a long damn time to put work into. Whereas music, you don't have as much time. I didn't realize that.","I feel like my music is for everybody. As long as the music is good, I can please everybody.","I'm good but not great at 'Madden'. I have friends that their whole life is based around this video game.","I'm heavy into 'Max Payne 3'. That's a good one. I like any of the fighting games and all of the 'Tekken' and 'Street Fighter' series.","'Madden' is the closest thing to actually being on the field yourself. It's so ridiculously realistic. Before I play it, I honestly didn't understand. 'What's all the hype? It's a video game'. Then I sat down and played it, and you feel like you're on the field.","All my musical influences came from my mom, who did everything to music. She played it 24 hours a day, seven days a week in our house. So that's where my love for music came from.","Early inspirations included Michael Jackson, Prince, Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway, Marvin Gaye, Lionel Richie... Those were the people I actually wound up studying just to hone my craft.","Growing up in Vegas, over time you get to see shows like Tom Jones, Wayne Newton, I mean, The Rat Pack ran Vegas way, way back, and I'm a huge fan of that whole era and vibe.","For starters, I wanted to do an acting role in a movie that had nothing to do with the music business or in which I would play a singer or a songwriter. When I act, I don't even want to be thought of as Ne-Yo.","My initial attraction to 'Red Tails' was the opportunity to play a character that was not me. 'Stomp the Yard' was a great film, but I played myself there.","Who directed the video 'No More Drama' for Mary J. Blige. I was actually kickin' with J. Lo talking about some music that we're gonna put together, and we were talking about great directors. She said she really, really liked that video and was wondering who directed it, so yeah, I looked it up!","Huge 'Scandal' fan, and I have been since the beginning.","People are bringing a lot more of that funk element into their music, you know, with Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson - that's one that you never thought you would hear something like that on the radio again 'cause it just sounds so much like the Back Bay and what they were doing with music back then.","Chimere's not mine. That hurt 'cause I had attached myself to this guy, you know. This is my son. I'm looking at him, and I'm picturing I'm gonna be old, and he's gonna be - this is my son! It's not my son.","In my mind, I was still Chimere's father. I was there when he was born. I saw him when he first came out. I held him. He was my kid.","R&B is my home. It's who I am. It's who I've been. It's the first genre I fell in love with. It's the reason why I've been able to do other genres of music.","For me to be here at album number six, it's kind of a way to say, 'Thank you for allowing me to be here... to still be around.'","I've always been the person to look at any turmoil as temporary. I recall times where my mom was working five and six jobs, and there's still no food in the house.","Beyonce's the kind of artist where you're not gonna see it till it's right.","With Jay-Z, it's hard not to be amazing.","I'm trying to escape the shackles of a pen and a pad. I've sat in sessions with Jay-Z where he doesn't write anything down. He'll come up with the most incredible triple entendre, all in his head - it's amazing.","It's really rare that an entire genre of music allows an artist from a different genre to come and live there.","'Stomp the Yard' was a great film. It was a great film, great opportunity. It's the reason I live in Atlanta to this day, that film. But as far as acting goes, it wasn't very challenging. I played me.","I would've given my right arm to do something on the 'Ray' film, the movie about Ray Charles.","I grew up in Las Vegas. My mom worked in pretty much every casino on the Strip.","I'm not a natural. I had to teach myself - or be taught - everything I do. I just spent hours and hours in the mirror mimicking Michael Jackson.","My first song was 'So Sick,' which was my first number one as an artist, and I turned the mic around to the crowd, and they sang the whole song. Every lyric. That was my first experience with the power of music.","Sammy was the only one that looked like me, so I naturally gravitated to him. Sammy made it cool to be black at a time when, let's just say it, it wasn't very cool to be black. His name was on the front of the building in lights, and he had to go in the back. But you never saw him sweat.","I think people are getting into these 'Empire' songs because of the emotional investment they have in the characters. You kind of feel like you know the songs already because you just watched them play out in front of you with these characters.","I've spoken before on how the art of storytelling has been lost a bit. I definitely feel 'Empire' is helping to reprogram us back to that place where we pay attention and invest emotionally in the records and the artists.","Me and Drake gonna be neighbors if Donald Trump becomes president.","Me being an artist working with dancers and seeing how hard they work, they are the first to show up and the last to leave. They work just as hard, if not harder, than me - and they never get credit for it.","You know what? At this point in my career, at this point in my life... I'm 34 years old; I don't have time to be hiding.","Of course, there are some things you keep personal and private because you're a human being. But on the other side of it, I ain't got time to be hiding nothing and all that. It is what it is.","I'm never going to complain about doing my job. I love what I do!","A lot of times, when artists are rushing to put out projects, it's on some financial tip because they want to make money. But for me, I'm not in any rush.","I want to connect with my fans the way Mary J. Blige's fans connect with her.","There's no recreating what Michael Jackson and Diana Ross did in 'The Wiz'. We're trying to figure out who these characters are in 2015. How would these times change their motives, change the things they would say and do?","I recall my mum tried to teach me how to fry chicken once, and I almost burned down half the kitchen... I don't think I have the patience for cooking.","I've been a huge Adele fan since I heard her album '19.'","All genres of music have to evolve, grow, and expand in order to maintain. I don't think there's anything wrong with the growth of R&B. I welcome it.","I know everyone says attention spans are shorter now, and if you can't get them in the first 20 seconds, you lost them. But I honestly believe if you give someone something worth slowing down to really pay attention to, they will.","Getting involved with the Boys and Girls Club helped keep me and my sister from getting in trouble.","My mom has always been a caregiver, and she's perfect in this role leading my foundation.","Let's make Holberton one of the biggest schools on the face of the planet."],"NeNe Leakes":["I'm just not into trying to convince people like me. I always say to myself, 'It is what it is.' I walk into a situation knowing that people are either going to love me or they're not, and that's OK. I'm just going to be me. You can't be everything to everyone.","Let me get you to understand I don't bully anybody. I stand up for what I believe in and I'm very honest and I always tell the truth. I'm not a liar, I'm not manipulative and I don't stab you in your back because I will stab you in your chest.","Most of the time my own family feels like I don't need anything, I'm tough as nails and I don't have any feelings about anything. They really think that I'm this super tough person. I have a tough exterior, but I get upset. I have feelings and all those things. I wear my heart on my sleeve.","I'm coming out with a wine... I'm actually a restaurateur. I have Famous Famiglia Pizzeria that has opened up in the Sacramento airport. I'm also working with my business partner on opening up the Linnethia Lounge.","I'm just a real person and I tell it like it is. I don't have a lot of secrets, which has been a fault of mine.","When you watch these reality shows, the person that is hated on the most is usually the one that gets the most shine.","I am obsessed with trash TV. I watch all reality shows. I watch all the 'Housewives.' I am a huge fan of 'New Jersey.'","One thing to avoid is trendy stuff, though - you gotta go timeless. Even if you want a little luxury in your life and you want to splurge on a Gucci bag, pick a great black one you can wear all the time.","My first marriage was very traditional, in the church, and then we left the church and went to the reception hall. So this time, I'd like to go fairy tale all the way.","I'm for all kinds of gay rights. I'm almost like a gay man myself.","I don't get star-stuck. I love Angelina Jolie, though.","Being on 'Glee' was amazing. I remember my first day on set, my first day I arrived to the set I was in my trailer and all of the actors came and banged on my door - Lea Michele, Chris Colfer, Amber Riley, Naya Rivera. They all welcomed me with open arms, so it was a great experience. It felt like family, and I miss them a lot over there.","My first film was with Cuba Gooding Jr, 'The Fighting Temptations,' and I had a little part here and there on little shows as guest stars. And I've taken acting classes.","I love becoming a character outside of who I am. Even when I was a little girl, I loved make believe, so I like it.","Well, you know, I love being an entrepreneur and when I did 'Celebrity Apprentice' with Mr. Trump, he taught us a lot about starting businesses.","I love talk shows and hosting. I would want to do something like that. I'm not sure I would want to be a reality star continuously.","I feel like I've come off as an outspoken woman. Sometimes I think I've come off as confrontational. But I feel like it's been pretty fair. Those are parts of me.","I was very popular in high school.","I don't have anything to hide. And for the record, I am not against plastic surgery. I believe that any woman that wants to do anything or fix anything that bothers her - if she's doing it for herself - I'm all for it.","I've heard that I've gotten a lighter complexion, as if I've bleached my skin. I think that is so stupid and ludicrous. For those who want to bleach their skin, that's fine. I just didn't bleach mine. I'm a black woman. I don't want to be anything but a black woman.","Not only did I come out as a reality star that was very boisterous and vivacious and outspoken and all those things. I flipped that into money and respect. And a lot of people can't do that.","In my real life, both my bosses are gay. On the 'Real Housewives of Atlanta,' Andy Cohen is gay, everybody at Bravo is gay - we call them the gay mafia. Over at 'Glee' and 'The New Normal,' my boss Ryan Murphy is gay. On the show, my boss, played by Andrew Reynolds, is gay in real life. I'm surrounded by all my gay bosses.","I'm coming out with my line of shoes and my very first shoe is called 'The Nethia.' How we came up with the name is that my legal name is Linnethia and we shortened it.","I have a glam-baby. Let's be correct, now. I'm way too young and too fabulous to be a grandma. I'm a glam-mom.","TV is tricky. You can do some stuff and people will tune out and never tune back in. It's sort of like putting a bad taste in somebody's mouth. Some people may not ever tune in again. And then there's some people that will tune in just to tune in and see what's gon' happen.","I don't know what reality television does, but it breaks up relationships.","I think that everyone is saying all kinds of things about 'rich.' Not only am I rich from doing some of things I've been able to do, but I'm rich in spirit. I'm rich in health. I'm rich in every way possible.","I wouldn't want to do a 'Maury Povich' show. Baby daddy! Who's your daddy? Who's your mama? I wouldn't want to do that kind of show.","I am here now, because I am supposed to be here. And I guess when it is my time to cross over there, I will be over there. I am not religious, but I am spiritual, honey. My day is coming!","'Teen Moms!' I started watching them like the first two seasons, and I stopped. I stopped because they are too young. I feel sorry for them. And I didn't watch that show 'Hoarders.' That thing would made my skin crawl.","I know I'm not a bully and everybody has their opinions and that's fine with me.","I still sing. I don't know if I'm going to sing on 'Glee' or 'New Normal.'","I was kind of reluctant to sing on the 'Housewives' because there are so many 'Housewives' that are singing that can't really sing. I didn't want to get out there and sing and not be taken seriously.","I hope to stay on 'Glee,' I hope to still be a 'Housewife' and I hope to do 'The New Normal.' I just want to do it all! Why not? I'm only going to be young for a little while longer.","I like the Kardashians. I'm a fan. I watch their show.","Every year for New Years I write down all of my goals and dreams and put them in my Bible. At the end of the year I go and pull the paper out and check this off and check that off.","There are so many reality shows on now where they want you to be crazy, the girls are just going bananas; you know how they portray brown girls. They portray us in a different type of light.","I would love to be a guest on a talk show or a panel that shows women who have been on reality shows who've had success, to prove to audiences that you don't have to be a fool to become successful.","I'm not a real makeup girl - you see me in lots of makeup on 'Housewives,' but I'm really all about skin. Take it from me: Wash, moisturize, and never neglect the neck.","I'm a big potato chip girl. I don't like chocolate and cakes and all that, but I have to have my potato chips. I've got bags in the back of my car right now! But I never beat myself up about it, because, look: You can't give up every damn thing. You need something in your life that you like just because you like it!","Because I'm shooting 'The New Normal' and 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' at the same time, so my schedule is double. I leave one show and go and shoot the other. The cameras are with me for, like, every day of my life. So I'm extremely tired."],"Neal A. Maxwell":["God does not begin by asking our ability, only our availability, and if we prove our dependability, He will increase our capability.","Discouragement is not the absence of adequacy but the absence of courage."],"Neal Asher":["If I could time travel into the future, my first port of call would be the point where medical technology is at its best because, like most people on this planet, I have this aversion to dying.","The end of the mid finger on my left hand is wider than normal, the nail distorted and a scar in the end. This was from when I managed to shove it in the path of a mower blade.","My favourite place to write is at my desk in my house in the mountains of Crete. I produce more there because one big distraction is missing: the Internet.","I have had periods when I've overused a word, 'candent' being one example, but I'm trying not to do that any more.","I've been an engineer, barman, skip lorry driver, coalman, boat window manufacturer, contract grass cutter and builder.","For me, the writing process is the same as the reading process. I want to know what happens next.","With fantasy, one often has to think of a well-loved series before narrowing the selection to a favourite book. So it is with Zelazny. I've read his 'Princes in Amber' books so often, I know them almost verbatim, so much so that I am now trying to forget them so I can return to them with renewed pleasure.","Gemmell's name guarantees a satisfying story and a thumping good read. I recommend all his heroic creations - 'Druss the axeman,' 'the Jerusalem man,' among others - but my favourite has to be 'Waylander': Clint Eastwood with a crossbow and the same 'Make my day, punk' attitude.","I've been reading Tanith Lee since I was a teenager, beginning with 'The Birthgrave' and 'The Storm Lord.' Only recently did I discover, to my delight, how many more of her books I've yet to read.","Moorcock's interlinked 'Eternal Champion' series is a constant source of enjoyment. Of its tragic hero incarnations, my favourite is 'Elric of Melnibone,' and the best book has to be 'Stormbringer.' And as for that other sword, Excalibur? Pah! Use it to spread your butter.","It wasn't until I had been writing on and off for maybe ten years that I started to establish any kind of routine, thought I couldn't put a finger on an exact date, and this routine relates simply to the aphorism 'How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.'","When I get started each day, I read through and correct the previous day's 2,000 words, then start on the next. As I reach that figure, I try to simply stop and not go on until reaching a natural break. If you just stop while you know what you're going to write next, it's easier to get going again the next day.","When you reach the editing stage, it is often the case that you can get too involved with the story to detect errors. You can see words in your head that aren't actually there on the page, sentences blur together and errors escape you, and you follow plot threads and see only the images in your skull."],"Neal Barnard":["The beef industry has contributed to more American deaths than all the wars of this century, all natural disasters, and all automobile accidents combined.","To give a child animal products is a form of child abuse.","If beef is your idea of 'real food for real people', you'd better live real close to a real good hospital.","Meat consumption is just as dangerous to public health as tobacco use... It's time we looked into holding the meat producers and fast-food outlets legally accountable.","In my own life, I decided to leave meat off my plate in medical school, but was a bit slow to realise that dairy products and eggs are not health foods either.","I have been following a vegan diet now since the 1980s, and find it not only healthier, but also much more attractive than the chunks of meat that were on my plate as a child.","A vegan diet takes care of most of what we need to do. But you'll also want to minimize the use of oils generally, because while olive oil and other vegetable oils are better for your heart than chicken fat, they are as fattening as animal fats.","We help people to begin truly healthful diets, and it is absolutely wonderful to see, not only their success, but also their delight at their ability to break old habits and feel really healthy for a change.","Chicken fat, beef fat, fish fat, fried foods - these are the foods that fuel our fat genes by giving them raw materials for building body fat."],"Neal Boortz":["Free speech is meant to protect unpopular speech. Popular speech, by definition, needs no protection.","Wallow too much in sensitivity and you can't deal with life, or the truth.","If you walk through life in a fighting pose with your fists balled up and ready to strike, someone, someday, somewhere, is going to want to test your mettle.","If you support the war on drugs in its present form, then you're only paying lip-service to the defense of freedom, and you don't really grasp the concept of the sovereign individual human being.","The main purpose of Social Security is to redistribute wealth, to make an increasingly large number of Americans dependent on government for their basic needs in their retirement years.","There is nothing quite so depressing as waking up to face a day when you know that you are going to have to deal with a government office or bureaucrat.","I don't believe in atheists.","I'm an entertainer. Not a journalist or spokesman for anybody. Truth is, a lot of my listeners absolutely hate what I have to say.","If I'm tapping anything, it's the frustration of people who have something to say at work or home or in some social setting and just can't do it. I do it for them. I don't take prisoners.","The key to accepting responsibility for your life is to accept the fact that your choices, every one of them, are leading you inexorably to either success or failure, however you define those terms.","How many Catholic schools do you think teach the students to question the authority of the Pope? Do you believe Christian schools teach students to question or challenge the authority of Jesus Christ? Do military schools teach the cadets to challenge the authority.","The principal purpose of the Democratic Party is to use the force of government to take property away from the people who earn it and give it to people who do not.","Freedom isn't for wimps.","Religion is all-too-often a refuge for scoundrels.","A lot of people out there pay good lip service to the idea of personal freedom... right up to the point that someone tries to do something that they don't personally approve of.","If it is wrong for you to take money from someone else who earned it, to take their money by force for your own needs, then it is certainly just as wrong for you to demand that the government step forward and do this dirty work for you.","The Tea Partiers don't want all regulations eliminated. They just want laws that can be understood and regulations that aren't going to destroy businesses, or leave deserving veterans without a source for a mortgage loan.","The House of Representatives was not designed to sit idly by and rubberstamp every piece of legislation sent their way by the Senate, especially legislation passed on a straight party line vote under the spurious policy of reconciliation.","Usually, I take a hike for a while after submitting a column to Townhall. Too much of my insensitivity can cause emotional problems among proggies, and I am, after all, a compassionate man.","Many unions have contracts with employers that are based on a multiple of the prevailing minimum wage. If the minimum wage goes up, union salaries go up by a similar percentage.","I was your quintessential nerd in high school."],"Neal Cassady":["I alone, as the sharer of their way of life, presented a replica of childhood.","I became the unnatural son of a few score of beaten men."],"Neal McDonough":["Graham Yost is a genius, and I know that very well because we worked together on 'Band of Brothers' and 'Boomtown.'","With four kids, it's hard to watch anything other than 'Sesame Street.'","Acting is probably the number one team sport in America as far as I'm concerned.","The great thing about 'Justified' is that the writers will craft a scene, but if the actors come up with a great idea, they're 100% for it.","If you don't care for the villain, if you don't love him and hate him at the same time, then he's just boring.","'Justified' is one of the greatest teams I've ever played for. It's just awesome.","Ted Griffin, who created 'Terriers,' is one of my dearest friends.","For Michael Wright and Frank Darabont to cast me as the ultimate good guy and Eddie Burns as the ultimate bad guy, and really switching roles from what we usually play, is pretty awesome. That generally doesn't happen, but TNT is a horse of a different color.","Mini-series are my favorite medium to act in because it's the right amount of pages you shoot a day, it's the right amount of time that you're with a character, and they really advertise it a lot so that people get excited for this epic event."],"Neal Patterson":["Cerner's focus over the last 20 years has been to provide healthcare, predominately healthcare providers, with advanced clinical and management information systems. Our mission is to connect the appropriate persons, knowledge, and resources at the appropriate time and location to achieve the optimal health outcome.","Cerner is a company that just celebrated its 20th anniversary in 1999.","Cerner has significant growth opportunities. We believe there is leverage with HNA Millennium and in our business model that can grow both our top-line and earnings during 2000 and through the foreseeable part of this decade.","We don't have a business model for health care in this country, We just have a business model for care. The way doctors and hospitals get paid is something bad has got to happen. It's a pure reactive model.","Siemens' health care IT assets provide additional scale, R&D, an impressive client base, and knowledgeable and experienced associates who will help Cerner achieve our plans for the next decade.","We're the only western country that doesn't have a national health care ID.","Without a national ID and the ability to create true data that can be be safely and securely sent between individuals, we are going to introduce new systemic risk back into the system.","I designed and developed an unbelievable number of applications early in my life.","Hell will freeze over before this CEO implements another employee benefit in this culture.","Insurance companies as they exist today are going to be eliminated."],"Neal Schon":["Beyond the Thunder is the closest I've recorded to an acoustic thing.","I'm just getting older and better.","Nobody's perfect. Everyone slides here and there, and they have their ups and downs. When they are down, that is not the time to step all over them.","The best part was watching Journey grow into this monster. The band was huge, playing these enormous gigs.","You learn at a certain point that you have to focus on the business side of music. After getting ripped off a couple of times, you figure out that you need to get a grip on it.","World Play is very '70s arena rock, very raw and in your face, and that's what we wanted. We recorded it in a very off-the-cuff manner and didn't really plan out how we were going to play. My solos are first takes.","When I go out with Journey, it is a complete cakewalk. I can afford my own bus.","What I have is a bunch of really hungry, amazingly talented guys that can kick anybody's rear end.","We are taking close to $10 a CD the way we are doing it, and I think that is a fair amount to split up between five guys. Each of us makes like two bucks a record.","We are doing what Prince did. Everyone that comes to a show billed as An Evening with Journey will get our new CD. We figured that is our best store because they are our biggest fans.","There has been the biggest black cloud following me around. People believe it's all my fault that Steve is not here. He has always had an open door, and he doesn't choose to do this any more.","The world now knows that Steve Perry is welcome to come and sing with us anytime he wants.","In a lot of aspects it's cooler that we don't have a lot of really overly famous people in the band.","I've never done a solo tour. I feel like getting out there and doing that.","The heavy guitars are the ones that sound good. They are not that comfortable, but they do sound great.","I never got into sports at all until I was in my early 20s, after my music career got going.","I met the Santana band when I was 14. By the time I was 15, I was a member of the band.","I keep on calling them records because they will always be records to me.","I haven't stopped playing. If you play all the time, then your chops are up and you tend to grow.","I am not a pop musician; I don't want to play bubble-gummy pop stuff.","I've got the recording process down, and I can knock it out very quickly.","I'm not a guy to go in the studio and spend months, let alone years, like some people do. I cannot even be in the studio for a month, it will drive me nuts.","During the 1970s and 1980s Gibson did use my likeness, but we never signed anything. This new Signature model is the first time we struck a formal written deal for a guitar with my name on it."],"Neal Shusterman":["Try to see things differently - It's the only way to get a clearer perspective on the world and on your life.","I have a color-coded computer spreadsheet that divides things down to chapter fragments. Each character's point-of-view is a different color. The text of the manuscript is color-coded the same way. The last thing I do before submitting the manuscript is turn all those colors back to black.","Before I start, I trick myself into thinking I know what's going to happen in the story, but the characters have ideas of their own, and I always go with the character's choices. Most of the time I discover plot twists and directions that are better than what I originally had planned.","I love writing music, but it seems I'm always writing words, so I don't get much time to do it.","I post on Twitter regularly, and when I checked my followers, I saw that my own characters were following me. They sounded eerily like my characters would actually sound. It was a very surreal thing to see come to life digitally!","I thought 'UnSouled' would come in at around 400 pages, but it took 650 pages, and even then I felt like I was rushing the conclusion, so I asked my editor and publisher if I could divide it again. So a sequel became a trilogy, and the trilogy became a tetralogy - although we're not calling it that.","My fans have always been so supportive, and several years ago, I realized that I could thank them by naming all my characters after my Twitter and Facebook fans."],"Neal Stephenson":["The difference between stupid and intelligent people - and this is true whether or not they are well-educated - is that intelligent people can handle subtlety.","The difference between ignorant and educated people is that the latter know more facts. But that has nothing to do with whether they are stupid or intelligent.","It is the fate of operating systems to become free.","Talent was not rare; the ability to survive having it was.","Once a person has all the things they need to live, everything else is entertainment.","Most countries are static, and they need to do is keep having babies. But America's like this big old clanking smoking machine that just lumbers across the landscape scooping up and eating everything in sight.","One of the most frightening things about your true nerd, for may people, is not that he's socially inept - because everybody's been there - but rather his complete lack of embarrassment about it."],"Neale Donald Walsch":["Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.","A life lived of choice is a life of conscious action. A life lived of chance is a life of unconscious creation.","Glorify who you are today, do not condemn who you were yesterday, and dream of who you can be tomorrow.","I think that's a result of just a general increase in speed of the vibration of life itself.","The Roman Catholics teach that unless you're a Roman Catholic you do not go to heaven.","God is in the sadness and the laughter, in the bitter and the sweet.","There is a divine purpose behind everything - and therefore a divine presence in everything.","As told in Friendship with God, if we simply decided to believe and act as if first, we're all one, and second, life is eternal, it would render virtually everything we've done all our lives pointless.","I think in metaphysical terms, I would call that increasing the speed of the vibration of life.","It is the great sadness of our species that we have not found a way to eliminate the conflict and to eliminate violence as a device to resolve our conflicts throughout the entire history of the human race.","The new spirituality will step away from dogma, will step away from 'We're right and you're wrong.'","It's a very small and select slice of all the people who have ever been born. I believe we've come back during this time, those of us who are here now, specifically to experience it. And to cause a 'quickening of the spirit.'","A great many people experience the movement from one century to the next, but a minuscule number of people experience the movement from one millennium to the next.","I was told to challenge every spiritual teacher, every world leader to utter the one sentence that no religion, no political party, and no nation on the face of the earth will dare utter: 'Ours is not a better way, ours is merely another way.","If we win, someone else loses. But if someone else loses, we lose. Which is a point we're not getting. The new spirituality will make this just painfully obvious.","There's no way you can misunderstand the teachings of the Qur'an, there's no way you can misunderstand the teachings of the Bible, there's no way you can misunderstand the teachings of the Bhaghavad Gita, or of the Book of Mormon, or of the other sacred texts of many of those religions.","Nothing has done more to separate and divide human beings one from another than exclusivist organized religion.","The sad part about our past is that religions, ironically enough, are responsible for creating the most destructive idea that has ever been visited upon the human race: the idea that there is such a thing as 'better.'","I think the new spirituality will be a spirituality that's not based on a particular dogma. And that steps away from the old spiritual paradigm that we have created on this planet, which comes from a thought that there is such a thing as being better.","Beyond the Catholic exclusionary paradigm is a larger one which is the Christian one. Christians claim that if you don't believe in Christ, you can't get to heaven. Well that eliminates two thirds of the world's population!","One either has to believe in a God who's terribly prejudiced, or disbelieve the teachings of such exclusionary theologies. Religions have taught us that 'we are better than they.'","And because we are, somehow, better than they, we get to go to heaven and they don't. Christians will tell you outright that they believe that.","They may not use the word better. But they certainly believe that they'll go to heaven and Jews will not.","It graduates to 'our state is better than your state', and 'our nation is better than your nation.' And it circles all the way around to where it started: 'Our God is better than your God.'","Because we believe that our ethnic group, our society, our political party, our God, is better than your God, we kill each other.","The new spirituality will bring about what I'm calling the 'end of better.' And that is in fact what is called for in the next of the series of books that I've been writing.","I'm calling my book series the 'with God series.' And this next 'with God' book is Friendship with God, which comes out in November. This books challenges us to bring about the end of 'better' on this planet.","The new spirituality is that it will produce an experience in human encounters in which we become a living demonstration of the basic spiritual teaching 'We are all one.'","The new spirituality will also base itself on a third very large spiritual understanding, which is that life is eternal. Most religious people claim to believe that, but very few people actually live as if that were true.","Because our choices are largely based on survival. But if life is eternal, life is not a question.","It'll become obvious that we've really been working against ourselves.","As the new spirituality begins to become the pervasive spirituality of the planet, we'll find that we have abandoned our philosophy of contradictions in which we say we're all one but continue to try to win.","And in which we say that life is eternal but continue to struggle to survive.","I think that things happen individually first, and then collectively. It's not the other way around.","You'll find individuals agreeing on this, but when they get into collective societies and larger groups they find it difficult to achieve group agreement.","As we move into the 21st century, there's what the Bible calls a 'quickening of the spirit.'","And we're seeing a higher level of consciousness and many more opportunities for people to challenge their present ways of thinking and move into a grander and larger experience of who they really are.","We've seen in the last half century an incredible shift. This is just an extraordinary time to be alive.","The world is starving for a new spiritual truth - a truth that works in sustaining life, not a truth that brings an end to life."],"Ned Beatty":["I've had this problem since I was in my 20s. They don't call it manic depression anymore. They call it a bipolar disorder, and I'm a Type 2.","I only really work when I want to.","I'm getting grumpier all the time.","I was born just barely south of the Mason Dixon line.","I'm a perfect example of the grumpy, old man. I'm really good at it.","I'll tell you what I would do in a shot if I could. I would sing in the barbershop quartet in The Music Man.","I'm blessed with eight children - though I'm talking about eight adults now.","I want to see the writers strike because the writers, god bless them, are the only true commies we have in Hollywood.","It always impresses me when a person of small stature has command."],"Ned Beauman":["I always save a huge book for a flight, because then you read it at both airports and on the plane and by the time you get home you're a quarter of the way through and it doesn't feel so unmanageable any more.","Until I was 16, I read nothing but science fiction. I loved William Gibson and I still do. But my favourite book when I was growing up, for a long time, was 'Snow Crash' by Neal Stephenson, which I must have read about a dozen times when I was a teenager.","I read 'The Good Soldier' by Ford Madox Ford again every so often.","I don't have a day job, so I read any time of day.","The simile has to match the tone of its surroundings and has to be like a little joke. Writing a simile that isn't funny on some level is quite hard.","There's never a bad time to put earplugs in. They're the kind of thing you can reject as a bit lame, but somebody told me to do start wearing earplugs and it turned out to be great advice.","I'm reasonably good at talking onstage, but actually holding court in a pub is all to do with power dynamics which I don't think has anything to do with fiction.","I'm very finicky about when I'm in the right mood to write. So most days, I find some excuse not to do anything.","I would love to learn how to air kiss non-awkwardly.","I started my first novel when I was 10, and have produced thousands of pages of juvenilia since.","Plot is tremendously important to me: I can't stand books where nothing happens, and I can't imagine ever writing a novel without at least one murder.","I was always determined that one way or another I would force a book on the world, even if I had to resort to writing one about a tabby cat who solves mysteries.","Just as the best way to judge an adult is by his or her record collection, the best way to judge a pub is by the albums on its jukebox."],"Ned Rorem":["Arguably, no artist grows up: If he sheds the perceptions of childhood, he ceases being an artist.","Humor is the ability to see three sides to one coin.","Art means to dare - and to have been right.","The hardest of all the arts to speak of is music, because music has no meaning to speak of.","Inspiration could be called inhaling the memory of an act never experienced.","Divine fires do not blaze each day, but an artist functions in their afterglow hoping for their recurrence."],"Ned Tanen":["There's nothing like a hit movie to make you think you're one of the chosen people. It's amazing how smart we are the morning after a hit opens.","Every woman has had the guy she's broken up with park across the street and stare at her door. Every guy has had someone call at two in the morning and hang up. Or you've been the person who has done those things.","If you really don't care what an audience thinks, make a home movie and show it on your wall."],"Ned Vizzini":["Adolescence is the most Technicolor time in our lives. It's the time when adulthood is new and we care most about it. It contains the highs and lows that excite me as a writer.","People have always asked me why I'm drawn to material about kids, and for me, it's - I remember being at that age and feeling completely and utterly powerless. You know, there's so many things you wanna do and so many things you're told you can't do.","A lot of the books that I grew up reading were pretty brutal, like the 'Redwall' books.","A novel wouldn't be a book if there weren't some flights of fancy on the part of the author, stopping time to examine things, or to tell a joke.","Putting lessons in young adult books is very dangerous.","You have tremendous freedom in the young adult book world to write what you want. You can put R-rated content in a book that you can't in a similarly targeted movie.","I always start a book thinking that it can be something other than first-person present, and I always come back to first-person present. It's just the easiest way.","'Game of Thrones' cares about children. Children are heirs. There's no hemming and hawing about how they're desensitized to violence or they cost too much to send to college. They're a blessing - in many ways the only blessing - and even the evil ones have parents who love them.","Once you have a kid, it's amazing how quickly people ask, 'So are you going to stop at just one?'","I have an issue with dogs - I can't pick up after them. It's nothing personal; it just makes me feel like a servant."],"Neel Mukherjee":["Meat-fetishiser that I was, I used to find willed vegetarianism inexplicable. It was one thing to be a vegetarian because of religious and caste reasons - something I was familiar with because of my Indian upbringing - but to choose to be a vegetarian when you could eat meat for every meal every day? That seemed madness to me.","Nostalgia is a particular affliction of immigrant fiction, and it's led to a kind of sclerosis of the form. I hate nostalgia, and I feel it's good to be aware of the politics of these genres.","In any restaurant, my eyes alight first, as if by an atavistic pull, on the meat dishes on the menu. In any dinner party I throw, I think of the non-vegetarian dish as central. I view this as a combination of weakness, greed and moral failure. Someone please help.","The Naxalite revolution - an ultra-left Maoist movement - in Bengal, and elsewhere in India, in the late 1960s provides one strand of 'The Lives of Others.'","The freedom fighters in India's long struggle for independence from British rule, or members of the African National Congress, were once classed as terrorists. History, as they say, is written by victors, but history also has many cunning corridors - how much time must elapse before all those tricky side-passages are revealed?","To be an Indian writer is to write, necessarily and inevitably, about politics, so it was a given that the story of the Ghoshes, the family at the centre of 'The Lives of Others,' should have a political soul.","Work defines our lives and our place in the world.","I don't read my books, so I don't allow myself the dangerous luxury of toying with the idea of doing things differently.","I wouldn't call myself a 'literary critic,' just a book reviewer.","One writes what one can, or has to, write.","Remember that what seems zeitgeisty today is the cause of tomorrow's bafflement or, worse, ridicule.","I grew up in financially straitened circumstances and meat, which was expensive, was a rare thing at mealtimes. We ate meat about once a month, if that.","India introduced Britain to vegetarianism - see Tristram Stuart's excellent first book on this - and it is possible, indeed all too easy, to be a vegetarian in India and eat extraordinarily good, varied food every day, with very few 'repeats.'","The bestseller charts, a sure indicator of public taste, tell us with relentless frequency that Marian Keyes or Jeffrey Archer is a better author, by some dizzying six-figure sum, both in numbers of copies and money, than, say, J. M. Coetzee or Patrick White. Are they right?","Given that all our lives rest on work that defines us, the business of labor, the wealth that work manifests itself to, I find it odd that not much is written about it. We talk about relationships, damage, adultery, revolution, but we don't talk about work.","When a book is going well, it tells you where to go.","I had just begun an M.A. in Creative Writing, and I had to write a novel, so I began writing a novel that later became 'A Life Apart.'","Innocence is a pretty dangerous thing, you know. Revisit Dostoevsky's 'The Idiot' or, for that matter, Greene's 'The Quiet American' to find out how destructive it can be.","Nostalgia can be extremely powerful in the right hands: think of the intense longing in the films Andrei Tarkovsky made after he left the U.S.S.R. They wring your soul.","I'm much more attracted to the miscegenation of cultures than to harmony.","I have one very bad experience with a U.K. publisher, who gave it out to be understood that she wanted to publish my book and made me do a lot of changes, all outside a contract, only to reject it in the end.","I start with theory rather than people. I don't like novels which have no theoretical or philosophical underpinning. I hate the contemporary novel where people just sit and talk to each other about their relationships.","I think there's a joy to be had in taking readers where they just don't want to go. If you are writing a properly realist novel, then don't blink. Why not see something for what it is and render it truthfully? I find it a good way of going about writing - not to blink.","Fiction can either be a mirror reflecting you back to yourself or it can be a clean pane of glass looking on the outside.","Writing a book is as difficult or as easy as any other job. Everyone's job is difficult. So to fetishize difficulties in writing as something extra-difficult or something very privileged - I don't buy that at all.","It's always good to get good reviews. I read my reviews. There are a lot of writers who don't read their reviews at all. I read them; then I put them away because it's not good to engage with them too much.","To write, I think one must sit in one place and be bored. Boredom is a very good state for writers to be. Things cook away in your head when you're bored, and suddenly one day, you have a book or a germ of a book."],"Neil Abercrombie":["So as soon as the land was worth something and there was money in the bank, all of a sudden everybody got interested in non-discrimination, in who's really going to administer this stuff.","There was a queen that was overthrown here. So I was affected by all of that and felt profoundly grateful for the opportunity to live in Hawaii, and I set out at once to try to fit in.","When there wasn't any money involved, for all intents and purposes, nobody gave a damn. But now the land, supposedly worthless, is seen for what it really is: an incredibly valuable asset.","Land in Hawaii is money. What I'm talking about here is ceded land - land that belonged to the kingdom and was ceded to the republic and then to the state when we achieved statehood.","Western concepts of ownership and privatization came in and clashed with that. So land began to be exchanged.","Land began to be seen as something to be owned privately and exploited for private interests, and never was entirely reconciled with the old ideas that land should be utilized in common for the good of all.","So there's always been this clash between what is the public good - that which belongs to all of us in common - and what can be exploited for a private interest.","A good portion of the airport is on ceded lands, and lease money was paid for that. So the state's collecting lease money because all of a sudden 'worthless' land now has an airport on it.","I remember saying to the chairman after serving the first year, 'Why are we doing this? Why don't the Hawaiians have control?' 'Well, we have no mechanism to do it,' I was told.","You're talking serious money already in the bank, and millions of dollars coming in every year."],"Neil Armstrong":["That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.","Mystery creates wonder and wonder is the basis of man's desire to understand.","Research is creating new knowledge.","The important achievement of Apollo was demonstrating that humanity is not forever chained to this planet and our visions go rather further than that and our opportunities are unlimited.","It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.","I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine.","Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed.","Pilots take no special joy in walking. Pilots like flying.","Well, I think we tried very hard not to be overconfident, because when you get overconfident, that's when something snaps up and bites you.","I think we're going to the moon because it's in the nature of the human being to face challenges. It's by the nature of his deep inner soul... we're required to do these things just as salmon swim upstream.","I guess we all like to be recognized not for one piece of fireworks, but for the ledger of our daily work.","NASA has been one of the most successful public investments in motivating students to do well and achieve all they can achieve. It's sad that we are turning the programme in a direction where it will reduce the amount of motivation and stimulation it provides to young people.","People love conspiracy theories.","Geologists have a saying - rocks remember.","I am, and ever will be, a white socks, pocket protector, nerdy engineer.","Yeah, I wasn't chosen to be first. I was just chosen to command that flight. Circumstance put me in that particular role. That wasn't planned by anyone.","Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.","Gliders, sail planes, they're wonderful flying machines. It's the closest you can come to being a bird.","In much of society, research means to investigate something you do not know or understand.","All in all, for someone who was immersed in, fascinated by, and dedicated to flight, I was disappointed by the wrinkle in history that had brought me along one generation late. I had missed all the great times and adventures in flight.","I thought the attractions of being an astronaut were actually, not so much the Moon, but flying in a completely new medium.","As a boy, because I was born and raised in Ohio, about 60 miles north of Dayton, the legends of the Wrights have been in my memories as long as I can remember.","I fully expected that, by the end of the century, we would have achieved substantially more than we actually did.","Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind.","The Eagle has landed.","It's a brilliant surface in that sunlight. The horizon seems quite close to you because the curvature is so much more pronounced than here on earth. It's an interesting place to be. I recommend it.","I put up my thumb and it blotted out the planet Earth.","We had hundreds of thousands of people all dedicated to doing the perfect job, and I think they did about as well as anyone could ever have expected.","I can honestly say - and it's a big surprise to me - that I have never had a dream about being on the moon.","I'm substantially concerned about the policy directions of the space agency. We have a situation in the U.S. where the White House and Congress are at odds over what the future direction should be. They're sort of playing a game and NASA is the shuttlecock that they're hitting back and forth.","The one thing I regret was that my work required an enormous amount of my time, and a lot of travel.","I believe that every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine running around doing exercises.","If that's there, I believe that technology will probably step up to their part of it.","I was elated, ecstatic and extremely surprised that we were successful."],"Neil Burger":["I always think about what's the difference between being tenacious and having an inability to learn from failures. The difference between the homeless guy who wanted to be a great painter and the guy who is a great painter could be anything.","When I was younger, I wanted to own a circus and create this bizarre revue that went from town to town. I suppose, in a way, I got my wish because when you're working on a film, you're in a traveling circus.","I know the movies that I've liked, and I know the experience that they've given me, so the goal is always to try to create a movie that I would like myself and that would knock me out, challenge me or intrigue me in some way. That's been my criteria for figuring out what I want to do, or also when I'm writing something or creating a scene.","I really love New York, and I've lived here for a long time. I know not just the different neighborhoods but the different kind of class cultures in New York from the up-and-coming, down-and-out kind of artist to the powerful worlds of finance.","I think we all want something to knock us on the head and change our lives.","Sometimes I feel like just to get all my own work done would be great. You always feel like you're behind, and they're six other things that you wish you could get to but you can't."],"Neil Cavuto":["There's nothing wrong or evil about having a bad day. There's everything wrong with making others have to have it... with you.","I'm not staid and unbiased here. I have certain biases I want to convey, and if you disagree, that's fine.","We forget the little things, so it's no wonder some of us screw up the big things.","It's a good thing Winston Churchill was around before the shallow age of television. He might never have become one of the greatest leaders of all time.","I hate elitists. I hate conceited people. I hate pompous people.","I feel strongly that I need to try to make my shows as real as possible. What you see is what you get.","I want to democratize business news.","I don't think business news is just for old white men with money.","I'm not wedded to covering the markets. I'm intrigued by the markets. If I can connect Main Street with Wall Street, then I've succeeded.","I don't know if many people know this about me, but I have multiple sclerosis. So I don't have time for a lot of shades of gray. I don't have time for BS.","We're all going to die. While I'm still here, I want to make a difference.","I'll rail against what I think is wrong.","The good thing about having this illness is that it allows me to be a little bit crazy.","Sexy ain't guys like Churchill and Lincoln.","If Edwards gained 60 pounds and lost all his hair, he'd look like Dick Cheney!","Why the hell do we make such a big deal out of things that shouldn't be a big deal?","We're teaching our kids that attributes as vague and relatively meaningless as a toothy smile or a fine head of hair make a fine statement about a person.","I've known attractive airheads, and I've known ugly idiots.","It's not as if I can just pop on my show and be rude if I've had a hard day.","A lot of lawyers are set to tell me that it's not my fault I like to eat.","I'm the reason why I'm overweight. No one made me do it. I did it.","The tobacco companies knew quite early on the addictive nature of their product.","My dad was a big believer in treating people well, oftentimes even when he himself wasn't well.","It's sad that we have become so accustomed to bad service that we're shocked when we get good service.","The other day at a drive-through, I reminded the teenage girl serving me that she forgot my drinks. She looked at me, hissed, rolled her eyes, and then took her sweet time getting me the sodas.","We're a nation of liars. But I mean that in the kindest sense.","The rich pay more in total taxes now than ever before - ever. It's true. Just like it's true that when the rich are convinced they're going to be taxed more, they spend less. And when the top few percenters don't spend, there goes all your spending, because they account for half of all retail spending."],"Neil Cross":["To kind of go through life not caring is a spectacular attribute. It's one I wish I had.","I'd always read omnivorously and often thought much literary fiction is read by young men and women in their 20s as substitutes for experience.","People often express surprise that I'm not a psychopath. But it's not about what I want to do to other people, it's that I'm scared of what other people might do to me.","It's perceived as an accolade to be published as a 'literary' writer, but, actually, it's pompous and it's fake. Literary fiction is often nothing more than a genre in itself.","I don't get on with novelists, don't enjoy their company. Once you've worked for a publisher, you understand the species, see them in their natural habitat, and it's not always pretty.","I am very interested in theology. In fact, my first degree was in theology, so it's something that interests me greatly.","What I love about Indiana Jones is he always bites off slightly more than he can chew. The guy he's fighting is always slightly tougher than he is, but he just refuses to give up. And that's what makes Indiana Jones a hero: not his superpowers, but his refusal to be beaten.","I love to see heroes who fuel some kind of moral furnace inside them, who are driven to take on the evils of the world, despite the fact that the evils of the world are more powerful than them. And essentially can never be defeated, but they refuse to bow down. And in order to enjoy that aspect of the hero, you've got to put them through hell.","I had a complicated life until I was 25. I was born in Bristol and was brought up by my mum and my stepfather in Edinburgh. He introduced me to books.","I was writing novels at eight. It was a science fiction epic, which went by the unimprovable title of 'Another Kind of Warrior.' I'd write it beginning to end, but when I'd finished it, I was another year older. The quality of writing and thought changed radically, so I'd start it again. I re-wrote that same book until I was 16.","I wrote 'Mr. In-Between' very quickly when I was about 23. I wrote the penultimate chapter, then realised I'd done something which was written to the best of my abilities. I panicked. I hesitated to finish the final chapter and went into withdrawal for three years. I decided to pick it up again after I went drinking with author Tim Binding.","Writing a novel is an intense and lonely business, but you have the reward at the end of a very direct dialogue between you and the reader.","I love ghost stories, and I also have a great fondness and love for 'Quatermass,' which in many ways is the show that preceded 'Doctor Who.' 'Doctor Who' borrowed quite a bit from 'Quatermass' and probably wouldn't have existed in anything like the form we recognise today if 'Quatermass' hadn't come before it.","'Luther' is absolutely a monster-of-the-week show. Although it's post-watershed and is rendered in intense graphic novel-style images, it's inspiration is not that different from 'Doctor Who' as in both cases you've got a trickster figure who fights the monster of the week and is eventually successful.","The fictional character with whom I most profoundly identified was Yossarian in Catch-22. Always did, still do.","The thematic bucket of vomit that I've been chained to since I was about 9 is the moral complexity of anti-heroism. I have always been interested in good people who do bad things for understandable reasons."],"Neil Denari":["What I want to do is try to raise the level of SCI-Arc's original mission, which was to be forward-thinking. And let's face it, if you're forward-thinking and you're dealing in concepts of new ideas, history has told us that new ideas are not always wanted by everyone.","In L.A., cinema and television might be seen as more interesting places for architecture than ever before."],"Neil Diamond":["Brooklyn is not the easiest place to grow up in, although I wouldn't change that experience for anything.","I've looked at photographs of myself during concerts and it sometimes looks as if I'm in a fencing move, with a guitar in my hands instead of a sword.","I used to go to my kids' soccer games and I was the only parent who wasn't screaming, because I'd have to do a show that night. It was hard. Moms and dads get more emotional at those soccer and Little League games than at a professional game.","When you're on a merry-go-round, you miss a lot of the scenery.","It's very difficult for me to say 'I love you' but to sing 'I love you' for me is easier.","I came back to performing with a different attitude about performing and myself. I wasn't expecting perfection any more, just hoping for an occasional inspiration.","It was a real hand-to-mouth existence in those early days - I'd have whatever dry cereal there was in the house for breakfast, 30 cents to spend on lunch and a hot dog for dinner. I did that for years. So there was definitely a hunger in me, of various kinds, to succeed.","When I need my wife or when I need companionship or someone to talk to, I need it, like, now. So my wife will have to give up whatever she's doing at that moment to tend to my needs. And, in the same way, I would tend to hers. That's not such an easy thing to do.","I'm lucky. Hard work is the key, but luck plays a part.","Performing is the easiest part of what I do, and songwriting is the hardest.","I think probably Australians have just a little more taste than most people.","If it can affect me, if it has meaning to me, if I feel I can do it well, I will do it and record it and thats why I recorded these songs.","The main objective in any song, the songs that I write, has always been that it reflect the way I feel, that it touch me when I'm finished with it, that it moves me, that it can take me along with it and involve me in what its saying.","Chelsea Morning is a great Joni Mitchell song and I guess I'm partial to her lyrics because they show me a slightly different perspective on life.","I still need practice in enjoying the fruits of success.","The cardinal rule for any performer is that they should know themselves before they enter the spotlight, and I didn't. I was just Neil and I did what I was supposed to do. I was supposed to get married, so I got married. I was supposed to get a job, so I looked for work.","Because my musical training has been limited, I've never been restricted by what technical musicians might call a song.","I've always thought of music as something which gives the words their flight and their wings and the music often comes first, although sometimes I'll have a concept, a title idea, a lyric idea that I want to write and the lyric will come first.","I don't like all of the music to be serious and deadly.","There's a mystery to writing, and you don't really know where most of it comes from.","No, I majored in biology, in a pre-med program.","Songwriting is different from music, although I don't deny now that it would be nice to have a little more background in music theory.","Song Sung Blue took a lot of compressing and refining, and it has one of my favorite lyrics.","Songwritng is what I do.","Songs are life in 80 words or less.","I'm throwing myself back in because I like being married. I don't want to end this whole fabulous journey alone. I want someone by my side who I love and who loves me. I've finally found somebody who's up to the task of being my wife, because I'm very high maintenance.","I may have a little bit of a talent for music, but I've learnt to tap into my own self when I write. When I put the drill bit inside my heart, sometimes I come up with something light and frothy, sometimes with something deep and painful, but it's great to connect with the audience.","I didn't want to repeat my mistakes so I stopped, took some time out and started having therapy. My songs were bringing up feelings inside of me I didn't really understand, so I wanted to understand where they were coming from to help me be a better person and a better songwriter.","I don't feel I have to write deep and meaningful songs; they can be light and meaningless. It has to do with the place I am in my life, a really good place.","I definitely don't feel like I'm 71. I feel like I did when I was - between 30 and 40. The body ages. The mind doesn't.","I like having a woman. I like having someone to come home to, to make all of the hard work feel worth it. I need someone with me. And I want someone.","You can't plan to write a great song. It just happens to you. It drops in your lap. It's the same thing with a woman."],"Neil Finn":["Our motto is whenever you make a mistake, do it twice.","It took me a long time, but I don't feel as anxious about stupid things anymore - or perhaps they've just been replaced by more complicated stupid things.","So I think rather than being attracted so much now to working with my heroes, I'm sort of more attracted to working with completely unlikely strangers because it's more exciting really.","I'm a lifer, yeah... I can honestly say I'm a lifer.","I love being in the studio.","We used to say that he who threw the biggest tantrum won the day.","I try to put myself into unusual and difficult situations as often as I can in order to capture the element of struggle in the music."],"Neil Flynn":["I wouldn't say I'm a fan of Tarantino, per se, but I like several of his movies very much, probably 'Reservoir Dogs' the most of them.","I was so intimidated by the thought of improvising back in the '80s when I was in Chicago. I think the opportunity only even came up once that I can recall, and I turned down the offer. It was to go improvise in some club in the suburbs or something. Good God, I couldn't think of anything more frightening than to get up there without a plan.","I saw 'Animal House' in the theater the night before I left for college. And for better or worse, it made an impression. Within a week, I was in a fraternity myself.","On 'Scrubs,' I played a very unusual character who pretty much was defined by saying and doing strange things, so it was easy to improvise around that.","While 'The Middle' is still funny for adults to watch, there aren't sex jokes. And I'm fine with that. I like the idea that my nieces and nephews can watch it without their parents.","I've always liked shows that have a strong cast of secondary characters. One of the greatest examples ever I would say is 'The Simpsons.' If you think about it, you could name 100 characters recognizable from that show. I think 'Scrubs' has done a good job of having a strong team coming off the bench.","I probably remember more about 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' than Dick Van Dyke does.","I think 'Mean Girls' was a kind of significant movie. It was a very successful comedy, and it was also before 'Bridesmaids,' and it really launched some of today's biggest women in comedy.","I have nothing to do with Facebook or the Internet - I don't know how to use half of it; I think I'm better off."],"Neil Gaiman":["I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something.","The one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can.","A library is a place that is a repository of information and gives every citizen equal access to it. That includes health information. And mental health information. It's a community space. It's a place of safety, a haven from the world.","Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens up your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up.","Short stories are tiny windows into other worlds and other minds and dreams. They are journeys you can make to the far side of the universe and still be back in time for dinner.","As an author, I've never forgotten how to daydream.","I've never known anyone who was what he or she seemed; or at least, was only what he or she seemed. People carry worlds within them.","The world always seems brighter when you've just made something that wasn't there before.","And there never was an apple, in Adam's opinion, that wasn't worth the trouble you got into for eating it.","As far as I'm concerned, the entire reason for becoming a writer is not having to get up in the morning.","I'm never, I hope, stupid enough to believe that Twitter or blogging or any of this stuff is a substitute for actually doing the work or writing a book.","I've been blogging since February of 2001. When I started blogging, it was a dinosaur blog. It was me and a handful of tyrannosaurs. We'd be writing blog entries like, 'The tyrannosaurus is getting grumpy.'","It has always been the prerogative of children and half-wits to point out that the emperor has no clothes. But the half-wit remains a half-wit, and the emperor remains an emperor.","It is a fool's prerogative to utter truths that no one else will speak.","Empathy is a tool for building people into groups, for allowing us to function as more than self-obsessed individuals.","I believe that stories are incredibly important, possibly in ways we don't understand, in allowing us to make sense of our lives, in allowing us to escape our lives, in giving us empathy and in creating the world that we live in.","The imagination is a muscle. If it is not exercised, it atrophies.","Life is always going to be stranger than fiction, because fiction has to be convincing, and life doesn't.","Things need not have happened to be true. Tales and adventures are the shadow truths that will endure when mere facts are dust and ashes and forgotten.","A nice, easy place for freedom of speech to be eroded is comics, because comics are a natural target whenever an election comes up.","You get ideas from daydreaming. You get ideas from being bored. You get ideas all the time. The only difference between writers and other people is we notice when we're doing it.","The short story is still like the novel's wayward younger brother, we know that it's not respectable - but I think that can also add to the glory of it.","Write your story as it needs to be written. Write it honestly, and tell it as best you can. I'm not sure that there are any other rules. Not ones that matter.","I don't know if any single book made me want to write. C.S. Lewis was the first writer to make me aware that somebody was writing the book I was reading - these wonderful parenthetical asides to the reader.","I've known ambitious people with no aptitude for the thing they did. Most of whom, rather terrifyingly, tended to succeed.","Also, I've already won all the awards.","I think the short story is a very underrated art form. We know that novels deserve respect.","This is a work of fiction. All the characters in it, human and otherwise, are imaginary, excepting only certain of the fairy folk, whom it might be unwise to offend by casting doubts on their existence. Or lack thereof.","I lost some time once. It's always in the last place you look for it.","The biggest difference between England and America is that England has history, while America has geography.","'Doctor Who' was the first mythology that I learned, before ever I ran into Greek or Roman or Egyptian mythologies.","Going off the grid is always good for me. It's the way that I've started books and finished books and gotten myself out of deadline dooms and things.","I think of myself as a very lazy author.","When I started out, there were a lot of things I knew I couldn't do, and a lot of things I only found out I couldn't do by going and doing it. And no-one was watching, and nobody cared.","Sometimes the best way to learn something is by doing it wrong and looking at what you did.","We all not only could know everything. We do. We just tell ourselves we don't to make it all bearable.","I loved writing a book in which, in some ways, it's very, very classical, and in some ways I'm breaking lots of rules about what you can do and what you can't do.","So the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund is out there preserving and fighting for, and sometimes winning and sometimes losing, the fight for First Amendment rights in comics and, more generally, for freedom of speech.","It's not a bad thing for a writer not to feel at home. Writers - we're much more comfortable at parties standing in the corner watching everybody else having a good time than we are mingling.","You can take for granted that people know more or less what a street, a shop, a beach, a sky, an oak tree look like. Tell them what makes this one different.","In the case of 'Ocean at the End of the Lane,' it's a book about helplessness. It's a book about family, it's a book about being 7 in a world of people who are bigger than you, and more dangerous, and stepping into territory that you don't entirely understand.","Every now and then I'll do little things, a short story or something, that doesn't have any fantastical elements, but mostly I like the power of playing God and I like to imagine things.","My guiltiest pleasure is Harry Stephen Keeler. He may have been the greatest bad writer America has ever produced. Or perhaps the worst great writer. I do not know. There are few faults you can accuse him of that he is not guilty of. But I love him.","As a kid, I would get my parents to drop me off at my local library on their way to work during the summer holidays, and I would walk home at night. For several years, I read the children's library until I finished the children's library. Then I moved into the adult library and slowly worked my way through them.","Oh, tweeting prolifically is the most easy thing in the world. Tweeting prolifically is like somebody saying, 'Boy, you're a really good walker around,' you know. It's not really hard.","I don't think there is such a thing as a bad book for children.","You know, it's weird being interviewed! Because the weird thing about being interviewed is you get asked these questions that you've never thought about, and you find out what you think as you answer.","When I was a kid, we actually lived in a house that had been divided in two at one point, which meant that one room in our house opened up onto a brick wall. And I was convinced all I had to do was just open it the right way and it wouldn't be a brick wall. So I'd sidle over to the door and I'd pull it open.","American Gods is about 200,000 words long, and I'm sure there are words that are simply in there 'cause I like them. I know I couldn't justify each and every one of them.","Because, if one is writing novels today, concentrating on the beauty of the prose is right up there with concentrating on your semi-colons, for wasted effort.","Great, big, serious novels always get awards. If it's a battle between a great, big, serious novel and a funny novel, the funny novel is doomed.","I don't know if proud is the right word, but I am somebody who does not, on the whole, have the highest regard for my own stuff in that when I look all I get to see are the flaws.","I started writing when I was about 20, 21 maybe.","I wanted to write something that would be a comedy in the sense of making people feel happier when they finish it than they did when began it.","I was always so relieved that anyone wants to publish anything I've written.","I'll agonize over sentences. Mostly because you're trying to create specific effects with sentences, and because there are a number of different voices in the book.","I'm a fairly undisciplined writer.","I'm one of those writers who tends to be really good at making outlines and sticking to them. I'm very good at doing that, but I don't like it. It sort of takes a lot of the fun out.","In many ways, it was much, much harder to get the first book contract. The hardest thing probably overall has been learning not to trust people, publicists and so forth, implicitly.","Life - and I don't suppose I'm the first to make this comparison - is a disease: sexually transmitted, and invariably fatal.","Partly because I get such astonishingly nice fans.","Rock and roll stars have it much better than writers when they're on a tour.","So I went out and bought myself a copy of the Writer and Artist Yearbook, bought lots of magazines and got on the phone and talked to editors about ideas for stories. Pretty soon I found myself hired to do interviews and articles and went off and did them.","The current total of countries in the world with First Amendments is one. You have guaranteed freedom of speech. Other countries don't have that.","There's a glorious sense of freedom in comedy, just allowing myself to tell jokes, allowing myself to interrupt myself and tell old African folk stories that I made up - or didn't - and Jamaican stories.","Is the chemical aftertaste the reason why people eat hot dogs, or is it some kind of bonus?","I was the kind of kid whose parents would drop him off at the local town library on their way to work, and I'd go and work my way through the children's area.","I was one those kids who had books on them. Before weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, funerals and anything else where you're actually meant to not be reading, my family would frisk me and take the book away. If they didn't find it by this point in the procedure, I would be sitting over in that corner completely unnoticed just reading my book.","I started out writing much more science fictiony stuff and writing about science fiction.","The moment that you feel that just possibly you are walking down the street naked... that's the moment you may be starting to get it right.","Make good art.","Like some kind of particularly tenacious vampire the short story refuses to die, and seems at this point in time to be a wonderful length for our generation.","The simplest way to make sure that we raise literate children is to teach them to read, and to show them that reading is a pleasurable activity.","When I was 7, my proudest possession would have been my bookshelf 'cause I had alphabetized all of the books on my bookshelf.","A good writer should be able to write comedic work that made you laugh, and scary stuff that made you scared, and fantasy or science fiction that imbued you with a sense of wonder, and mainstream journalism that gave you clear and concise information in a way that you wanted it.","The joy of doing 'Sandman' was doing a comic and telling people, 'No, it has an end,' at a time when nobody thought you could actually get to the end and stop doing a comic that people were still buying just because you'd finished.","My stuff gets published in some countries as fiction and in some countries as fantasy. It's just where they think it will do best in the bookshops.","I don't think I'm mainstream. I think what I am is lots and lots of different cults. And when you get lots and lots of small groups who like you a lot, they add up to a big group without ever actually becoming mainstream.","I like reading. I prefer not reading on my computer, because that makes whatever I am reading feel like work. I do not mind reading on my iPad.","As a teenager I wrote to R.A. Lafferty. And he responded, too, with letters that were like R.A. Lafferty short stories, filled with elliptical answers to straight questions and simple answers to complicated ones.","I was a scholarship minor public school day boy at Ardingly College and later Whitgift School. Then, straight into work as a journalist - a wonderful thing for a writer.","I wish being a beekeeper, which I am, gave you a free pass on the carbon footprint, but it doesn't.","One thing that I get from a lot of people with 'American Gods' is people saying that they would love some kind of glossary with a list of all the Gods and who they are, so that they can look them up.","I'm English, and 'Doctor Who' was this thing that I've been watching since I was three.","It's a wonderful thing, as a writer, to be given parameters and walls and barriers.","When you're starting off as a young writer, you look at all the stuff that's gone before and the stuff that's influenced you, and you reach the ladle of your imagination into this bubbling stew pot of all of this stuff, and you pour it out. And that's where you start from.","What I'd love to do is every now and then go, 'Oh my God, I've got this amazing idea for 'Doctor Who.'","I had started to feel that somewhere in the second half of the 20th century, the idea of page-turning as a good thing had been lost. You were getting books that were the equivalent of absolutely beautifully prepared dishes of food that didn't taste like anything much.","My theory on genre is that while there are people out there who believe that genre tells people what to read, actually I believe that genre exists as a marketing tool to tell you what to avoid.","I kept starting 'Anansi Boys' as a movie and stopping, and eventually wrote the novel and was happy.","Anything that keeps you happy and writing is part of my writing ritual: I like music, so I tend to have it playing in the background. But if I'm interested, I can write in an airport waiting areas.","Continuity isn't actually something that I ever worry about. You use it where you need to, and you don't use it where you don't need to.","It's a given that we exist in a world where we have to live in continuity every day; no one is immune to that, in life or romance novels. By the same token, it's not something I find terribly important.","The great thing about Batman and Superman, in truth, is that they are literally transcendent. They are better than most of the stories they are in.","'American Gods' was designed to be, if not open-ended, at least a trilogy kind of shape, so there's definitely one more book, probably another couple of books there to get written.","When I was young, I was reading anything and anything I could lay my hands on. I was a veracious-to-the-point-of-insane reader.","I started blogging a decade ago because I like blogging. Writing's a kind of lonely thing to do, and I liked the idea of demystifying the process because I loved it as a kid and teenager and as somebody who wanted desperately to write.","With 'Stardust', I hope what I was doing is giving 30-year-olds and 40-year-olds and 25-year-olds and 60-year-olds a chance to get the same sense of wonder, the same feeling, the same magic, that they got in reading the classic fairy tales as children.","The first author I remember being obsessed by, actually realizing 'I like the way he writes and I like the way he tells stories,' was C.S. Lewis and the 'Narnia' books.","I suspect there are two kinds of novelists. Those who have a point of view and have something to say and then write a novel in order to say that thing, and those of us who write the book in order to find out what we think about that thing.","I want to write a play. I'd like to do an original musical. I should probably put together a poetry collection.","For me, the glory of my first 25 years as a writer was I could put things off as long as I wanted.","The only people I ever get irritated with are the ones who announce, using my Twitter handle, that they are no longer following me and why."],"Neil Gershenfeld":["You don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it. You need it for what makes you unique, just like personalization.","Computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened to either computers or to science.","We've had a digital revolution, but we don't need to keep having it. And I'd like to look after that, to look what comes after the digital revolution.","Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded. So, half as much grain is half as much useful, but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer, and we've been trying to make computers that work that way.","The real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems.","If anyone can make anything, anywhere. It fundamentally changes the meaning of business."],"Neil Gorsuch":["American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education.","A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge... stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.","All human beings are intrinsically valuable, and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong.","Far from definitively resolving the assisted suicide issue, the court's decisions seem to assure that the debate over assisted suicide and euthanasia is not yet over - and may have only begun.","I respect, too, the fact that in our legal order it is for Congress and not the courts to write new laws. It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people's representatives.","Justice Scalia was a lion of the law. Agree or disagree with him, all of his colleagues on the bench shared his wisdom and his humor. And like them, I miss him.","Judges should be in the business of declaring what the law is using the traditional tools of interpretation, rather than pronouncing the law as they might wish it to be in light of their own political views.","Ours is the job of interpreting the Constitution. And that document isn't some inkblot on which litigants may project their hopes and dreams.","It would be a very good thing for all involved - the country, an independent judiciary, and the Left itself - if liberals take a page from David von Drehle and their own judges of the New Deal era, kick their addiction to constitutional litigation, and return to their New Deal roots of trying to win elections rather than lawsuits.","In the balance of my professional life, I've had the privilege of the working as a practicing lawyer and teacher.","Practicing in the trial work trenches of the law, I saw, too, that when we judges don our robes, it doesn't make us any smarter, but it does serve as a reminder of what's expected of us: Impartiality and independence, collegiality and courage.","I consider the United States Senate the greatest deliberative body in the world, and I respect the important role the Constitution affords it in the confirmation of our judges.","Of course, the Supreme Court's work is vital not just to a region of the country, but to the whole, vital to the protection of the people's liberties under law and to the continuity of our Constitution, the greatest charter of human liberty the world has ever known.","Though the critics are loud and the temptations to join them may be many, mark me down too as a believer that the traditional account of the judicial role Justice Scalia defended will endure.","Some of the most impressive judicial nominees are grossly mistreated.","Standing here in a house of history, and acutely aware of my own imperfections, I pledge that if I am confirmed I will do all my powers permit to be a faithful servant of the Constitution and laws of this great country.","For the last decade, I've worked as a federal judge in a court that spans six Western states, serving about 20 percent of the continental United States and about 18 million people. The men and women I've worked with at every level in our circuit are an inspiration to me.","I began my legal career working for Byron White, the last Coloradan to serve on the Supreme Court, and the only justice to lead the N.F.L. in rushing. He was one of the smartest and most courageous men I've ever known.","When Justice White retired, he gave me the chance to work for Justice Kennedy, as well. Justice Kennedy was incredibly welcoming and gracious, and like Justice White, he taught me so much. I am forever grateful. And if you've ever met Judge David Sentelle, you'll know just how lucky I was to land a clerkship with him right out of school.","We seek to protect and preserve life for life's own sake in everything from our most fundamental laws of homicide to our road traffic regulations to our largest governmental programs for health and social security.","We have all witnessed, as well, family, friends, or medical workers who have chosen to provide years of loving care to persons who may suffer from Alzheimer's or other debilitating illnesses precisely because they are human persons, not because doing so instrumentally advances some other hidden objective.","Throughout my decade on the bench, I have watched my colleagues strive day in and day out to do just as Socrates said we should - to hear courteously, answer wisely, consider soberly, and decide impartially.","In the legislative arena, especially when the country is closely divided, compromises tend to be the rule the day. But when judges rule this or that policy unconstitutional, there's little room for compromise: One side must win, the other must lose.","Where trial-court and appeals-court nominees were once routinely confirmed on voice vote, they are now routinely subjected to ideological litmus tests, filibusters, and vicious interest-group attacks.","During the New Deal, liberals recognized that the ballot box and elected branches are generally the appropriate engines of social reform, and liberals used both to spectacular effect - instituting profound social changes that remain deeply ingrained in society today."],"Neil Harbisson":["Kids are really inspired to not just apply senses to robots and machines, but to try them on themselves.","We need to get used to seeing humans with antennas sticking out of their heads.","If we extend our senses, then, consequently, we will extend our knowledge. It's really very basic.","Color is everywhere, so everything has changed. I still can't see color, but I can perceive it. I can experience it in a way that allows me to be a part of this reality, which I was excluded from before. Thanks to the eyeborg, I've made a career by combining music and art.","There's no legal protection for cyborgs. In 2010, I started the Cyborg Foundation to defend our rights. Cyborgs have been kicked out from several places because they are seen as a possible security threat. I've been kicked out from places such as Harrods, Casino Montecarlo, and many supermarkets.","The biggest challenge for cyborgs is to be socially accepted. Society needs to accept that there are people who wish to use technology as part of the body.","We should find inspiration in the senses that already exist and try to copy them and apply them to us. If we compare our senses to the senses of other animals and species that we don't have, we can get ideas for new abilities that we can adapt to humans by applying cybernetics to the body.","It's strange that we create tech and then we apply it to machines, when we could apply it to ourselves. Cars can now detect if something is behind them, but we don't have this ability. Why are we applying such a simple sense to a car when we could apply it to ourselves?"],"Neil Innes":["Eric Clapton always wanted to come out onstage with a stuffed parrot on his shoulder.","In fact, Moon came on tour with us for a bit just before a big festival in Brighton, I think.","Ladies and gentleman, I've suffered for my music, now it's your turn.","We weren't going to play the show-biz game, and be obsequious.","But we used to go to flea markets and things, and look for old 78 records that had silly song titles.","So we used to look for funny songs, and learn them and play them. And we used to play them in pubs.","We then took a shortened version of what we'd been doing in the pubs, with the best gags and things like that, out to cabaret clubs and things in the north of England for six weeks. And we became a big success.","I mean Gorilla was really our first sort of goes at songwriting.","I wasn't aware that Track Records were interested in the Bonzos.","I mean in recent years, I think you've only got to sell thirty or forty thousand to get a #1.","But I remember we sold nearly 18,000 records in one day.","As I said, when we needed to move over to rock'n'roll, Sam and Vernon couldn't quite make the shift. So that's when Larry took over on drums, and we needed a bass player.","But Dennis was a really solid musician, and we really needed somebody who could play bass like him.","Because Larry, by then, was a drummer, who would sort of get bored and tired, and rather stand up and blow kisses to people. So we needed the bass to sort of drive along.","In many ways, Viv and I were the only ones who were really songwriters.","Larry only ever wrote one song, and he wrote that with Tony Kaye, I think it was, from Yes.","But mostly, I wrote songs and Viv wrote songs.","I used to help Viv with the chords and melodies sometimes.","I see my role in the Bonzos as being the straight man, in many ways.","We weren't by any means like the Grateful Dead or something, who could just roll on and on and on.","Viv had this kind of stage presence where you couldn't ignore it. He walked onstage, he looked dangerous. You just didn't know what he was going to do.","And Roger was crazy with his robots and everything.","I suppose Roger had the license to do anything that fitted the venue.","I suppose we all loved those kind of sci-fi movies where terrible things came out of swamps and came to Mars. And there's usually some poor girl. All the guys are trying to desperately handle levers and saying, go to something or other.","It was just us lampooning our own peer group, saying, well hey, where did this stuff come from? And where does British guys get to be so good at it suddenly?","But I mean, again, Zappa's far more musical than the Bonzos ever were.","I think most musicians do like to have a laugh.","When we did Top of the Pops for the third time, we decided to do it as a television program here called Come Dancing, which is not as rude as it sounds."],"Neil Jackson":["When I was a young kid, the best stuff on television was always the BBC period dramas - it was what we sat down as a family to watch and what people talked about and looked forward to.","It's funny - when I first started as an actor, obviously there were long periods of being idle and all you want to do is work. So if I ever get the compulsion to feel like I should complain or feel like I want to take a break, I just remember how I was before and be very grateful for it.","I've played a lot of villains. The villains are always fun because you can just go fractionally bigger than life. It's always a grey area because you don't want to end up mustache-twirling and making them a little false, but you always get to play a little more, whereas the lead guy has to be a little more straight.","As an artist, you want to make good stories and create good art; as a businessman, you want to make money and make sure the investors are happy. The two will always clash, unfortunately.","I think people are always going to be fascinated about the haves and have nots - about the divide between the servants and the rich families upstairs.","People abusing their power makes me see red.","I'd like to be an inventor, as they look at the world in a different way and find solutions for making it better.","I love stories - devising them, writing them, reading them, watching them, being a part of them.","Being an actor, you can get spoilt a little bit: car services come and pick you up, you get put up in nice hotels, people fetch you coffee, and so on. It is wonderful, but you can get lost in that world pretty quickly and start believing that it is real life.","We live in such a consumer-based world. Everything we do, someone else has provided for us, so there is something really empowering about knowing that once I have found the right pieces of wood, I can start a fire and keep myself warm and skin an animal to eat and make its skin into leather.","When I was eight, my mum found me humming to myself and scribbling on a scrap of paper. When she asked me what I was doing, I got shy. I was writing a Christmas song, and I had never shared my music with anyone before. Reluctantly, I sang it for her... and she loved it. Of course she did - she's my mum.","For my 23rd birthday, I received a nylon string guitar. I told myself that if I could play Eric Clapton's 'Tears In Heaven,' then I could play the guitar. I practised every chance I got, driving my housemates insane, until several weeks later I had a shaky version of the song down. I wrote my first song on the guitar a few weeks after that.","I didn't have the money to put myself through drama school, so I thought - naively - that if I wrote a play and put it on at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, agents would see me and that would be my ticket to Hollywood. I wrote a musical; an acting coach saw it and put me on his course for free while I wrote for his company.","The women in 'Downton Abbey' don't compare to the women in 'Upstairs Downstairs.' Ours are stunning. We've got Laura Haddock, Keeley Hawes, Claire Foy... beautiful women."],"Neil Jordan":["The Company of Wolves is about how society teaches young women to look at themselves, and what to be afraid of. It's about a girl learning that the world of sensuality and the unknown is not to be feared, that it's worth getting your teeth into.","There's no point in making a film out of a great book. The book's already great. What's the point?","And I think I often choose to do something because it's quite different from what I've done before.","But everyone gets burnt, don't they? Certain things are outside of your control. I suppose the only thing you can learn as a director is to not put yourself into situations where it can get outside of your control. And that's what happened.","Films have gotten leaner and leaner, cutting out all variations from the story line.","For me now, it's about what you would write and what you wouldn't write, and that's how I select what I am going to do. It can be quite nice being brought a concept by a studio for me to work on.","For me, the filmmaking has to be about the dramaturgy.","I can't do a film if I don't start with the writing.","I do enjoy working with writers.","I took two years away from making films to write a novel.","I'm less comfortable making American movies because I don't know them so well.","I've also worked hard portraying an Ireland which is fast disappearing. Ireland was a very depressed and difficult place in the 1980s, and I've tried to include that in the script. I worked really hard to find the heart of the book.","I've had three novels published, and I was working a little bit in theater in Ireland. I wrote one film script just to see what it would turn out like.","Initially with The Butcher Boy, there was this kid growing up in this strange, weird environment that I remember from when I was a kid. And Patrick's vision was so complete there.","It is extremely difficult to get movies that cost more than $40 million to be made these days.","It's hard to know whether certain characters come to life or not, they either come to have their own life or they don't. I've written many things in which the characters just remain inert.","It's nice to work with Hollywood because there is never any question of resources put at your disposal to make a film as long as it is the right thing to do.","It's the opposite journey from what I've usually done with films. I find it very easy to go from, say, a lit, pleasurable environment, like what you see outside there, to a very dark place. But the opposite journey, which is what this movie takes, is much more complicated.","It's the same thing in a way, although writing a book is a very solitary thing.","My conception of it was that in a normal film you have a story with different movements that program, develop, go a little bit off the trunk, come back, and end.","Never make a promise - you may have to keep it.","No, I just thought of a story and wrote down what I saw. It was about two kids in Ireland who went around killing people. It was called Travelers, and it was made as an independent film.","The Company of Wolves doesn't belong in any category, so it's difficult to prepare an audience for it. It's not a horror film, it's not a fantasy film, it's not a children's film - so what is it?","The End of the Affair is almost like a play.","The most difficult thing is the organization of people and the expression of your intentions. It's very easy to have a picture in your head and to imagine that you've told everybody about what you need.","Well, Company of Wolves was about that literally, about fairy tales.","Well, I suppose I'm interested in ways of storytelling and in stories that are about storytelling.","Well, if you're talking about the current climate, there's a lack of content in American film because I think people are deeply confused about their emotions, and they don't regret certain aspects of their own foreign policy.","When you've written a movie, you then get together with a whole lot of people and make it. In many ways, I think it is far nicer to be with people rather than being completely solitary.","Why should a horror film be just a horror film? To me, The Company of Wolves is a fairy tale; it's got all those elements plus a lot more. And we know that fairy tales aren't innocent any more.","I mean I grew up in Ireland, so one would have to be consciously blinkered not to have reflected on the issue of political violence because that was the story since I was 19 years old or 20.","In Dreams... well, I was slightly overcompensating with that. I was a bit like a director for hire, so maybe I was putting too much imagery that was familiar to me into it."],"Neil Kinnock":["The enemy of idealism is zealotry.","The unforgivable political sin is vanity; the killer diet is sour grapes.","I warn you not to be ordinary, I warn you not to be young, I warn you not to fall ill, and I warn you not to grow old.","Margaret Thatcher was not a malicious person. She was a person who couldn't see, or didn't want to see, the unfairness and disadvantaging consequences of the application of what she thought to be a renewing ideology.","The Parthenon without the marbles is like a smile with a tooth missing.","Loyalty is a fine quality, but in excess it fills political graveyards.","I didn't call for a ballot at the start of the miners' strike in 1984. I'll regret that until my dying day.","I would die for my country but I could never let my country die for me.","Is Tony Blair of the Labour party? The answer to that is profoundly 'yes', but that is not how, sentimentally, he is regarded in the Labour movement generally.","You cannot fashion a wit out of two half-wits.","Do something that makes a difference - because, by God, there's a lot to make you angry.","No prime minister in Britain will ever be able to go to war without the endorsement of a majority of the House of Commons.","People who are in politics to be right all the time would be better off taking up fly-fishing. It's less dangerous. Politics that is not applied in the real world and doesn't address the real challenges and paradoxes and agonies is a hobby.","I take notice of those who have argued consistently for the modernisation of the E.U., but so many of the skeptics in Britain are just hostile to the whole European idea.","In the U.K. the far Right is a stain on society and there is a cultural resistance to it.","Newspapers are tutors as well as informers.","People, even independently minded people, do to an extent draw their impressions from what they are told, especially if they are told it incessantly by newspapers.","My first real experience of ambition was as party leader. It was my ambition for Labour to win, in which event I would be prime minister.","I'm the guy everybody wanted to live next door. They just didn't want me to be prime minister.","If we are going to have a bicameral parliament, I think there should always be a reserved place for people whose background and experience are critical to the welfare of the nation.","There are politicians who seethe with ambition all the time, and there are a lot of other politicians who don't. I'm in the second category, that's all.","I'd like to be remembered as somebody who tried to promote justice."],"Neil Kurshan":["Walk a mile in my shoes is good advice. Our children will learn to respect others if they are used to imagining themselves in another's place.","Family life is not a computer program that runs on its own; it needs continual input from everyone.","It is at once the most overwhelmingly frustrating and exasperating task and the most joyous and rewarding experience to make human beings out of children.","Morality is not only taught; it is caught.","Allowing children to spew forth whatever is on their minds in the name of openness only creates an illusion of family closeness."],"Neil LaBute":["We live in a disposable society. It's easier to throw things out than to fix them. We even give it a name - we call it recycling.","People think my work is therapeutic. I don't see it that way. It's not like I'm saving money from a weekly therapy visit by writing down my life.","Relationships in general make people a bit nervous. It's about trust. Do I trust you enough to go there?","Everybody has the ability to be manipulative, to be hateful and deceitful.","Everyone has a story.","We humans are a fairly barbarous bunch.","Everyone has a little bit of Howard and Chad in them. I think there's Christine in all men as well.","I didn't choose BYU, I like to think it chose me.","I have a healthy view of what one can do with art.","I make movies I want to see.","I see bits and pieces of me in all the characters in my films.","I wanted to tell a story that interested me as much in the telling as in the watching.","I was always looking for the most dramatic emphasis.","I would be more frightened as a writer if people thought my movies were like science fiction.","I'm more than open to hope, but I think men and women have a difficult time dealing with each other and often take the low road.","If we put the camera on ourselves, our friends and neighbors, we'll come up with some scary stuff.","In a relationship you have to open yourself up.","My best male friend is my best friend until he crosses me. We're all protective of the self.","People have perhaps gotten to the point where for the most part movies are a just bit of escape.","Unrequited love is always a great thing.","Without In The Company of Men, I could still be teaching, so who knows if this would've existed.","First I would probably place men at the bottom of the food chain. On a grander scale, I would say they're reacting to change. Feminism has got to be part of that.","I think Christine and Chad are on the opposite extremes of the spectrum. Christine is a model victim, and Chad is a model perpetrator, and Howard is closer to the middle.","I wanted to make these people real, not like they were in a painting. Like these are people who don't know they're in a period movie. Those concerns are incredibly immediate.","I was very careful to cast guys who were very good-looking and very fit and who had a certain sense of privilege about them, because with that sense of privilege comes contempt.","My business is can I create a world that's possible and could happen? I think that's the only thing that I have to do, and I think that I have done that each time.","With In the Company of Men, the misogynist label stuck early and firmly. In the end, it probably did hurt the film a bit, because getting women into the theaters was difficult.","You start as an audience member and create a world you're interested in, and then you move into the telling of those stories, bringing what has interested you as an audience member.","But even with a character like Cary who is relatively outlandish, at the end of the movie he's in a place where I wouldn't have expected him to be - taking on the responsibility of a woman who is pregnant and who used to be his best friend's wife.","But for me, it feels like a natural extension of what I've been doing: exploring relationships. Here you have two relationships and we can explore how difficult it is for people to be together.","I think the more the actor lets you know what he thinks of the character, the less the audience cares - like a comedian who laughs at his own jokes.","I will say that the idea of a woman being deceptive came from that original discussion with critics and reporters about if woman could do that kind of thing. Evelyn, herself, grew out of the discussions about how capable women are of deceit and lying and manipulation.","Just in the past few years - since I've been making movies, which isn't a very long time - you now have a culture that is fascinated and informed about the box office in a way that sometimes filmmakers weren't even.","There is a lot of absurdity sometimes, not just in Mormonism but often in other religions that want to pretend that no bad happens in their church, rather than taking care of what bad does happen."],"Neil MacGregor":["The British Museum was founded with a civic purpose: to allow the citizen, through reasoned inquiry and comparison, to resist the certainties that endanger free society and are still among the greatest threats to our liberty.","A collection that embraces the whole world allows you to consider the whole world. That is what an institution such as the British Museum is for.","Prometheus - trickster, rebel and hero - links the realm of the gods with the world of humanity, with which he had such close affinity. His act of stealing fire has been viewed as the foundation of all man's technologies.","The collapse of the Tower of Babel is perhaps the central urban myth. It is certainly the most disquieting. In Babylon, the great city that fascinated and horrified the Biblical writers, people of different races and languages, drawn together in pursuit of wealth, tried for the first time to live together - and failed.","The things we make have one supreme quality - they live longer than us. We perish, they survive; we have one life, they have many lives, and in each life they can mean different things. Which means that, while we all have one biography, they have many.","The Louvre stopped buying paintings in 1848, and neither the Metropolitan nor the Hermitage acquire contemporary material.","While there are few records of Viking women participating in battle, they certainly held positions of high status in society as human sorceresses known as 'volvas.'","The spread of Viking bling is a good indication of the spread of its culture.","In a very literal way, of course, Shakespeare did change the course of history: when it didn't fit the plot he had in mind, he simply rewrote it. His English histories play fast and loose with chronology and fact to achieve the desired dramatic effect, re-ordering history even as it was then understood.","Creation stories, so central in the religions of the Middle East, play a surprisingly marginal part in Greek myth. The Greeks had nothing to set alongside the resounding 'In the beginning' in the book of Genesis, where one eternal God creates the universe out of nothing.","For the Greeks, there was no single canonical version of creation, but a number of overlapping stories.","Google the name Prometheus, and see how often it has been given to innovations in many different fields, notably science, medicine and space exploration. The fire he stole can be seen, too, as the spark generating all artistic creativity.","It is a standing source of astonishment and amusement to visitors that the British Museum has so few British things in it: that it is a museum about the world as seen from Britain rather than a history focused on these islands.","Thanks to the unprecedented reach of British navigation, London in the early 18th century was not just the emporium of the world, it was the first place in which it was possible to assemble artifacts from around the world and allow people to study them.","As the Persians wrote very little about how they ran their affairs, the Greek propaganda of the 5th century B.C. has for centuries gone virtually unchallenged - indeed, for Edward Said, it was the beginning of Europe's long habit of misunderstanding and ill-informed contempt of the Middle East.","Hardest of all for Europeans to negotiate are traditional African religions, whose transactions with unseen powers are central to the running of life in many areas, the main weapon in the struggle against the forces of evil.","For many, the icon of the British Museum is the Rosetta Stone, that administrative by-product of the Greek imperial adventure in Africa.","The deciphering of ancient scripts changed forever the way Europeans were able to imagine the story of humanity, destroying centuries of received authority about the past with repercussions as important for our understanding of time and history as the geological studies of the same period.","Saddam Hussein was fascinated by ancient Babylon and Assyria. He made money available to protect and develop the great archaeological sites. The great achievements of Mesopotamian civilisation were pressed into the service of the Ba'athist regime.","Our collective memories are welcoming places, and one image, that of Jesus, has absorbed and appropriated elements of other traditions and aspirations in order to shape our communal remembering.","There is not much we can say with absolute confidence about the early church, but we can be fairly sure that the first Christians would not have dreamed of making a likeness of Jesus.","Objects let you tell a narrative that encompasses everybody. Texts don't.","Because of the long, long history of British shipping, immigration, trade, empire, missionaries, you can have a better shot at telling a worldwide story in the British Museum's collection than any other. Britain has been more connected with the rest of the world than any other country, for longer.","There's the constant concern with what happens to you when you die. Every society thinks about that and makes things to deal with that.","In 1600, when Shakespeare's audience at the Globe heard 'Hamlet' for the first time, every one of them knew very well what it meant to be handed a cup of wine by a figure of authority and told to drink.","The distinction between a gallery and a museum is enormous. The gallery is about looking at a thing of beauty; the purpose of the activity is an aesthetic response. The museum is actually about the object that lets you get into somebody else's life.","London theatre is different: it is a commercial theatre that brings the whole of society into one place. And Shakespeare grasped, better than anyone else, what it means to engage the entire audience.","If you are born in 1564, your dislocation from your parents' experience is very profound. You are the first generation who will have had all your religious experience in English, the first to have a countryman circumnavigate the globe. All the power and economic structures of the world are changing around you.","I feel I understand now why, whenever there are revolutions, Shakespeare is what people turn to. Because whenever a society is on the cusp, about to become something else, they find themselves in Shakespeare.","The focus in the Western pictorial tradition is on the body of Christ, the bit you can paint, the Nativity and the infancy, but above all the Passion, where you can find images for every stage and every moment."],"Neil Marshall":["Pretty much every society, every culture in the world has some version of the Arthur legend, so everybody knows it; certainly in the western world, everybody knows King Arthur, but nobody knows what happens next.","I would love to do a Black Widow movie. That's perfect, I would love to do that. That character is really interesting: she doesn't have any superpowers; she just has extraordinary skills, and the world that she comes from, being this ex-K.G.B. assassin, I find that really fascinating, yeah.","Roman history was kind of unavoidable where I was growing up. It was everywhere - all the place names and ruins and forts. My dad's a history buff, and I spent a lot of time on Hadrian's Wall. I became fascinated by the idea of what was so terrifying up there that the Romans built a 60-mile long, 30ft high stone wall to keep it out?","My belief is that if you start a film all the way up at level 10, you've got nowhere to go.","I enjoy scaring people too much to let it go!","I do enjoy intense, bloodthirsty action, but I like to blend and cross genres. I don't want to be too predictable.","My dad's a history buff, and I spent a lot of time on Hadrian's Wall. I became fascinated by the idea of what was so terrifying up there that the Romans built a 60-mile long, 30-ft-high stone wall to keep it out.","I got plenty of grief for 'Blackwater,' because in the books, there's this huge chain across the harbor that features prominently in the battle. And we simply weren't able to do it with our budget and do it any justice, so we had to lose it.","The guys on 'Game of Thrones' trust me implicitly to take care of the action stuff. I don't mess with their drama, but they allow me to come up with ideas like 'Hey, what if the giant had a bow? And what if he shot some guy off the wall?' With 'Constantine,' too, they really trust me to scare the audience.","One episode of 'Game of Thrones' is equivalent to my film 'Centurion' in budget and scope. 'Centurion' has a longer running time, but that's kind of the only difference, and I think people now, if they want drama, they watch TV.","I think I'd like to do a big movie with a strong female lead, whether or not she would be a superhero. I'm more interested in characters like Scarlett Johansson in 'Lucy.' I'm less interested in people with superpowers because I can't identify with them.","I see myself more as an action director. All right, I do enjoy intense, bloodthirsty action but I like to blend and cross genres. I don't want to be too predictable.","So much of 'Doomsday' is taken from the early 'Mad Max' films.","I set out to do a horror film with 'Dog Soldiers,' and what I came out with at the end of the day was something that was more of a cult movie, more of a black comedy with some horror elements in it. It kind of went over the top.","There's a real kind of snobbery in the U.K. about horror films.","I don't think they're gratuitous with the nudity on 'Game of Thrones.' It's very much part of the world. There's a lot of it, but that's the world they come from. It never is there to distract from the scene or the actors or story.","I was a film editor for eight years before I made my first feature, 'Dog Soldiers.' I am from Newcastle upon Tyne, in the northeast of England.","I always wanted to be a filmmaker and became one through sheer single-mindedness. I came to filmmaking from a background in graphic design. I went to film school at Newcastle Polytechnic.","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' made me want to make films. I am wild about the films of John Carpenter, Ridley Scott, Howard Hawks and Sam Peckinpah.","I don't really have a life outside of movies. But I like to climb mountains and walk the dogs. I like fine wines and good restaurants.","The score I always have on heavy repeat is 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark!'","With the exception of 'Descent,' that was a very conscious thing to make an action or horror movie that was an all-female cast because I hadn't seen anything like that before.","Shooting against greenscreen... my choice of filming is, like, I'd rather shoot on location than shoot on a set, and I'd rather shoot on a set than shoot against greenscreen. You start stripping away the layers of reality, and it becomes a lot less fun to actually film.","I love CG - it's a great tool. I just don't think you should use it to replace reality; you should use it to augment and enhance. Do matte paintings, do composites, do replications, stuff like that, but you're taking something real and working with that as opposed to trying to fake it from scratch. The human brain can tell the difference.","I thought 'Dead Man's Shoes' was a masterpiece.","I'm quite interested in adapting some of James Herbert's early work. 'The Dark'... But I was always desperate to do an adaptation of 'War of the Worlds' until the Beard stole it from underneath my feet."],"Neil Meron":["The Oscars is a sport. There's the excitement of watching something live, as it happens.","It's a very tough job to host a show and a very tough job to produce a show, and you're in a no-win position."],"Neil Morrissey":["Weekends are about replenishment and rejuvenation. Time in Wales would definitely be part of my ideal weekend, at my own hotel, set in 72 acres of absolute gorgeousness. I can already feel the air working its magic, with the sea breeze drifting over us.","I feel secure in my life, and I'm happy with where I'm at. I realise in some ways how enchanted my life's been. I could have ended up on a bench outside Stoke station begging for money. I was one of the lucky ones.","I love cooking and eating - I'm a total foodie. It started off as a survival thing as a student, when cheese and potato pie was all I could afford to make. My most successful results come from concocting something with leftovers. Any chef will tell you that you should taste as you cook, so I might make it a bit more spicy, yogurty or eggy.","I can't bear not to be liked, and I've always been a people pleaser.","I lived all my life thinking the reason I was in care was because I was naughty. Because I was breaking and entering, pickpocketing, vandalism. I wasn't party to any social workers' reports.","If I know I am going out in the evening, I'll save my shower till I am about to get ready, so I'm pristine. I'm not one for moisturisers and toners; the furthest I go is shampoo and conditioner and a bit of hair gel.","I pay attention to my nails. I have had this particular German nail kit for years, and I take it everywhere. If I don't trim and file my nails, they turn into talons. I cook a lot, too, and I don't like to see bits of food stuck under them.","I don't even like sitting in a taxi or on the tube when I've got a nicely ironed shirt on - I can feel the creases starting. I was taught to iron in the children's home I lived in - along with mopping, sweeping, and washing up. If you iron a shirt in order - collar, cuffs, yoke, sleeves and then body - it comes out all neat and gorgeous.","I have never been a major fashionista, but I love a suit, and I did have one made for me by the tailor Stephen Williams. The great thing about a bespoke suit is that it covers up my pot belly. When I buy a suit, I'll pick shoes, belt, tie, shirt and socks, and that will be what I always wear with it.","I've always wanted bigger shoulders.","I would like to dive in Vietnam and Cambodia.","I was a kitchen porter for an hour at the Bank of England when I was 18. In the cafe, someone clicked their fingers and shouted, 'Boy, come and clear my table.' I walked out.","When I look back over my career, I just feel pleased that I'm still working and getting some good roles. It's been 30 years now, and a generation has grown up with me. There are kids who don't have a clue who I am, but they queue up and ask for my autograph and admit their mums love me! It's all good - I am having a ball.","My dad died 11 years ago, I don't see much of my brothers, and I rarely speak to my mum. I don't hold a grudge, but being separated in those early years clearly had an impact. Our relationship didn't develop as it ought to.","There are loads of kids out there who haven't got a clue what 'Men Behaving Badly' was; it was such a long time ago. So I'm able to spread my wings a little bit more. I was able to do it on stage over the years. Most directors and producers don't know who I am these days, anyway!","I don't sit around and get depressed about things. It's not my character.","I know it's fashionable to blame your childhood for everything nowadays - thank you, Freud. The thing is, though, I really don't feel scarred by mine. But perhaps if I'd been in therapy for 10 years, and you were able to read the records, you'd disagree.","There's a lot of stigma attached to being in a home. Other parents don't want their kids to play with you because you're naughty or nasty.","I do know people who buy these huge houses but I always think, 'What about all that furniture? You're never even going to sit on it!' I don't want to rattle round in a big house.","I think actors worry too much about age. They should just get out there and make sure they're up for whatever jobs come along.","Quite often, we're swamped with friends. My house is known as Hotel Morrissey, which is quite handy whenever I need dog-sitters for Tiggy. She's my tiny little rescue dog, the size of both of my feet put together.","We get the papers: I prefer broadsheets because I had the fear of God put into me by the tabloids and, though I'm very much over it, I still don't really like to read them. It's a destructive vernacular that makes me angry and scared, and it is all sensationalist onomatopoeia and alliteration.","I went to a Turkish hairdresser, and they burned the hair off my ears with a lit taper. They just put the burning candle near your ears and you hear the hair being burned away. And the smell - urggh!"],"Neil Nitin Mukesh":["I think nothing's better than lots of water and a good night's sleep to rejuvenate yourself.","I believe if you become complacent about your work, it leads to a downfall.","No matter what happens, one should not stop dreaming... dreams do come true.","I don't believe in rebound relationships and happy sex. Everything has to happen with dignity.","Creativity has no boundaries.","I don't see myself doing slapstick movies or being a part of them, even if they get the box office ringing. It's not my space; I haven't reached that point.","Music is something that I've been passionate about. I play the piano and sing, but I always knew that it was never going to be my bread and butter. I was very interested in acting.","When a film doesn't do well, people start doubting you as an actor.","I am simple and an open book. I don't like ambitious and materialistic people.","I always put myself in the audience's place and see if, as a viewer, I would want to see the film. If yes, then I want to know who's directing it, what my character is, and if it's impactful. If all these points fall in place, I'll do the film. If not, then I won't think twice before saying no.","'Game of Thrones' is one of my favourite series.","My mom once told me that she wants to be born as my girlfriend in the next birth because she sees me how I am, I am extremely expressive, and she loves me for that.","My grandfather was an excellent harmonium player, and after him, I, too, trained myself and can play a few musical instruments well.","Social media lacks insight, common sense, and emotion. Understand that while it's easy to condemn celebrities on social media, people should also think of repercussions their insensitive remarks can make on the celebrities' family.","I love the way Indian weddings are hosted. We have kept everything traditional - except our engagement ceremony."],"Neil Patrick Harris":["Rather than ignore those who choose to publish their opinions without actually talking to me, I am happy to dispel any rumors or misconceptions and am quite proud to say that I am a very content gay man living my life to the fullest and feel most fortunate to be working with wonderful people in the business I love.","It's good to have a lot of once-in-a-lifetimes in your lifetime. If you get the chance to skydive, go skydiving. If you're offered a part in a weird Shakespeare play in San Diego, slap on some tights and rock out some iambic pentameter.","Being able to live my life transparently does empower me to feel like I can be myself more. It's easier for me to flirt with girls now that girls know that I'm gay. It almost makes it a sexier encounter than if I was trying to pretend that I was straight.","In my 20s, I mostly ate burritos and nachos, with the occasional burger.","I'm a very lucky man in this chapter of my professional life, 'cause I get to do jobs with wildly different skill sets.","Whenever I wasn't in school with a tutor three hours a day, I'd get a knock and be rushed to set and they'd be waiting and I'd film my thing and then I'd go back to school again.","I'm not trying to climb a ladder - I'm casting a bit of a net.","I collect puppet stuff. I have a puppet workshop in my garage. I was looking for any opportunity to be able to get very creatively involved in that world.","The voiceover thing is very selfless. You go in there and they've hired you for your voice, but they know exactly what they want, and the writer's there and he knows exactly how it's supposed to be said. So you can't really argue with them, you just have to let them tell you what to do and then do it.","I have a very large forehead. I have a pronounced skull. Maybe producers think that there is a lot going on up in there.","What defines a relationship is the work that's involved to maintain it, and it's constantly changing.","I have an unbelievable assistant who handles all of my scheduling! It's like a Tetris game.","I have more artistic control in a smaller show. But it doesn't really matter. Sometimes you can have the smallest role in the smallest production and still make a big impact.","I enjoy darker sardonic wit more than knock-knock jokes. I spent the first healthy chunk of my career playing all-American, pleasant, average, nice people, so it's fun to have some complications there.","I've been very fortunate to go from interesting chapter to interesting chapter.","I'm shocked at how early everything closes here. But people start earlier. I miss the late nightlife in NYC, but then again I sing and burn so much energy in the show that it's probably good - I get to go home and sleep.","If I wrote a musical it wouldn't be about me. Although I do some magic, so it would probably be about a magician who appeared and re-appeared all over the place.","I think when dance is mediocre, it's painful. But when dance is really impressive, it destroys.","Chef's choice is my favorite. I'm super adventurous.","You figure out what your standards are, and I think that's important.","Charlie Sheen is who again? Denise is engaged?","I felt a little green, because Shakespeare writes the thought process within the text; it was tricky not to think of what to say and then say it, and instead just deliver the lines.","I like the tube more than the NY subway though, you've got cushioned seats.","I loved Rent when I first heard it, but it grew on me and so did Tick, Tick... Boom. Some songs are more interesting than others and sometimes the ones that never stood out at first end up being the best to perform.","I'm a games and theory kind of guy. I love puzzles, so it was fun dissecting Shakespeare's prose.","I'm in a play on Broadway, I have an animated TV show coming up, I have a few movies that just came out.","I've been taking a trapeze class for the last couple of years. I'm working on my double back flip right now.","I've got no plans to be a ballet dancer at the moment.","It's nice to establish yourself as an actor first and a singer second. Proof is such a tremendous piece of work, and I'm incredibly lucky to be a part of it. I'm sure that the musicals will happen in the future, though.","My parents own a restaurant in Albuquerque.","So I've done my fair share of theater. I have also been very fortunate in that I've been able to come to New York two or three times a year just to see as many shows as possible. I think the live theater culture here is incredible.","Starship Troopers was great. It was great fun to work on something with blue screens and big budget special effects. Denise Richards was nice to look at too, of course.","Tobey's a mellow, cool guy. He's just a good guy. I know that's not the answer you want, and I don't mean that as the political thing to say, but he's a nice guy.","We're in such a volatile climate right now politically. I think they didn't want Assassins to not succeed due to popular opinion and politics, versus on its own merits. I can respect that.","When I auditioned for the show, I didn't realize it was an MTV production, which is going to make for really good tunes during the episodes, if nothing else.","I love Buster Keaton. I was a big fan of the stunt shows at Universal Studios. I'm a huge Cirque du Soleil nut.","Whether it's a double take or a spit take or an extra-long pause before a reaction or a line, I try to be as cognizant as possible about the technical end of it. So I think the physical stuff works easier for me than maybe for others who are more just going on instinct.","I don't know, on a sitcom, and in theatre especially, you have to really be listening to an audience. And if you're losing them, you can hear the sniffs, and the playbills shuffling and whatnot.","I always thought filet mignon was the steak to beat, but the fat content in a rib eye is fantastic.","I feel like I know where I'm going. And I like where I'm going.","The Tonys are the once-a-year shot for all of these shows and artists who work so diligently every single performance but only for a thousand or so people at a time. This gives them the opportunity to perform to millions of people.","When you call someone and ask them to do something they've never done before, in different mediums I think they would be inclined to pass because they're afraid of the risk. But the creative people who populate the theater world love the challenge of new things.","The theater is reaching as many different demographics as it can now.","I'm probably my biggest critic. I worry that if you spend any quality time reveling in good things then karma will slap you upside the head, so I try to stay as even keel as I'm able.","As an actor, you most often play relatively average parts, so to get to play extreme versions of anything, those are the most exciting parts.","I get to choose things that interest me as opposed to trying to get any job that will have me, which for a vast majority of actors is the case.","Jim Henson was the only piece of fan mail I ever wrote when I was a little kid.","I'm a nerdy, geeky fan of' Labyrinth' and 'Dark Crystal'.","I've gotten to hang out with Elmo, I'm the Fairy Shoeperson on 'Sesame Street'. So hopefully our kids will get to see and hear me as much as they're able.","I do a lot of books on tape for Beverly Cleary, and another 'Smurfs' shout-out for that demographic.","I remember thinking that the rest of my life would be solo. I wasn't weepy when I thought that - it was just a realization that I had gone this long being self-sufficient.","I enjoy being a hyphenate. I've always thought of my career as a plate spinner in the circus.","A cardio-funk class - I should have at least taken one of those. But it's always terrified me. I'm never one to be a dancer on the dance floor, even at a bar or a club.","There is just a lot of creativity and theatricality in performers who happen to be gay. Maybe there's a success in numbers, so by the law of averages we are going to get these jobs.","I'm not the best cruise ship crooner. I'm not the best karaoke guy.","The TV schedule is fantastic. It allows you to have a life. Theater actors are so disciplined - especially if you're doing musicals, you have to be in shape physically, mentally, and have to be on your game all the time. That's exhausting. On TV, especially a sitcom, you have a lot of free time to play.","I've done plenty of daredeviling - from white-water rafting to bungee jumping. But I think the most fearless was hosting the Emmy Awards. It was overwhelming, and I definitely had to leave fear at the door.","I don't know, but I think kids just want to be listened to, so I want to make sure I do that.","We're blessed on 'How I Met Your Mother' to feel like we're doing a bit of a funny playlet everyday.","I think it has been a weird mistake to have people with their own music careers going on and judging people because when they're too critical, it affects them. They don't want to be that honest, because they need to keep their appearance up.","I love the 'So You Think You Can Dance' show. I love it. I think it's some of the best hours on TV.","My favorite time to dance is at, like, wedding receptions, when it's all ages and everyone seems to be having fun.","I think things through a lot, so I probably use my head more than my heart. That probably comes through in my acting.","I need to stop carving out four-hour chunks to do random things and go home and watch my children grow up.","I didn't want to go marching down the street with camera crews. Oy. To get married? Really? It seems like you have an agenda when you do it that way. I wouldn't want to get married to be an example.","Mr. Steven Bochco is a very wise man. After a many-monthed nationwide search to find a precocious teenage doctor, he hired me.","What I enjoy so much about the Tonys' uniqueness is that anyone who's tuning in has an interest in seeing the show, so our job is halfway done.","We're trying to get as many people to become interested in seeing it, but if you like the theater and you're interested in seeing what live theater looks like in New York, you probably already set your DVR. It's gonna be a hard ask to get a bunch of college-basketball fans to tune in for three hours to watch the Tonys.","Thankfully, the meat of the Tony telecast is the performances from the shows, so the awards show kind of creates itself around the season, and then I fill in based on the vibe of the season in general. I'm happy that there'll be so many legitimately good performances on the show.","I was a big fan of how Johnny Carson hosted awards shows. Dick Cavett, as well, I think did a really great job of providing a nice blend of comedy, wit and class.","With the Tonys it's a little tricky because a lot of the funnier jokes are more insider, so people watching at home may not get a Julie Taymor reference the way that New Yorkers would. So you have to figure out what comedy plays to a large audience and still respect the individuals who are there.","I thought the idea of 'Smurfs' lent itself to the 3-D environment pretty well, I think, better than some of the farm animal movies that have been done before. I was a fan of the 'Smurfs' and they come with their own fan base, which I thought was nice.","I like to make decisions based on things I'm interested in doing, not what seems like the next move in my quote-unquote career.","There are so many examples of talented actors working today, no matter how they live their private lives. I'm lucky that people believe me when I'm in character.","I always thought I'd make a good parent, but I was single and led a solitary life for many, many years. Then I met David, and he had experience with kids and wanted to have a family, too.","I'm a big proponent of monogamous relationships regardless of sexuality, and I'm proud of how the nation is steering toward that.","I don't stay up and rent private jets and go on yachts and whoop it up in Miami.","Mmmmmmmm. Anderson. He's dreamy. Just dreamy. I've been a fan of his since season 1 of 'The Mole.' I just thought he was so cool when he talked in this cool, low, secret-agent voice.","'Smurfs' just seemed like a great way to represent a young father to be, guy in a marriage, work in conflict, and I was really interested in the technical CG side of things. I'd never done a movie that I thought would be so physical and yet so precise. So I was intrigued by all of that.","Before babies, I worked very hard to make sure I understood my surroundings and figured out where I fit in the world, whether it was at work or in a social situation.","I want to be able to infuse some youthful energy and comedy while appreciating the generations before.","I pride myself in being able to straddle demographics, and if that was said as Barney Stinson, it would mean a little different thing.","You just take things as they come.","If you don't have any ties to the music industry, you just love 'American Idol,' you can sit there and do exactly what you do in your living room, which is stare at them and judge them.","It's like, the more you commit, the happier the animators are; if you're at all iffy and concerned, then it doesn't free them up to do as much fun stuff, so you have to just go for it and, again, trust the people around you and not be seemingly guarded and numb. Throw caution to the wind a bit.","I'm lucky that people believe me when I'm in character."],"Neil Peart":["I've heard the stories. Like, Eric Clapton said he wanted to burn his guitar when he heard Jimi Hendrix play. I never understood that because, when I went and saw a great drummer or heard one, all I wanted to do was practice.","If you've got a problem, take it out on a drum.","The real test of a musician is live performance. It's one thing to spend a long time learning how to play well in the studio, but to do it in front of people is what keeps me coming back to touring.","Stamina is the force that drives the drumming; it's not really a sprint.","What is a master but a master student? And if that's true, then there's a responsibility on you to keep getting better and to explore avenues of your profession.","It astonished me in the early Nineties to suddenly have musicians admit that they had been inspired and influenced by us. That meant a lot at that time. But of course, being human, the... disrespect isn't even strong enough a word, is it? The opprobrium was painful. Being popular and hated is not satisfying.","Extroverts never understand introverts, and it was like that in school days. I read recently that all of us can be defined in adult life by the way others perceived us in high school.","I always thought if I could just put something in words perfectly enough, people would get the idea, and it would change things. That's a harmless conceit. With people, too, you constantly think, 'If I'm nice to people and treat them well, they'll appreciate it and behave better.' They won't, but it's still not a bad way to live.","To me, drum soloing is like doing a marathon and solving equations at the same time.","If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.","It's interesting. I've known quite a few good athletes that can't begin to play a beat on the drum set. Most team sport is about the smooth fluidity of hand-eye coordination and physical grace, where drumming is much more about splitting all those things up.","I try not to repeat myself in fills in all the Rush songs unless it is something simple or something I feel is my own characteristic thing.","I'm learning all the time. I'm evolving all the time as a human being. I'm getting better, I hope, in all of the important ways.","What I've learned over the years is that the craft of songwriting is trying to take the personal and make it universal - or in the case of telling a story, taking the universal and making it personal.","It's not the music you hear in your head that other people are going to hear. You have to be able to make it true enough to the image in your head, and that's where technique and technology come in, for sure, and knowledge. It's not true and will never be true that someone who knows nothing can sit in a basement and make great music.","Do yourself a favor. Don't ever say to me, 'Everything happens for a reason.'","Anytime I have an idea, I'll make sure that I put it down so that when we do sit down to write an album, I don't have to dream it all out of thin air. I don't have to be creative on the spur of the moment, or spontaneously artistic. I just take advantage of whenever creativity strikes.","Drumming completely eclipsed my life from age 13, when I started drum lessons. Everything disappeared. I'd done well in school up until that time. I was fairly adjusted socially up until that time. And I became completely monomania, obsessed all through my teens. Nothing else existed anymore.","To me, the highest expression of life is art with jokes. It's very rarified, very difficult to accomplish if you want to be more than just funny and more than just jokes about human gaseousness.","Racetracks are designed to make it as difficult as possible to get around that corner fast. And some ramps, by necessity, are that way, too.","Rudimental snare work is something I've always loved.","To get nostalgic about other people's music, or even about your own, makes a terrible statement about the condition of your life and your prospects for the future. I have no patience with that kind of attitude, whether it's on radio or among friends.","There's still a lot I'm angry about, a lot of human behaviour that's appalling and despicable, but you choose what you can fight against. I always thought if I could just put something in words perfectly enough, people would get the idea and it would change things.","When I was young, my ambitions were very modest. I thought, 'If only I could play at the battle of the bands at the Y, that would be the culmination of existence!' And then the roller rink, and you work your way up branch by branch.","Even as a kid, I never wanted to be famous; I wanted to be good.","Now I call myself a bleeding heart libertarian. Because I do believe in the principles of Libertarianism as an ideal - because I'm an idealist.","There is no blood in jazz drumming, and there are no bullies in jazz drumming.","I don't like lyrics that are just thrown together, that were obviously written as you went along, or the song was already written and the guy made up the lyrics in five minutes.","Playing a three-hour Rush show is like running a marathon while solving equations.","I'm still no good at ball-and-stick games. If I go play golf with the guys, it's intended to be a joke.","It was actually drumming that gave me the stamina to get into sports later. I started playing drums at 13, and when I got to the international touring level... I got interested in cross-country skiing, long-distance swimming, bicycling... things that require stamina, not finesse.","I had spindly little ankles, and growing up in Canada, I couldn't skate. I was no good at any sports so was very much a pariah through those adolescent years.","The Seven Cities of Gold always fascinated me. Southwestern U.S. history especially fascinates me. The whole spur of the Spanish exploration of the Southwestern U.S. was the search for these mythical Seven Cities of Gold.","Too much attention and hoopla doesn't agree with my temperament.","Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to play music that I liked, and even when I was in cover bands when I was a teenager we only played cover tunes that we liked. That was the simple morality that I grew up with.","If it's cross-country ski season, I'll be out doing that, or snowshoeing up in Quebec. In my California home, I go to the local Y and I like doing yoga. It's been hugely beneficial to me in injury avoidance.","Performing live in front of an audience is such a matter of will - all of those things you can do just fine in your basement, suddenly you have to do them in front of hundreds or thousands of people, and it becomes a different matter entirely.","I want to be an improviser, and I've worked very hard at that. It's an art. You don't just play whatever comes into your head; you have to be very deliberate about what you do.","People don't realize the limitations of 200 words, and the way they get chiselled down into a song that has to be sung.","I expect if you're a professional public speaker, you probably wouldn't want to go onstage and sing and play drums.","I believe in taxation and health care that is outside the usual libertarian mandate, because I don't want people to have to suffer. It's as simple as that.","For me, drum elements are like hieroglyphics - I think of a certain physical figure, and a little three-dimensional glyph will appear in my mind as I'm playing.","When Mr. Ludwig invented the bass-drum pedal, that's what made the drum set possible.","When I started playing, I played in R&B bands. I played James Brown, Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding and all that.","I think, in music, you're always hoping that you'll have a like-minded audience and that the music you like making will appeal to them, too.","Our songs were not written to be listened to in headphones or on the radio. They were written to be played. All of the little infinite detail that went into the arrangements and giving ourselves lots of breathing room in terms of playing what we wanted to play and using up any ideas that we had - all of those were conceived to be performed.","People say to me, 'Are you still excited when you go on tour?' Should I be excited about leaving my family? No, and no one should. It's as simple as that. If you put aside the fantasy of it, it is what it is and has to be done. And that's fine, and I pour my entire energy and enthusiasm into it, but of course, I'm of two minds about the whole idea.","Pure libertarianism believes that people will be generous and help each other. Well, they won't. I wish it were so, and I live that way. I help panhandlers, but other people are, 'Oh look at that - why doesn't he get a job?' While I believe in all that freedom, I also believe that no one should suffer needlessly.","In 2007, I studied with Peter Erskine because I was doing a Buddy Rich tribute concert, and I wanted to take my big-band drumming up a level. I went over to Peter's house with my sticks, feeling like a 13-year-old again.","For me to call myself a musician, it's necessary to play live, and it rewards so much - not just in the pay cheque sense but what it does for my playing. I feel it through a tour - I feel it at the end of a tour - all that I've gathered, and especially now that I am improvising so much.","For a person of my sensibility, you're only left with the Democratic party.","I sang the hymns, and I read the Bible stories, but I was always perplexed, like, 'Really? Jesus wants you for a sunbeam? For a what?'","If I go play golf with the guys, it's intended to be a joke.","I'd be very honored to be the ambassador to drum solos.","If drummers are 'anti-solo,' that's up to them. They're musicians, and they can play whatever they want. But my inspirations early on were people like Buddy Rich, seeing him on 'The Tonight Show', or Gene Krupa.","Live shows were always religion for us. We never played a show - whether it was in front of 15 people or 15,000 - where it wasn't everything we had that night.","If I have to travel, I'm going to travel my way and travel in the real world. And I'm going to have conversations every day with people in rest stops and people in gas stations and people in hotels and diners. That nourishes me.","I am the audience. I want to observe people. Even when I'm playing drums onstage, I'm watching people. I'm looking at them and their faces and their T-shirts and their signs. And travelling by motorcycle, especially, the world is just coming at me.","We don't want to be Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones. That type of thing wasn't what we were after. It was most important for each of us to be equal in input and output - each of us has to pull the same amount, musically, in composition and in every sense of being in the band.","It seems to me that's the only way you can have a truly creative aggregate of people is if they're all contributing in different ways.","The government's only functions are to protect the rights of the individual; therefore, you need a police force and an army.","The thing for me about Ayn Rand is that her philosophy is the only one applicable to the world today - in every sense. If you take her ideas, then take them farther in your own mind, you can find answers to pretty well everything on an individual basis.","Once, I went speeding past an old couple and smiled as I imagined their conversation: him grumbling about me and her telling him not to be such an old grouch. Then, suddenly I was in tears, thinking, 'I'll never get to be a grumpy old grandpa!'","The reality is that my style of drumming is largely an athletic undertaking, and it does not pain me to realize that, like all athletes, there comes a time to... take yourself out of the game.","You have to know when you're at the top of your particular mountain, I guess. Maybe not the summit, but as high as you can go."],"Neil Postman":["If students get a sound education in the history, social effects and psychological biases of technology, they may grow to be adults who use technology rather than be used by it.","Our priests and presidents, our surgeons and lawyers, our educators and newscasters need worry less about satisfying the demands of their discipline than the demands of good showmanship.","School has never really been about individualized learning, but about how to be socialized as a citizen and as a human being, so that we, we have important rules in school, always emphasizing the fact that one is part of a group.","I am not a Luddite. I am suspicious of technology. I am perfectly aware of its benefits, but I also try to pay attention to some of the negative effects.","The problem in the 19th century with information was that we lived in a culture of information scarcity, and so humanity addressed that problem beginning with photography and telegraphy and the - in the 1840s. We tried to solve the problem of overcoming the limitations of space, time, and form.","TV serves us most usefully when presenting junk-entertainment; it serves us most ill when it co-opts serious modes of discourse - news, politics, science, education, commerce, religion.","I don't think any of us can do much about the rapid growth of new technology. A new technology helps to fuel the economy, and any discussion of slowing its growth has to take account of economic consequences. However, it is possible for us to learn how to control our own uses of technology.","It is not entirely true that a TV producer or reporter has complete control over the contents of programs. The interests and inclinations of the audience have as much to do with the what is on television as do the ideas of the producer and reporter.","At its best, schooling can be about how to make a life, which is quite different from how to make a living.","'Cyberspace' is a metaphorical idea which is supposed to be the space where your consciousness is located when you're using computer technology on the Internet, for example, and I'm not entirely sure it's such a useful term, but I think that's what most people mean by it.","When two human beings get together, they're co-present, there is built into it a certain responsibility we have for each other, and when people are co-present in family relationships and other relationships, that responsibility is there. You can't just turn off a person. On the Internet, you can.","In Russia, writers with serious grievances are arrested, while in America they are merely featured on television talk shows, where all that is arrested is their development.","The idea of taking what people call the 'entertainment culture' as a focus of study, including historical perspective, is not a bad idea."],"Neil Sedaka":["I've always enjoyed seeing the world through the eyes of my grandchildren.","If you have a passion for something, never be discouraged by anyone.","I have inner peace; I have accomplished a great deal.","As far as I'm concerned, all politicians are fake people.","I'm not afraid of poking fun at myself.","America has a tendency to chip away at you if you've been a success for a long time, whereas in Europe, they put you on a pedestal.","I am very proud of being Jewish.","I like Manchester - I've played it many times. The people have a lot of chein, a lot of heart, and the audiences are very receptive.","I knew I had a remarkable voice, but I was embarrassed because it was so high. But when I sang at my bar mitzvah, the rabbi was in tears. He said to my parents, 'He must become a cantor in the synagogue,' but my mother said, 'No, he's going to be a concert pianist.'","I could have been bigger, but I wasn't controversial enough. I didn't do drugs or wreck rooms. There were no dramas in my private life.","I had talent, and I was hungry for fame, and you can't say I didn't get it.","I actually started as a concert pianist. I had a scholarship to the Julliard School of Music.","I have written for, very fortunately, some great singers from Frank Sinatra to Elvis Presley.","Between 1958 and 1963, I sold about 40 million records - to the shock of my mother and father because I was always playing Beethoven. But I bought my mother a mink stole. She was very happy, and she said, 'I think this is better than Beethoven.'","I didn't want to be a rock and roller. I wanted to be a Bobby Darin because he was the epitome of the performer, the sophisticated.","The Apollo Theatre was a difficult audience, and if they didn't like you, they would let you know. Luckily, they liked me.","You have to learn how to sing from your diaphragm, and you don't become a great performer overnight. It takes a while. The more you do it, the better you are.","My music is nostalgic. The early Neil Sedaka songs are always catchy and very singable.","There have been 700 or 800 songs I've written over the last 60 years, as I went through different periods of writing. I listen and marvel at how different they are and how they still stand up. They are very well done, if I must say so.","I think there are three kinds of songs; it's only my theory: psychological, emotional, and spiritual. When you write psychologically or intellectually, you have a tune in your mind, and you re-write it. It's an intellectual approach. The emotional is my favorite because it comes from my kishkas; it comes from my soul.","The spiritual writing of the song is where you're chosen as a vehicle, and it comes from something up above. You don't move; it writes itself. It's very spooky, but that's happened to me just a few times.","I like Maroon 5, Cold Play. Snow Patrol from Ireland is very good. Adele is wonderful. I enjoy a new singer named Rumer. I don't care for rap or hip-hop.","Howie Greenfield and I started writing music when I was 13 and he was 16. We lived in the same building.","Much of my music is inspired by what I heard at picnics and weddings and bar mitzvahs.","I think I was put on earth to sing and play music.","Music is so much a part of me: my parents told me that when I was an infant, I wouldn't eat unless the radio was playing music.","I started out just as Elvis was going into the army, Jerry Lee Lewis married his 14-year-old cousin, and Little Richard became a priest.","I tend to be on the quiet side. I think I would have been bigger if I had a big mouth.","Between 1963 and 1975, I worked very little. The Beatles had come to New York and changed music - all the solo singers were out of work.","I worked at Mar-a-Lago for Trump, for some parties, and he seemed nice enough - but I don't think he's presidential. I think he's incompetent; I disagree with his policies, and I'm nervous as an American.","I was from very poor people: 11 of us in a two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn. I wanted the large houses, the cars, jets, and yacht.","I have a Baldwin in my L.A. apartment, a Steinway in my New York apartment, and a Kawai plexiglass grand piano in storage for shows. I still play for two or three hours every day.","People seem to think of me as a goody-goody who never curses, but I can be very nasty if I'm pushed. Cross me too many times, and I'll never talk to you again.","The hymn 'Amazing Grace' is so inspirational - I wish I'd written it.","Andy Warhol was a good friend of mine. We used to go to the Studio 54 nightclub together with the likes of Liza Minnelli, and we'd dance through the night.","These are some of my awards - an Ivor Novello, a Variety Club Silver Heart, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame. I also have a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame and a street named after me in Brooklyn where I used to live.","I still play my old vinyl LPs - I like the scratches - and I miss browsing in record shops, because they held great nostalgia for me.","Tra-la-las and doo-be-do's became a Neil Sedaka trademark. I was the king of the tra-la-las and doo-be-do's in the '50s and '60s. But then when I re-recorded 'Breaking Up,' I started with a verse instead of the doo-be-do's!","My songs lie somewhere in between the evergreen standards, rock n' roll and pop.","I was a teenage idol, but not the one that the girls would put up on their walls, like Fabian and Frankie Avalon. I was more cerebral, like a Roy Orbison or a Buddy Holly. I was one of the few who could write songs.","I love kids. I think I'm a child at heart.","When the Beatles came to America and took me off the map, I thought I would return the favor, and I moved the family to England!","I take care of my voice. I don't go to loud discos where I have to shout; I don't have iced drinks.","I was driving my 1959 Chevy Impala down King's Highway in Brooklyn with the top down, and I heard 'Oh! Carol' on three stations at the same time while I was channel surfing. I knew then that I made it.","My teachers said, 'Always keep a Beethoven sonata under your fingers.' I always have. I still play chamber music, and I always play classical.","Being a New Yorker, I used to dance to Latin music. There was a place called the Palladium on Broadway. And Tito Puente and Tito Rodriguez used to play. So I still have that in my blood.","I did have my beginnings in doo-wop music; I had a group called the Tokens in Brooklyn. They went on, of course, to do 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' and a lot of other great things. I went on as a soloist. But I still love doo-wop music.","I rode on a plane a couple years ago with Snow Patrol and didn't know who the hell they were. They said they were big fans of mine and were playing Madison Square Garden. And they let me listen to one of their records on their iPod. I started to weep.","I remember Pavarotti telling me, 'Oh, Neil, after seventy, the voice is going to go.' But I've been lucky. You almost have to learn how to sing all over again. You use your diaphragm more. You have to choose the notes and pace yourself.","'Love Will Keep Us Together' was a combination of three different singing styles - Al Green, the Beach Boys, and Diana Ross. I loved all these people, and I put their singing styles together and wrote that tune.","I was one of the first American rock n' rollers in the '50s to go to many foreign countries. It's a wonderful thing to go out and spread joy and love rather than hate.","I admire Gaga. She's very talented and wise, that girl.","I used to think the whole world was Jewish.","I am a Jew, and I'm convinced that Israel is the homeland.","I love America, and parts of New Jersey remind me of Newfoundland - rolling hills and gardens - it's great! I guess that's why they call it the Garden State.","Family has always been very important to my life. Even though I make my living as an artist, my creativity is merely a fantasy world. Having a close family has been a stabilizing rock for me."],"Neil Sheehan":["Americans, particularly after World War II, tended to romanticize war because in World War II our cause was the cause of humanity, and our soldiers brought home glory and victory, and thank God that they did. But it led us to romanticize it to some extent.","We had a military and political leadership at that period which was genuinely deluded.","I never got away from the war. Not because I was obsessed with it in those years, but because it was the event of my generation and I started out covering it so I stayed with it.","We wanted to see this country win the war just as much as those advisors did. We felt we would help to do that by reporting the truth. And so there was the moral outrage over this general and the ambassador in Saigon who kept denying the truth we would see.","World War II had been such a tremendous success story for this country that the political and military leadership began to assume that they would prevail simply because of who they were. We were like the British at the turn of the 19th century.","I think you have to remember that Americans saw their purpose as so innately good that they could excuse the pain they would inflict on others to carry out those purposes. Because the purposes were so good, they would justify this pain we were inflicting on other people.","These men were wrongfully rejected, the veterans. The fighting man should never have been blamed for Vietnam.","I went to Vietnam; it was my first assignment as a reporter for the UPI, and I never could get away from the war.","We thought that whatever we wanted to do was right and good, simply because we were Americans, and we would succeed at it because we were Americans.","People talked to me in a way I think they would not have talked to somebody who hadn't shared the experience; they gave me their papers, they gave me their diaries. I found people constantly opening up to me. And I think they did because I had shared that experience with them.","The destruction of civilian hamlets, the killing and the wounding of civilians, became vastly greater than it had been before, and it was very upsetting; but I still couldn't bring myself to understand that the policy itself was wrong.","You remember all those phrases about how 'these people' - Asians - don't value human life like we do. Well if you spend any time around them, you discover that they love their children just as much as we love ours. That is certainly true of the Vietnamese.","The unthinkable occurred: two communist countries went to war with each other.","At least I'm at peace with myself. I have done my best to write a book about what really happened there and why it happened and it's done, it's published. I won't write another book on Vietnam.","Just because you put higher-octane gasoline in your car doesn't mean you can break the speed limit. The speed limit's still 65."],"Neil Simon":["If no one ever took risks, Michaelangelo would have painted the Sistine floor.","Take care of him. And make him feel important. And if you can do that, you'll have a happy and wonderful marriage. Like two out of every ten couples.","Everyone thinks they can write a play; you just write down what happened to you. But the art of it is drawing from all the moments of your life.","Sports is the only entertainment where, no matter how many times you go back, you never know the ending.","I love living. I have some problems with my life, but living is the best thing they've come up with so far.","Money brings some happiness. But after a certain point, it just brings more money.","New York is not Mecca. It just smells like it.","You must realize that honorary degrees are given generally to people whose SAT scores were too low to get them into schools the regular way. As a matter of fact, it was my SAT scores that led me into my present vocation in life, comedy.","Sudden money is going from zero to two hundred dollars a week. The rest doesn't count.","If you can go through life without experiencing pain you probably haven't been born yet.","Nathan Lane always wanted to play Oscar. When he came in the first day, he already knew his lines. He said he'd known them since he was 18.","Gee, what a terrific party. Later on we'll get some fluid and embalm each other."],"Neil Strauss":["When the Internet first came into public use, it was hailed as a liberation from conformity, a floating world ruled by passion, creativity, innovation and freedom of information. When it was hijacked first by advertising and then by commerce, it seemed like it had been fully co-opted and brought into line with human greed and ambition.","A pick-up artist gave me a good piece of advice: the three most important things in a relationship are honesty, trust and respect, and if you don't have those, you don't have love.","They say that love is blind, but it's trauma that's blind. Love sees what is.","A good organizer is key to anyone with a busy social life.","Fame won't make you feel any better about yourself.","Never ask a woman if you may kiss her. Instead, learn to read body language.","A lot of guys are very intimidated by an attractive woman, and they dehumanise her because our culture perceives beautiful women as commodities. But I think if you're able walk up to a person and get to know them, and you see their flaws and their impurities, and realise that they're like you, then you can humanise them again.","I've begun to look at the world through apocalypse eyes. Our society, which seems so sturdily built out of concrete and custom, is just a temporary resting place, a hotel our civilization checked into a couple hundred years ago and must one day check out of.","Because it's so easy to medicate our need for self-worth by pandering to win followers, 'likes' and view counts, social media have become the metier of choice for many people who might otherwise channel that energy into books, music or art - or even into their own Web ventures.","Anyone who hates something feels threatened by it. A guy who says he hates feminism (a) doesn't understand or know feminism, and (b) is scared of powerful women. Most attacks come from fear.","The trick, when you're flirting, is figuring how to keep a balance between being engaging enough to retain someone's attention and not seeming overly available. So you tease a person a little.","Your intention for a book is never the same as the reception.","I've seen rock stars agonize over the fact that another artist has far more Facebook 'likes' and Twitter followers than they do.","Since I was 18, I've been under orders from magazines and newspapers - chiefly The New York Times and Rolling Stone - to step into the lives of musicians, actors, and artists, and somehow find out who they really are underneath the mask they present to the public. But I didn't always succeed.","Many people we consider legends, such as Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry, remain so scarred by scandals, injustices and regrets from decades earlier that they're barely able to appreciate their accomplishments.","Almost everyone who reaches a plateau where he or she is happy and comfortable says it's because of finding balance between work, relaxation, exercise, socialising and family - plus some alone time to do something contemplative, creative, or educational.","You need to be careful with a Bluetooth headset. Because some guys look crazy with them.","To me, I think it's awesome to meet your heroes and find out who they are and where they came from and what made them choose to communicate in the form that connected with you.","I think there are just a million interviews in anthologies with famous musicians that are about the music, and they're really boring to read.","I always wanted to interview Michael Jackson, because I just wanted to humanize him.","Men are a hundred times worse than you can imagine. We are thinking the worst, shallowest thoughts, all the time.","The good thing is that women have such high expectations of men that it inspires us to live up to them. That's what I learned about male-female relationships.","Dating is for tools.","A lot of women - not all of them, a lot of them - feel insecure about men being men.","There can be people who are feminist, and people who hold the completely opposite view but are still feminists. It seems to me from the outside that there's a lot of people busy fighting each other rather than working toward their goals. It's a shame.","People don't come out for book events. They want to feel an emotion and be entertained.","I think my love is storytelling. No matter what it is, it's storytelling. And so whatever the medium is, what's right for the story, I enjoy doing it.","When I was in college, my whole goal was to write for the 'Village Voice,' and I think I was doing that by the time I was twenty-one or twenty, so everything else has kind of been gravy, you know?","I know that I need honesty from the people I interview. I also know that the truth is more interesting than made up stuff, and also, people don't connect with you if you're not honest.","I feel like rock stars feel a sense of entitlement, whereas I just feel a sense of good fortune.","Growing up, I was watched by my parents and strongly critiqued. Instead of saying they loved me or showing physical attention, they would joke that I had a Roman nose - that it was roamin' all over my face. Teasing was their way of showing love, but then you are young, sometimes you can't tell the difference.","While I am impulsive in many areas of my life, marriage is not one of them.","I've noticed a pattern in stars that start acting out in public. Every one of them felt like they grew up without love.","When I look down at my pale, skinny body, I wonder why any woman would want to sleep next to it, let alone embrace it.","When it comes to meeting and attracting women, many men are resigned and complacent. We figure some guys were born with that particular power and other guys weren't. I wasn't."],"Neil Tennant":["We've been working on a new album, which is going to come out next spring, which is very different, a change of style for us - it's going to be almost like rock music.","I didn't want to wear a checked shirt and grow a mustache - that's what you had to do, and everyone did.","Because some people have sex with people of the same sex, an entire culture has been created, broadly speaking, out of oppression. Which in a rational world would not be an issue.","We hope we are moving toward a world where sexual orientation is not an issue, because we hate the idea of a gay ghetto. I think that it's a real shame that people become restricted by their sexuality or define their whole lives by their sexuality.","I think the world should be one community.","They've pursued their own agendas, and they've done what they've wanted to do and not pursued traditional careers in the music industry. They've followed their own instincts, and they are in many ways maverick performers.","To a certain extent, this tour is a celebration of individuality and that you can invent and reinvent yourself. You should have the power to be able to do that. Sexuality is a part of that. It should release you. It doesn't have to be an issue. It shouldn't box you in.","We shouldn't feel restricted by our sexuality, and our sexuality doesn't have to be a cultural choice. That's an amazing variety of music within those five main performers.","Since we started, Chris and I had theatrical ambitions.","When we did concerts, we wanted them to be theatrical events - collaborations with designers, choreographers, and directors - because we thought traditional rock concerts were boring.","It was most exciting when people first came up on the stage and then when they came back for the encore. We wanted to make a show that kept on developing, that was interesting, so we tried to do that with our live shows.","We thought it would be great to see if you could put pop music back into musical theater.","At one time musical theater, particularly in the '40s and '50s, was a big source of pop songs. That's how musical theater started, really - it was just a way of linking several pop songs for the stage.","We decided we didn't want to do a musical for TV because the idea of writing a musical that would be seen on television once seems insane.","For a while we were chasing a book by Graham Greene to do Brighton Rock as a musical. We didn't get the rights, so we decided to create something from scratch, with Jonathan. By that time we were big fans of his work.","He comes to London and gets a job in a nightclub, a gay club, where he's known as Straight Dave by the bar staff - and no one believes he's as straight as he claims to be. He meets the daughter of the club manager, and he has an affair with her.","There's also a subplot about a guy who manages pop groups. Dave is a very ambitious boy, and he gets offered an audition but only wants to do it on his terms and conditions. He wants to maintain his integrity.","She's been a smack addict, she's had big success in Europe in the '70s, and she's lost everything. She's been rediscovered in the '80s, and as we meet her she's just about to sign a new recording contract.","She's a very charismatic character, and she holds the whole play together.","I'm always uneasy with messages. I think if there is a message, it's about taking control of your life. Not becoming a victim. Be true to yourself. In essence it's about love in the drug culture.","The first song is called 'London.' It's about two Russian soldiers who desert the Russian army and escape to London, where they indulge in a life of crime.","A lot of what used to be known as gay culture - broadly speaking, homoeroticism and being camp - has been brought into mainstream culture. I think we should be moving to an era where it's just sex.","I think there's an element where people get very comfortable in their ghetto. Which is fair enough.","When I was I younger I didn't want to be gay. Not because I was scared of the sexual thing; I didn't want to be a clone. Now this was in the late '70s.","I think we've come a long way since then. The big thing that changed was when ecstasy came along in Britain.","The big gay clubs like Heaven started having mixed nights in the late '80s."],"Neil Turok":["Quantum physics is one of the hardest things to understand intuitively, because essentially the whole point is that our classical picture is wrong.","It may be that we live in an endless universe, both in space and in time. And there've been Bangs in the past, and there will be Bangs in the future.","My goal is to get people thinking and trying to wrap their heads around the amazing things that have been achieved and to dream about what will be achieved.","Scientists cloister themselves away from the rest of society, happy just to receive their next grant. They lose their connection to a purpose.","If the universe sprung into existence and then expanded exponentially, you get gravitational waves traveling through space-time. These would fill the universe, a pattern of echoes of the inflation itself.","If you think about the actual problems we are facing - all the crises - we have the means to solve these crises. The past has shown us we are able to do things we never imagined we would be able to do.","My experience in science has always been that the future always exceeds what we believe is possible. I suspect that we will explore the universe.","The world is not made up of particles and waves and beams of light with a definite existence. Instead, the world works in a much more exploratory way. It is aware of all the possibilities at once and trying them out all the time. That is a hard thing to picture.","Quantum physics forms the foundation of chemistry, explaining how molecules are held together. It describes how real solids and materials behave and how electricity is conducted through them... It enabled the development of transistors, integrated circuits, lasers, LEDs, digital cameras and all the modern gadgetry that surrounds us.","You have no beginning of time. It's always been there.","My main interest is the problem of the singularity. If we can't understand what happened at the singularity we came out of, then we don't seem to have any understanding of the laws of particle physics. I'd be very happy just to understand the last singularity and leave the other ones to future generations.","I'd be perfectly happy with a mathematically precise description of how time began. I see science and religion as being two completely different things. I don't see science as relevant to the question of whether or not there's a God.","The only people who can fix Africa are talented young Africans. By unlocking and nurturing their creative potential, we can create a step change in Africa's future.","Some day we'll move into space and start ensuring the survival of our species beyond Earth, whether it happens in a hundred years or a thousand."],"Neil Young":["Earth is a flower and it's pollinating.","It's better to burn out, than to fade away.","As you go through life, you've got to see the valleys as well as the peaks.","Rock and roll is here to stay.","When you're young, you don't have any experience - you're charged up, but you're out of control. And if you're old and you're not charged up, then all you have is memories. But if you're charged and stimulated by what's going on around you, and you also have experience, you know what to appreciate and what to pass by.","One new feature or fresh take can change everything.","I'll never be Bob Dylan. He's the master.","It's cool to go places where working people are happy.","I don't think I'm a thorn in the industry, I'm just another part of it.","I don't look at a knife the way I used to. I'm more aware of what it is. I think twice. This is a key finger. It's in every chord.","I'm not into organized religion. I'm into believing in a higher source of creation, realizing we're all just part of nature.","I don't think that one day really relates to the next day in life.","I feel like I could be likened to an old hound circling on a rug for the last five years.","Of course you have to support the troops. They're just kids. They're doing for their country what's expected of them.","I just do what I do. I like to make music.","The '60s was one of the first times the power of music was used by a generation to bind them together.","Back then people closed their eyes and listened to music. Today there's a lot of images that go with the music. A lot of music is crap and it's all commercial and the images are all trying to sell the record.","Live music is better.","As I get older, I get smaller. I see other parts of the world I didn't see before. Other points of view. I see outside myself more.","We need to spread out now in the universe. I think in 100 years we'll be living on other planets.","I don't like to be labeled, to be anything. I've made the mistake before myself of labeling my music, but it's counter-productive.","When people start asking you to do the same thing over and over again, that's when you know you're way too close to something that you don't want to be near.","I was just 20 years old when I wrote Broken Arrow.","I'm not into this judgmental, religious-right kind of thing.","Some people put down all presidents. If you say anything good about any of them, they think you're supporting everything they do.","To protect our freedoms, it seems we're going to have to relinquish some of our freedoms for a short period of time.","I didn't really know what I was doing when I started. I just started writing songs. After two songs I just continued to explore it.","I totally have no other talent and I would be totally out of work if I did anything else.","My music isn't anything but me. It has jazz in it, and rock'n'roll, and it has an urgency to it.","There's an edge to real rock 'n' roll. It's all that matters.","Something comes along and you have to jump on and do it. You can't stop until it's done.","I have so many opinions about everything it just comes out during my music. It's a battle for me. I try not to be preachy. That's a real danger.","I can get away with saying a lot of ideas that are young and naive. I'm liberated.","I don't like the American media - particularly Fox.","I don't like war. I particularly don't like the celebration of war, which I think the administration is a little bit guilty of.","I don't think there is one president that's come down the line that hasn't done something good somewhere.","I go in and sing the song and arrange it and mix it and that's it. It's no different than playing in clubs.","I just wrote one song at a time. Kinda like an alcoholic. One day at a time.","I live for playing live. All my records are live, since After the Gold Rush, with the exception of Trans and the vocals on Landing on Water.","I think I'm going to be making country records for as long as I can see into the future. It's much more down-home and real.","I was a Reagan backer. It was a shock for some people that I could agree with anything that man would say.","It's a blue album, but it's not a blues album. I'm not pretending all of a sudden now I'm blues.","Studios are passe for me. I'd rather play in a garage, in a truck, or a rehearsal hall, a club, or a basement.","The cutthroat avenues of rock 'n' roll, I am fed up with. I don't want anything to do with it.","The rockets and the satellites, spaceships that we're creating now, we're pollinating the universe.","The thing about my music is, there really is no point.","This thing called Patriot Act, through which we abdicated a lot of our civil rights to defend the country against terrorism, it's a four-year story.","When the punk thing came along and I heard my friends saying, I hate these people with the pins in their ears. I said, Thank God, something got their attention.","With Crazy Horse, it's all one big, growing, smoldering sound, and I'm part of it. It's like gliding, or some sort of natural surfing.","Commitments are one of the worst things to have in the music business. They're very annoying.","All that stuff about heavy metal and hard rock, I don't subscribe to any of that. It's all just music. I mean, the heavy metal from the '70s sounds nothing like the stuff from the '80s, and that sounds nothing like the stuff from the '90s. Who's to say what is and isn't a certain type of music?"],"Neil deGrasse Tyson":["The Universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.","If your ego starts out, 'I am important, I am big, I am special,' you're in for some disappointments when you look around at what we've discovered about the universe. No, you're not big. No, you're not. You're small in time and in space. And you have this frail vessel called the human body that's limited on Earth.","Humans aren't as good as we should be in our capacity to empathize with feelings and thoughts of others, be they humans or other animals on Earth. So maybe part of our formal education should be training in empathy. Imagine how different the world would be if, in fact, that were 'reading, writing, arithmetic, empathy.'","No one is dumb who is curious. The people who don't ask questions remain clueless throughout their lives.","Passion is what gets you through the hardest times that might otherwise make strong men weak, or make you give up.","We are part of this universe; we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts, is that the universe is in us.","Once you have an innovation culture, even those who are not scientists or engineers - poets, actors, journalists - they, as communities, embrace the meaning of what it is to be scientifically literate. They embrace the concept of an innovation culture. They vote in ways that promote it. They don't fight science and they don't fight technology.","Everything we do, every thought we've ever had, is produced by the human brain. But exactly how it operates remains one of the biggest unsolved mysteries, and it seems the more we probe its secrets, the more surprises we find.","Rational thoughts never drive people's creativity the way emotions do.","Even with all our technology and the inventions that make modern life so much easier than it once was, it takes just one big natural disaster to wipe all that away and remind us that, here on Earth, we're still at the mercy of nature.","Ever since the Industrial Revolution, investments in science and technology have proved to be reliable engines of economic growth. If homegrown interest in those fields is not regenerated soon, the comfortable lifestyle to which Americans have become accustomed will draw to a rapid close.","The very nature of science is discoveries, and the best of those discoveries are the ones you don't expect.","There is no greater education than one that is self-driven.","Do you realize that if you fall into a black hole, you will see the entire future of the Universe unfold in front of you in a matter of moments and you will emerge into another space-time created by the singularity of the black hole you just fell into?","Those who see the cosmic perspective as a depressing outlook, they really need to reassess how they think about the world. Because when I look up in the universe, I know I'm small but I'm also big. I'm big because I'm connected to the universe, and the universe is connected to me.","We live on this speck called Earth - think about what you might do, today or tomorrow - and make the most of it.","Perhaps we've never been visited by aliens because they have looked upon Earth and decided there's no sign of intelligent life.","Space exploration is a force of nature unto itself that no other force in society can rival.","The most creative people are motivated by the grandest of problems that are presented before them.","Science literacy is the artery through which the solutions of tomorrow's problems flow.","I know of no time in human history where ignorance was better than knowledge.","I don't know anybody who said, 'I love that teacher, he or she gave a really good homework set,' or 'Boy, that was the best class I ever took because those exams were awesome.' That's not what people want to talk about. It's not what influences people in one profession or another.","Physics is the only profession in which prophecy is not only accurate but routine.","Dreams about the future are always filled with gadgets.","Everyone should have their mind blown once a day.","The problem is not scientifically illiterate kids; it is scientifically illiterate adults. Kids are born curious about the natural world. They are always turning over rocks, jumping with two feet into mud puddles and playing with the tablecloth and fine china.","Part of what it is to be scientifically-literate, it's not simply, 'Do you know what DNA is? Or what the Big Bang is?' That's an aspect of science literacy. The biggest part of it is do you know how to think about information that's presented in front of you.","What you need, above all else, is a love for your subject, whatever it is. You've got to be so deeply in love with your subject that when curve balls are thrown, when hurdles are put in place, you've got the energy to overcome them.","Typically, when you look for role models, you want someone who has your interests and came from the same background. Well, look how restricting that is. What people should do is take role models a la carte. If there's someone whose character you appreciated, you respect that trait.","There is no science in this world like physics. Nothing comes close to the precision with which physics enables you to understand the world around you. It's the laws of physics that allow us to say exactly what time the sun is going to rise. What time the eclipse is going to begin. What time the eclipse is going to end.","Kids should be allowed to break stuff more often. That's a consequence of exploration. Exploration is what you do when you don't know what you're doing. That's what scientists do every day.","I've spent quality time in the aerospace community, with my service on two presidential commissions, but at heart, I'm an academic. Being an academic means I don't wield power over person, place or thing. I don't command armies; I don't lead labor unions. All I have is the power of thought.","Most of what Einstein said and did has no direct impact on what anybody reads in the Bible. Special relativity, his work in quantum mechanics, nobody even knows or cares. Where Einstein really affects the Bible is the fact that general relativity is the organizing principle for the Big Bang.","'Boldly going where hundreds have gone before' does not make headlines.","I want people to see that the cosmic perspective is simultaneously honest about the universe we live in and uplifting, when we realize how far we have come and how wonderful is this world of ours.","Innovations in science and technology are the engines of the 21st-century economy; if you care about the wealth and health of your nation tomorrow, then you'd better rethink how you allocate taxes to fund science. The federal budget needs to recognize this.","You can't have people making decisions about the future of the world who are scientifically illiterate. That's a recipe for disaster. And I don't mean just whether a politician is scientifically literate, but people who vote politicians into office.","If a scientist is not befuddled by what they're looking at, then they're not a research scientist.","As a citizen, as a public scientist, I can tell you that Einstein essentially overturned a so strongly established paradigm of science, whereas Darwin didn't really overturn a science paradigm.","Let's say intelligence is your ability to compose poetry, symphonies, do art, math and science. Chimps can't do any of that, yet we share 99 percent DNA. Everything that we are, that distinguishes us from chimps, emerges from that one-percent difference.","If you slid Pluto to where Earth is right now, heat from the sun would evaporate that ice, and it would grow a tail. Now that's no kind of behavior for a planet.","You have not fully expressed your power as a voter until you have scientific literacy in topics that matter for future political issues.","It may be that our cosmic curiosity... is a genetically-encoded force that we illuminate when we look up and wonder.","Kids should be allowed to break stuff more often. That's a consequence of exploration. Exploration is what you do when you don't know what you're doing.","Kids are born curious about the world. What adults primarily do in the presence of kids is unwittingly thwart the curiosity of children.","The theory of evolution, like the theory of gravity, is a scientific fact.","Asteroids have us in our sight. The dinosaurs didn't have a space program, so they're not here to talk about this problem. We are, and we have the power to do something about it. I don't want to be the embarrassment of the galaxy, to have had the power to deflect an asteroid, and then not, and end up going extinct.","Carl Sagan spoke fluently between biology and geology and astrophysics and physics. If you move fluently across those boundaries, you realize that science is everywhere; science is not something you can step around or sweep under the rug.","I don't want people to say, 'Something is true because Tyson says it is true.' That's not critical thinking.","Any time scientists disagree, it's because we have insufficient data. Then we can agree on what kind of data to get; we get the data; and the data solves the problem. Either I'm right, or you're right, or we're both wrong. And we move on. That kind of conflict resolution does not exist in politics or religion.","To make any future that we dreamt up real requires creative scientists, engineers, and technologists to make it happen. If people are not within your midst who dream about tomorrow - with the capacity to bring tomorrow into the present - then the country might as well just recede back into the cave because that's where we're headed.","Not enough people in this world, I think, carry a cosmic perspective with them. It could be life-changing.","Mars once was wet and fertile. It's now bone dry. Something bad happened on Mars. I want to know what happened on Mars so that we may prevent it from happening here on Earth.","Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is one of 50 or 100 billion other galaxies in the universe. And with every step, every window that modern astrophysics has opened to our mind, the person who wants to feel like they're the center of everything ends up shrinking.","Space only becomes ordinary when the frontier is no longer being breached.","We think scientific literacy flows out of how many science facts can you recite rather than how was your brain wired for thinking. And it's the brain wiring that I'm more interested in rather than the facts that come out of the curriculum or the lesson plan that's been proposed.","There is always a place I can take someone's curiosity and land where they end up enlightened when we're done. That's my challenge as an educator. No one is dumb who is curious. The people who don't ask questions remain clueless throughout their lives.","Let me tell you something about full moons: kids don't care about full moons. They'll play in a full moon, no worries at all. They only get scared of magic or werewolves from stupid adults and their stupid adult stories.","Pluto's orbit is so elongated that it crosses the orbit of another planet. Now that's... you've got no business doing that if you want to call yourself a planet. Come on, now! There's something especially transgressive about that.","If you think of feelings you have when you are awed by something - for example, knowing that elements in your body trace to exploded stars - I call that a spiritual reaction, speaking of awe and majesty, where words fail you.","The partisanship surrounding space exploration and the retrenching of U.S. space policy are part of a more general trend: the decline of science in the United States. As its interest in science wanes, the country loses ground to the rest of the industrialized world in every measure of technological proficiency.","It's the great tragedy - people employed in ways that don't fully tap everything they do best in life.","What are we promoting in society? Well-behaved automatons that spew back what they learned in a book. That's not science. You can get a parrot to do that.","When we see animals doing remarkable things, how do we know if we're simply seeing tricks or signs of real intelligence? Are talented animals just obeying commands, or do they have some kind of deeper understanding? One of the biggest challenges for animal researchers is to come up with tests that can distinguish between the two.","For me, the most fascinating interface is Twitter. I have odd cosmic thoughts every day and I realized I could hold them to myself or share them with people who might be interested.","The history of exploration has never been driven by exploration. But Columbus himself was a discoverer. So was Magellan. But the people who wrote checks were not. They had other motivations.","I was born the same week NASA was founded, so we're the same age and feel some of the same pains, joys, and frustrations.","One of the greatest features of science is that it doesn't matter where you were born, and it doesn't matter what the belief systems of your parents might have been: If you perform the same experiment that someone else did, at a different time and place, you'll get the same result.","I'm on a crusade to get movie directors to get their science right because, more often than they believe, the science is more extraordinary than anything they can invent.","Space enthusiasts are the most susceptible demographic to delusion that I have ever seen.","I have a personal philosophy in life: If somebody else can do something that I'm doing, they should do it. And what I want to do is find things that would represent a unique contribution to the world - the contribution that only I, and my portfolio of talents, can make happen. Those are my priorities in life.","The only way you can invent tomorrow is if you break out of the enclosure that the school system has provided for you by the exams written by people who are trained in another generation.","I don't care what town you're born in, what city, what country. If you're a child, you are curious about your environment. You're overturning rocks. You're plucking leaves off of trees and petals off of flowers, looking inside, and you're doing things that create disorder in the lives of the adults around you.","I said that if an alien came to visit, I'd be embarrassed to tell them that we fight wars to pull fossil fuels out of the ground to run our transportation. They'd be like, 'What?'","Science is basically an inoculation against charlatans.","The universe is hilarious! Like, Venus is 900 degrees. I could tell you it melts lead. But that's not as fun as saying, 'You can cook a pizza on the windowsill in nine seconds.' And next time my fans eat pizza, they're thinking of Venus!","In science, if you don't do it, somebody else will. Whereas in art, if Beethoven didn't compose the 'Ninth Symphony,' no one else before or after is going to compose the 'Ninth Symphony' that he composed; no one else is going to paint 'Starry Night' by van Gogh.","If you want a nation to have space exploration ambitions, you've got to send humans."],"Neill Blomkamp":["A lot of parts of L.A. are interchangeable with suburbs in Joburg. Very big, ostentatious houses with palm trees and lawns. Lawns are very important. Never underestimate lawns.","I actually think Johannesburg represents the future. My version of what I think the world is going to become looks like Johannesburg.","I still really love the world and the universe and the mythology of 'Halo.' If I was given control, I would really like to do that film. But that's the problem. When something pre-exists, there's this idea of my own interpretation versus 150 other people involved with the film's interpretation of the same intellectual property.","Obviously I don't want to make a film that offends people, but the whole world is so politically correct - I'm not going to not do something because it may be politically incorrect. At some point, the metaphors and allegories break down. They disappear, and you just have science fiction.","A lot of America is kind of done. People have been making films about it for 100 years. Everything to me feels used up. But Jo-Burg feels unbelievably inspirational to me.","I think that, if there are topics that are just on people's minds, things manifest into reality out of the sort of global consciousness of being aware of those topics.","There are loads of sociopolitical, racial, class and future-planet situations that really interest me, but I'm not really interested in making a film about them in a film that feels like reality because people view that in a different way. I like using science fiction to talk about subjects through the veneer of science fiction.","I just want to make films that have enough of a budget to pull off high-level imagery but also have a budget that is low enough that I can do what I want.","High-level actors can be all about their close-ups and the size of their trailers. I'd heard these horror stories of how a really powerful actor can come in and change your script.","I think our problems are inherently unsolvable. We need to change our genetic make-up or create computers that will think us out of it. I don't think humans are able to deal with what we have.","On one hand, I think people are destined for something incredible if we don't wipe ourselves out, but I think we're going to wipe 90 percent of ourselves out.","What I do is spend too much time thinking. Most of the time I just walk around annoyed. Would I describe myself as relatively happy, I suppose, but society gets to me. And the people that have mastered life seem to not care, and then they die, and then the grenade goes off.","If there isn't a deep core reason for a film existing, what is the point? For me to be known as a filmmaker that makes films that have a point, I'm stoked.","The first film that I can remember seeing where, like, I just couldn't stop watching it - and it didn't necessarily make me want to be a director because I was so young, but it made me know that that's what I wanted to be doing - was 'Alien.' And I saw that when I was probably just over 10 years old.","I think naturally I'm a very visual kind of person. If I wasn't in filmmaking, I'd be in something related to visuals. And I used to actually work as a visual-effects artist.","In a lot of the really impoverished areas of Johannesburg you see these packets of cheesy puffs which are like 6 feet long and the width of a basketball, and they're transparent and they have like 10,000 cheesy puffs in them, and you can buy that for like 50 cents. It's kind of a weird treat that you'd see people having in the townships.","I just watch movies I like over and over. It seems to be a lot of sci-fi stuff. My favorites are probably - besides the first two 'Alien' films, I watch '2001', I watch 'Star Wars', the first ones, because those actually had a huge effect on me as well, 'Empire Strikes Back' especially.","If you don't have something that glues the audience to the screen, you're in trouble.","There is something fundamentally fascinating about the mechanics, I guess, of the human body and where consciousness and mind exist, and what you can do with the mechanics of the body while keeping those intact, and where those two cross over.","I never really think of something in terms of what not to do. It's always what's appealing or what's cool.","I think that in the realm of commercial, popcorn cinema, the amount of message or smuggling of ideas you can get in there is quite limited. Like, if you think you're going to make a difference or change anything, you're on pretty dangerous thin ice.","If I wanted to make something that actually made a difference roughly in this industry, I would make a documentary. That would be the closest I could come to actually try and make a difference.","I'm not particularly interested in working with movie stars. It depends on where you come from, I suppose. Why are you making films? The reason I want make films is because they convey ideas. I think some directors make films because they want to hang out with movie stars and be part of Hollywood. They want to be a star themselves.","I think the reason you use an actor is if they are right for the role. Most of the high-profile stars tend to be good actors. That's probably what led to their fame. So if they are right for the movie, you can certainly use them. But I don't want to, not at all. Stardom and Hollywood overpower the ideas and the film.","I don't want egos and personalities on the set that make it more difficult to make the film. I don't want people who take the focus away from the movie and the ideas behind the movie.","I like where we're going with technology and global integration, but the fact that corporations and dollars rule everything in our lives, I don't like it. This isn't the Hollywood I wanted to be part of.","When any young director gets hired by a studio to do a $125 million film based on a preexisting piece of intellectual property, they're climbing into the meat grinder. And what you're coming out with on the other side is a generic, heavily studio-controlled pile of garbage that ends up on the side of Burger King wrappers.","If something is as smart as you, do you treat it differently if it isn't a human?","The concept of even having fans is still kind of weird to me. I really just feel like a filmmaker that is only just finding my foot in and is beginning to participate in Hollywood and making films. So the idea of any kind of fandom or people that are waiting for something that I may release is very distant in my mind.","I want to make a film that is commercially successful because that means that the larger cinema-going audience around the world like the movie, which is my goal. That's my job, to make films that people respond to.","The only genre of movie that I could see making that doesn't have anything magical or otherworldly about it would be a war film. I'm very interested in history, and a war film could be something that would lure me in.","If you're not observing the world around you, in some sense you're not really an artist because then that means you're just replicating other people's stuff, or, I don't even know what you're doing.","I think growing up in South Africa, and then moving to Canada, I'm just genuinely interested in the difference between the First World and the Third World, immigration, and how the new, globalized world is beginning to operate. All of those things run through my mind a lot.","If you just compare South Africans to the rest of the world, I think that white South Africans, and especially English-speaking white South Africans, are exactly the same as Brits or Australians or New Zealanders or Canadians or Americans.","I think filmmakers in general are, as the tools become more and more advanced, you're able to tell stories in a way that I think is more realistic. The technology just wasn't there up until pretty recently, and it takes a bit of time for the normal artistic way of approaching something to become a mainstream thing.","Satire also allows you to make fun of every different aspect. It allows you to make fun of both sides. It allows you to make fun of everything, really, so you can do it in a harmless way.","There's no question that how Johannesburg operates is what made me interested in the idea of wealth discrepancy. 'Elysium' could be a metaphor for just Jo'burg, but it's also a metaphor for the Third World and the First World. And in science fiction, separation of wealth is a really interesting idea to mess with.","There has to be the popcorn genre element, or I don't engage the same way. I like action and vehicle design and guns and computer graphics as much as I like allegory. It's a constant balancing game. I want audiences to be on this rollercoaster that fits the Hollywood mould, but I also want them to absorb my observations.","I think that people who make films and think they're changing the world are sorely mistaken. If that really is your goal, there are far better ways to do it. I'm making politically observant films for audiences.","I think that 'Elysium' the movie is unrealistic, with the space station and everything. I think 'Elysium' the metaphor is completely realistic: it's exactly where we're going.","I don't put any pressure on myself in terms of what people or fans do or don't want. It really just doesn't occur to me. I honestly just want to make the films I want to see as a fan. The film will survive or fail in my mind by how much I like it. Having said that, everyone wants their films to do well and to be well-received.","I have zero strategy for my career - like, zero. I could get as much satisfaction about doing a $20,000 shot film the same way I could do a $100 million film with a bunch of effects.","'District 9', 'Elysium' and 'Chappie' were all born out of some visual concept first. 'Chappie' is the imagery, because I think I'm a visual person first, of this ridiculous robot character. It's much more comedy based and in an unusual setting.","The main stuff I like is from the late '60s to the early '90s. That's the stuff I love. It's the James Cameron's and the Paul Verhoven stuff. I guess when I was younger, 'Star Wars' had an influence.","I think there's a lot of crazy stuff on the Internet. You read stuff that is wild speculation, and there's an element of it that makes me not trust it because there's this undercurrent of insanity to it sometimes.","I'm a massive hater of 3D. I don't like it at all. For me, you go to a movie theatre and you want to be taken to a place and transported to a place and be in that environment, and I know 3D is meant to do that, but the effect for me is the reverse. I feel like I'm looking though muddy water, and I can't really see the image.","If you look at the most meaningful science fiction, it didn't come from watching other films. We seem to be in a place now where filmmakers make films based on other films because that's where the stimuli and influence comes from.","I grew up as an artist. Science fiction allows for design and creatures and guns and all the stuff that I like as well. So I think most of the films I make, I'm sure, will be in that category. But I can also see myself making a film like 'Black Hawk Down,' and I could also totally do horror.","'Chappie' would be like 'RoboCop,' but hilarious. If you mixed 'Robocop' with 'E.T.' and it was... funny, that's what it is.","I think the world of 'District 9' has a lot of race and oppression-based ideas that I would still like to explore in that world.","'District 9' was a singular anti-Apartheid metaphor, and 'Elysium' is a more general metaphor about immigration and how the First World and Third World meet. But the thing that I like the most about the metaphor is that it can be scaled to suit almost any scenario.","Johannesburg is weird, because half of it is like Los Angeles. It feels like just wealthy parts of L.A. But half of it is severe slummy, something like Rio De Janiero or something. So it's kind of weird, because it's both happening at the same time."],"Neko Case":["I think I've kind of been mistaken for somebody who's trying to be a spokesperson for animal rights, and the fact is I'm not qualified to be a spokesperson. I am passionate about it, but I'm not trying to make other people do what I do.","I would be a huge hypocrite if I didn't tell you that at one time in my life I thought the way that you made music was you got on a major label and you got famous.","I try not to be overly literal. When I'm writing songs, I write down a lot of words, and then I try to simplify it. I like to give people hints or words that make visual pictures for them.","I really wanted to find a piano for the farm house. There were so many free pianos on Craigslist, I thought, 'Let's get as many free pianos as we can and stick them all in the barn.' I got eight in a short period of time, only six of which were tunable, but it's still quite funny.","Everyone has to kind of fend for themselves.","Country music is completely punk-rock. It's the original punk-rock.","You can't just play the same thing, over and over again.","I tried to have more than one emotion on the record.","All I want to do is sing on other people's records.","I should have been an abortion. The only reason I wasn't was that my father was a Christian.","I want to get away from the social vampires in Tucson. The people who have no lives of their own and meet me and know who I am and feel entitled to say negative things. I have good friends here, especially in the bands. But a lot of it is just like high school.","I have this typical Ukrainian face. Even people who know my music don't recognize me most of the time, thank God.","I have a real dog-like mentality, in that it's like, 'Where is my next meal coming from? Am I ever gonna eat again? Will I ever write another song again? Will anyone show up for tour?' I think it comes from being really poor as a kid.","I just really dig feeling subservient to nature. It brings me a peace and calm. Kind of like a Faustian thing, I think.","I don't feel nervous or fearful when I'm on stage.","Everybody in my band is married, pretty much, and have lives at home, and I don't want them to be away from their families so long that they just start to feel psychotic. You have to go home and stand around in your bathrobe doing your dishes to feel like a normal person sometimes.","I know that I can sing really loud. It's like having that really big Evinrude engine on the back of your fishing boat. But I've been trying to be more dynamic with my voice, and not just singing on 10 all of the time out of terror.","I think my songwriting might be a little more on the darker side maybe.","There's just kind of a sweetness about Canadians. Americans are a little more pushy, I mean, in a way that I enjoy - they're basically pushy because of their enthusiasm - we're a lot clumsier than other people.","I grew up with lots of animals and I related more to them than I did to people. I feel a lot of empathy for them.","I just want to make stories. They don't have to have a moral or a reason. There might be some mild cautionary notes, but they're not moral. They don't impart any Judeo-Christian ethic of any kind.","The Bible tries to make humans not animals the whole time. I think it's a bit of a mistake.","I don't know anybody who doesn't hate being called alt.country. It just sounds like a website. I don't mind being called Americana, I don't mind being called country noir, or independent country is fine, but the words alt.country make me insane.","I didn't want to be the girl who posed in 'Playboy' and then - by the way - made some music.","If I could ever be on a Missy Elliott record, I could then die. Missy Elliott, Mary J. Blige - I love hearing them interviewed, I love the way they talk about their art. They're very self-assured, they're funny, they're inviting. I love it."],"Nell Carter":["I decided after my last divorce to marry myself.","I was a weirdo to want to be in show business. Most kids wanted to be teachers or nurses.","When I first found out I had diabetes I denied it.","Being diabetic was not what I thought of as being normal, and I feared the stigma of having to take medicine and having people stick me with a needle.","Rich is not better.","You have to put on more faces to pretend who you are.","Rich means you have to stay there to maintain it.","No matter what part of the business you want to be in, live performances are the most thrilling.","Most performers don't get a chance to sing in Los Angeles.","It's exciting to sing in the place where you pay your taxes.","I'm not very kind about marriage. I will never get married again.","I think music and laughter are the two things that can keep you alive. Someone who is really depressed, tell them a joke, and they may come out of it for even just a moment. Or play them something.","I wish that people could understand that people need to laugh. They need to sing. They need to create their own joie de vivre.","For me, you can put on something by Bach, and I'll feel better.","No one teaches you how to be graceful.","My marriage is very important to me.","Of all the unhappiness I went through, you must know I wouldn't live a moment of my life differently for what I have now. Would I do it all again? I wouldn't want to, but if it got me to the same place, yeah, I'd do it. Because I realize now that God would not give more than I could handle.","You can get by on four hours' sleep, but you're not very exciting.","I always look forward to getting back East. I miss the cold weather and the Jewish delis.","I had to want to lose weight myself.","I've managed to completely reeducate myself into making eating secondary. I used to eat all the time because the food was there. Now I feel like a kid in school who is gaining points for behaving. And I love myself for it.","I was never totally into marriage, and I wasn't a very good wife.","'Gimme a Break' ran for six years and gave me the kind of money and freedom that I'd dreamed would make me happy. It didn't.","I'm at my best when there's distance between me and a man.","If I'm with someone for too long, I begin feeling trapped.","I searched for answers to life's meaning and, though I was raised a Presbyterian, I converted to Judaism around 1983.","One bad review can destroy me. It hurts so bad.","I think when you're happy, emotions are right near the top - mine definitely are. I cry easily, I laugh easily, I lose my temper easily... and I beg for forgiveness easily.","I have my own definition of God, but I believe God is whatever you want Him to be.","There's nothing worse than working with an orchestra who looks down on working with a conductor who doesn't want to conduct for you. You need to be with an orchestra that can follow you and respect you.","All of us should do what we want and have to do. We can only limit ourselves.","I had a pretty rough life. I got caught up in the star syndrome. It's not something I'm proud of, but it's something that I'm glad is over.","I think that anyone who denies their heritage doesn't deserve their destiny. My grandmother was a maid. She put nine children - eight of them - through college; I did not finish college.","Whenever I work, I'm never really happy. I'm always second-guessing.","Because I've always had a strong personality, I've always thought I knew what was best.","Oh, I miss the excitement and immediacy of Broadway and the theaters.","New York is a good city for not having to get fat."],"Nell Freudenberger":["I'm not a big Woody Allen fan, but thought 'Husbands and Wives' was great.","I can't listen to music when I'm writing. I like music best in a car or on the train.","I like it when someone gives me a new book of poetry by a poet I haven't read.","I think that the practice of writing every day was what made me remember that writing doesn't have anything to do with publishing books. It can be totally separate and private - a comforting thought.","Alice Munro is a particular kind of short story writer in that she writes long, character-driven short stories.","I've always been a little bit more of a novel reader than a short story reader. I think the first books that made me want to be a writer were novels.","I think, in general, it's better not to respond to reviews of your work.","I think the few writers who influenced me most in writing short stories are Alice Munro and Grace Paley. They're very different, and I can't do what they do, but reading them gives me hope that I'll learn something from them.","Most good fiction also has a character the writer seems to know more deeply than anyone can actually be known in life, but a few unusual writers can make something great without that.","If somebody says your story is only published because you look nice in the photo, that maybe spurs you on to write.","Research for fiction is a funny thing: you go looking for one piece of information, and find something altogether different.","It's usually easier for me to begin writing in a character's voice if that person is different from me in some significant way."],"Nell Hudson":["I think, often, when you are in just a lot of pain, it comes out as anger.","I went on the 'Outlander' Facebook page - this is when I kind of first got a sense of what people thought about Laoghaire, because I went on the 'Outlander' Facebook page and found this picture of myself, and there were all these comments, and a lot of them were great."],"Nell Leyshon":["Writing a play, you have to retain it all in your head - you need more time. With prose, you can snatch an hour here, an hour there.","I think women often have problems with self-belief, which sounds a bit boring, but they do - and I think when women are bringing up children, it can be chronic, because you have all these other calls on your time."],"Nell Newman":["When coffee prices fall below production costs, farmers are often forced off their land, and they lose their homes, everything. With fair trade, farmers get a fair price for their harvest with a guaranteed minimum, so they can invest in their crops.","Have you ever read the back of the Newman's Diavolo pasta sauce? Dad on the front is dressed like the devil with a little beard and horns. He says that he sells his soul to the devil for the recipe. It was banned in the South. They thought it was an abomination.","To grow a tomato or a pepper and prepare a meal from your labor and care is primordially satisfying.","The biggest problem was convincing my father that organic food was worth eating. All he could think of was the nut loaf with yeast gravy that my mother made in the Seventies.","I used to tell people my father was a plumber, because that would mean we had a normal life.","I believe in the protection of the environment that supports us all.","By the time I grew up, acting just seemed like something I'd already done. I had absolutely no interest in it, even though some people thought it would be my calling.","Extinction was a difficult concept for a 10-year-old.","What I discovered was that just by eating normally, we all have background levels of contaminants.","I live in a cabin in Santa Cruz.","My background is in biology. Before getting into the family business, I worked at the Predatory Bird Research Group at the University of California at Santa Cruz, fundraising for them.","Adopting big-business practices is one thing, and adopting agribusiness practices that would dilute the meaning of 'organic' is another. On the whole, I think we're doing a pretty good job of preserving the integrity of organic foods.","When I come in from the beach at night, I'm too hungry to wait for anything that takes very long.","I want our company to leave a legacy of learning to find the balance between what's good and what's good for you.","I think all family businesses are difficult and fraught with problems because you have that family relationship to get over. But my dad has been so supportive, we've managed to work around that.","After getting recognized in public from my picture on our pretzel bag, I can understand not wanting to be in the public eye. It has given me a public persona I had always avoided as a child. I do it because it's for a good cause.","Basically, what we've done is, every year we take half the money and allow people who've helped us in the industry to give it away. One year, the ladies who put the pretzel bags in the boxes got to give it away.","It didn't occur to me to go into something that didn't have an ethical return for me.","It's become more readily apparent that we need to be growing our own food and growing more things organically.","Education is very important, and the botanical garden is the place to do that. I grew up in a semi-rural area and learned from that being my playground.","My dad hates doing PR, so I volunteered to do this for him.","I spent my whole life avoiding the public eye. At these food shows, I'm open quarry again.","I know I could make a difference by supporting the right causes.","Daddy was like a lot of people who kind of turn their noses up when you say the word 'organic.'","It's so gratifying to see people face to face who get to meet the people who are giving them a fair price for their work. They can now provide medical support for their kids, give them better education and in general have a better standard of living. God knows they deserve it.","I grew up shopping from farm stands. Dad taught me how to smell a good cantaloupe and thump a watermelon for ripeness.","I have great expectations for our company; pretzels were just the beginning.","My niche will be to support the environment through the growth of organic agriculture.","Barley malt has a really deep, rich taste. A lot of manufacturers have switched over to corn syrup over the years because it's a cheaper sweetener, but it doesn't have the flavor.","I always sought out organic produce because to me it always tasted better; the quality was better - if you got it fresh.","When I was at home, I always cooked, and I usually cook over all the holidays. I always used organic.","I did a couple of movies when I was little. You have to be possessed to be an actress, and I was not possessed... It was not my life's passion."],"Nell Scovell":["Together, we must all remember that one of the most effective responses to hate speech is more speech.","If necessity is the mother of invention, urgency is the uncle of change. Without it, progress slows and then stops and then reverses.","Studies do show that in hierarchical structures, you do get more harassment. There's more power concentrated at the top, which means there's more abuse of power concentrated at the top. And every TV show is very much a hierarchy.","By June 1990, I'd racked up 'written by' credits on both 'Newhart' and 'The Simpsons.'","The creative process is often wrapped up in bottomless anxiety, and when the world applauds the product of that process, it soothes the anxiety. Briefly. Then the anxiety returns and even intensifies.","My first joke that ever aired on 'Late Night' was for a list of 'Top 10 Least Popular Summer Camps.' My contribution - 'Camp Tick in beautiful Lyme, Connecticut' - squeaked in at No. 10. Like a trip to Camp Tick, my time at 'Late Night' faded into memory like a short session at a dicey summer camp.","My criticisms of late-night TV blew up some old friendships and sparked some new ones.","I was the second female writer ever hired at 'Late Night.' When I applied for the job in 1988, I had no way of knowing how much the odds were stacked against me.","I realize that 'hire qualified women!' is the sort of outraged demand that's often met with a sigh. No one disagrees, and yet gender inequality in high-paying positions extends into all professions.","An executive producer with an all-male writing staff once inadvertently revealed his deep, dark fear. While discussing a full-time position for me, he mused out loud, 'I wonder if having a woman in the room will change everything.' Of course, what he really meant was: 'I wonder if having a woman in the room will change me.'","Male writers don't want to be judged in the room. They want to be able to scarf an entire bag of potato chips while cracking fart jokes and making lewd comments without fear of feminine disapproval. But we're your co-workers, not your wives.","Arts are a luxury, proof that a civilization has risen above 'politics and war.'","The Kennedy Center Honors reflects our humanity and higher purpose. We are a great nation, in part, because we value culture.","Smash together the Grammys, Oscars, Emmys, and Tonys, and you get the Green Room at the Kennedy Center Honors.","Garry Shandling's stand-up specials were masterpieces of tightly crafted stories that delivered both hard jokes and hard truths. He was neurotic and self-deprecating, and his observations on life cut deep.","Early on in my career, I was often the only woman in the room, writing for shows like 'Late Night with David Letterman,' 'The Simpsons,' 'Newhart,' and 'Coach,' and sometimes I'd feel like I didn't belong.","Once, after a long week, I felt so insecure that I decided to make a list of people who thought I was funny even if I didn't think I was. At the top of the list, I wrote, 'Garry Shandling.' His early praise protected me like a comedy-writer version of Harry Potter's scar.","In her darkest hours, Diana, Princess of Wales, could have used a friend like Empress Elisabeth of Austria. The two lived similar lives, a century apart.","Hated 'The Imitation Game.' Totally inaccurate. A gay man with a messy room? Don't buy it.","Albert Brooks. Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Larry David. The best comedic actors play broad and real simultaneously, coming across as both larger than life and all too human.","Broad City's first season is full of moments that are insane... and yet make total sense.","One of the most rebellious things a woman can do is allow people to think she's mean.","Moms Mabley blazed a path for female stand-ups in a housecoat and floppy hat. Phyllis Diller worked equally hard to make herself unattractive to men and non-threatening to women.","In March 2010, I attended an art opening for Kimberly Brooks's show 'The Stylist Project' in Los Angeles. It was a starry celebration hosted by Dior and 'Vanity Fair' to benefit P.S. Arts. But even as fun-to-gape-at actresses like Christina Hendricks arrived, I couldn't take my eyes off the oil portraits.","It's notoriously difficult to get actors to go on record speaking about other actors. Such requests are usually met with terse replies from publicists explaining that their clients are on set and too busy to reply.","For me, TV had always been a medium for entertainment.","Jenny McCarthy has used her celebrity and sex appeal to attract attention to autism. And while no one questions McCarthy's determination and passion, many scientists have debunked her anti-vaccine message and her claims that a gluten-free diet can provide a cure.","Constant exercise can keep the body trim and taut, but the face is another thing.","I traveled to Israel in a small party assembled by Marty Peretz, the editor-in-chief of 'The New Republic.' Other guests included Senator Al Gore and his wife, Tipper. Like every tourist group, we climbed Masada, floated in the Dead Sea, and visited a kibbutz.","Given the long history of global anti-Semitism and continued calls for the destruction of Israel, it's tough to be a Jew.","The Pulitzer Prize was established when Joseph Pulitzer died in 1911, leaving a bequest to create the eponymous award. An immigrant from Hungary, Pulitzer struck it rich by combining the 'St. Louis Post' and the 'St. Louis Dispatch' to make the - wait for it - 'St. Louis Post-Dispatch.'","There have been many great newspapermen, but to my mind, only two have achieved immortality: Pulitzer for his endowment and William Randolph Hearst for his castle.","Retaining a child-like sense of wonder is a boon for creative types like Steven Spielberg and J. K. Rowling.","An ocean of ink - real and virtual - has been spilled critiquing the appearance of female politicians.","Feminists cried, 'Sexism!' when New York Senator Hillary Clinton was judged not by the content of her character but by the color of her pantsuits.","Howard Dean is no longer the brilliant mastermind of the Fifty State Strategy that enabled the Democrats to storm the White House and Congress. He's the idiot wearing an ugly sweatshirt.","The focus on male politicians extends beyond clothes, legs, and pretty faces. It's hard to find an article about former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich that doesn't mention his mop.","Like Lindsay Lohan and Lauren Conrad, Barack Obama is addicted to his BlackBerry.","In TV, you look to make characters consistent, but in real life, we're not consistent. Sometimes we're brave, and sometimes we're not. Sometimes we're very aggressive, and sometimes we back right down.","The first Emmys I went to was in 1990 when the five nominees for best comedy were 'Designing Women,' 'Golden Girls,' 'Murphy Brown,' 'Cheers,' 'Wonder Years.' Three and a half were created by women.","I basically lived like a guy for, certainly, the first decade of my career, and I just wanted to blend in.","When you start a memoir, you think, 'I'm going to blast all the people who were mean to me.' And then you start writing, and you go, actually, it's so much more fun to say nice things about people who were kind and generous to you.","The more successful you are as a man, the more you're liked. And the more successful you are as a woman, the more you're disliked.","We have so many great memoirs from women in front of the camera, from Tina Fey, Mindy Kaling, Amy Poehler, and Amy Schumer.","I'm a little sad that they actually came up with the metaphor of waves for feminism. By definition, a wave goes in, and it comes out. I would really like it to be a tsunami that creates a flood that forever changes the landscape.","You want a diverse writers' room, not because it's the fair thing to do or the right thing to do, but because it's the best thing to do for your show. I've seen that to be true.","People say, 'Dress for the job you want,' and since I wanted a job that guys had, I dressed like a guy.","I think empathy is undervalued in a lot of these comedy writers' rooms.","The average career span for a TV writer is 11 years. The only other thing I could find that had the same career span was a police dog.","In Hollywood, you kind of trick yourself into feeling like you have impact.","The vocabulary of my cynical world doesn't allow me to explain the success of 'Lean In.'","I think I'm funnier in my writing than in person.","If women who don't help women get a special circle in hell, I think women who do help women should get a special cloud in heaven.","Unfortunately, my system for tracking down funny female writers isn't methodical. It's mainly based on word-of-mouth, which can cast a limited net.","Moral licensing comes into play when people rely on past behavior to dismiss current prejudiced behavior. This is better known as the 'Some of my best friends are...' defense.","Everyone - male and female - is biased. But no one wants to admit it, so our brains search for examples that disprove the accusation.","I've been speaking out about harassment and gender disparity for years.","One of the great things about being in entertainment is you have access to the media. People pay attention to you.","I'm both an insider and an outsider.","I loved working on 'Murphy Brown,' and I loved working on 'Monk.'","There's this perception that there's a pipeline problem for women and people of color. I don't buy into that. I think we have a broken doorbell problem, and there are plenty of women and people of color standing at the doorstep trying to get in the door, and nobody's opening it.","For thirty years, I've been hearing that it's getting better for women. And until I see statistical proof over enough years that that's true, I won't believe it.","I was ahead of the gender curve, but I wasn't ahead of the intersectionality curve, and I get it now. It's important to me.","Writing for TV made way more sense than writing for magazines. And by sense, I mean money.","I have a husband who didn't just resign himself to staying home but was happy to be the primary parent.","I think, in all fields, there's this motherhood pay penalty where, the second you become a mother - and this is true whether you give birth or adopt - you're perceived to not be as committed to your job. Whereas men are perceived as breadwinners who now need more money and promotions because they're fathers.","You don't have to let a bad experience stop you from doing what you want to do.","Like leggings, comedies created by women came into vogue in the late 1980s, exploded in the early '90s, went mainstream in the mid-'90s, and were shoved into the back of the closet around 1997.","There have always been women who were successful against the odds. Now we need to change the odds so more women can be successful.","I fantasize about the networks making a rule that each show's writing staff needs to reflect the gender and racial makeup of its audience.","When I write, I feel like an optometrist, constantly flipping between lenses and asking, 'Is this better? Is this?' Slowly, the work comes into focus.","Hollywood is built on relationships, and the way you keep relationships is by playing nice.","The desire to keep doing what we love supersedes the desire to penalize bad behavior.","Blondness is a core Trump-family value: Both Donald Jr. and Eric got the memo and married blondes.","When blue-eyed Donald Trump married hazel-eyed Ivana Zelnickova, he probably figured his broad-shouldered DNA would dominate her girly alleles. But genetics played a cruel trick on Trump: Of the couple's three children, only the youngest, Eric, wound up with his father's fishy blue eyes.","Trump Tower is no ordinary property: It is the jewel in Donald Trump's brass crown.","In the writers' room, I know the difference when someone brushes up against me and makes a sexist crack and when they've stepped over the line and made me feel uncomfortable and unsafe.","I'm on the board of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which is run by Dr. Stacy Smith - she conceived of the inclusion rider. What I love about the inclusion rider is it uses the fact that Hollywood is based on hierarchies, and it knows that these key players have persuasive power.","I'd like to see David Letterman adopt the inclusion rider on his Netflix show.","When threatened, the nervous system sometimes goes into a 'freeze response.' You assess the risk and determine that fight or flight doesn't help you. Staying put does.","Sensitivity training is a fine idea but isn't taken seriously by those who need it most.","I've worked on over twenty TV staffs, and nine out of ten male colleagues are wonderful, inclusive, and professional. Still, there's usually one guy - the Tenth Man - who turns a fun job into a dental appointment.","Misogyny - and racism - are 'hidden in plain sight,' and the burden of eliminating them should fall on the institutions, not the victims.","In over thirty years working in TV and movies, I've never had an exit interview or contributed to a 360 assessment.","If I were to write a sequel to 'Lean In' for men, I would call it 'Make Room.'","Sometimes, not knowing what you're doing allows you to do things you never knew you could do.","Give me a rock, and I will roll it.","At 26, I was single, living in Manhattan, and working as a journalist at 'Vanity Fair.' I was Carrie Bradshaw... in sensible shoes.","Hollywood is hard on everyone, but it really is harder on women and people of color.","Making someone laugh is the simplest, most basic positive human connection.","Even when powerful men stumble, they inspire fear.","To be happy about the fall of one powerful man is to know there are another 10 that need to follow.","I turned 40, and things started to go south.","One of the greatest benefits to come out of 'Lean In' was convincing women to help and support other women - not out of this sense of duty and that you'd be condemned to hell forever if you didn't, but because it will make all your lives better.","Writing is not what you start. It's not even what you finish. It's what you start, finish, and put out there for the world to see.","I learned not to get too happy about good news or too distraught about bad.","I'm such an admirer of Wendy Davis.","I think it's an uphill battle in every field. You hear late-night comedy is hard on women. And then you hear investment banking is hard on women. And tech is hard on women. And then you start digging, and you learn philosophy departments are hard on women!"],"Nell Zink":["I was always a bit concerned about purity of essence. I never wanted a job that might affect the way I wrote or thought.","The first job I had with what you might call human dignity, meaning with an office of my own and a bit of self-determination, was in technical writing, and only after I moved to Tel Aviv, where being a native English speaker is a meal ticket.","My mother was very, very critical of my early efforts. She was, like, 'At your age, the Brontes were doing X, Y, and Z.'","I saw a cardinal when I was in Brooklyn, and I was almost moved to tears. I was, like, 'I can't believe this thing is legal. I can't believe this thing is in the wild. How did this happen? How has someone not killed them all? They're so conspicuous. They're gorgeous. How can they still be alive?'","Like beautiful homes, cute babies, or noble careers helping others, books can make us feel like we mean something positive, and in gratitude, we truly love them.","I tend to be slightly fastidious in the company I keep. As a woman, you almost need to be.","My whole life, I wanted to write. What validates you as a writer is the adulation of fans... and I've got that... 'Animal Review' is pretty well-known.","I admire Eudora Welty. 'Delta Wedding' is a book I've given as a present to numerous women. Eudora Welty rocks. She writes such jewel-like, fine, refined short stories.","If you're going to clutter up the world with more novels, you should do a little more than entertain people.","When people recommend to me a book for personal reasons, that's what makes it fun to read. It's like when people would make mixtapes and say, 'Here are the songs I think you should know.'"],"Nellie Bly":["It is only after one is in trouble that one realizes how little sympathy and kindness there are in the world.","How can a doctor judge a woman's sanity by merely bidding her good morning and refusing to hear her pleas for release? Even the sick ones know it is useless to say anything, for the answer will be that it is their imagination.","Could I pass a week in the insane ward at Blackwell's Island? I said I could and I would. And I did.","I took upon myself to enact the part of a poor, unfortunate crazy girl, and felt it my duty not to shirk any of the disagreeable results that should follow.","On the wagon sped, and I, as well as my comrades, gave a despairing farewell glance at freedom as we came in sight of the long stone buildings.","They were being driven to a prison, through no fault of their own, in all probability for life. In comparison, how much easier it would be to walk to the gallows than to this tomb of living horrors!","I always had a desire to know asylum life more thoroughly - a desire to be convinced that the most helpless of God's creatures, the insane, were cared for kindly and properly.","Even that was all consumed after two days, and the patients had to try to choke down fresh fish, just boiled in water, without salt, pepper or butter; mutton, beef, and potatoes without the faintest seasoning.","People in the world can never imagine the length of days to those in asylums. They seemed never ending, and we welcomed any event that might give us something to think about as well as talk of.","What a mysterious thing madness is. I have watched patients whose lips are forever sealed in a perpetual silence. They live, breathe, eat; the human form is there, but that something, which the body can live without, but which cannot exist without the body, was missing.","I always made a point of telling the doctors I was sane, and asking to be released, but the more I endeavored to assure them of my sanity, the more they doubted it.","I shuddered to think how completely the insane were in the power of their keepers, and how one could weep and plead for release, and all of no avail, if the keepers were so minded.","I have watched patients stand and gaze longingly toward the city they in all likelihood will never enter again. It means liberty and life; it seems so near, and yet heaven is not further from hell.","All the asylum clothing is made by the patients, but sewing does not employ one's mind. After several months' confinement the thoughts of the busy world grow faint, and all the poor prisoners can do is to sit and ponder over their hopeless fate.","I had never been near insane persons before in my life, and had not the faintest idea of what their actions were like.","I had looked forward so eagerly to leaving the horrible place, yet when my release came and I knew that God's sunlight was to be free for me again, there was a certain pain in leaving.","I hardly expected the grand jury to sustain me, after they saw everything different from what it had been while I was there. Yet they did, and their report to the court advises all the changes made that I had proposed.","In our short walks we passed the kitchen where food was prepared for the nurses and doctors. There we got glimpses of melons and grapes and all kinds of fruits, beautiful white bread and nice meats, and the hungry feeling would be increased tenfold.","I had, toward the last, been shut off from all visitors, and so when the lawyer, Peter A. Hendricks, came and told me that friends of mine were willing to take charge of me if I would rather be with them than in the asylum, I was only too glad to give my consent."],"Nellie McKay":["Music can make the cerebral accessible, the subconscious hummable. It communicates our shared needs and desires as sentient beings better than any other medium.","Toronto's a delightful city.","You know, if I can survive marching band, I can survive anything.","I'm glad if people can listen to some music and maybe fix some prejudices of their own, just by thinking.","In New York City, when they develop something, they never use the old buildings. It's so wasteful. Why not use what's there?","I think I have advanced ADD.","I thought I had a talent for alienating people, but I have no idea what it is that doesn't go over.","I have trouble with any kind of focus or concentrating, or getting anything done at all, really.","I'm not sure I know how to make music anymore. Maybe you're given a window into things for a time, and beyond that maybe it goes away. Why should you expect it to stay?","In high school, I was always into Jerry Lee Lewis, and they decided they needed a piano player for the jazz band. I had my little boogie-woogie thing that I did, so I did my little boogie-woogie thing. I had a very high-pitched voice.","In the hierarchy of instruments, if you're a harpist, you're considered someone with a brain much more than if you're a singer.","I don't listen to much rap, really. I can rarely listen to a whole record of it, because musically, it's very formulaic, and oftentimes it doesn't have the best hooks on every track.","Love is such a fleeting emotion. It's such a small part of the things you do in your life.","You can criticize something you strive for, and you can avoid something you dream about.","I tried to be just a singer of standards when I was starting out. And there was nothing special enough about my voice to make it that far. So I feel a bit like Rod Stewart. Once you've had that rock career, people will give you that chance where otherwise they might not.","I love writing for dancers. You don't have to worry about the lyrics. I think to write words without music must be so frustrating. It must be always be so good, so perfect.","I used to play in the subway. If everyone tossed in a quarter, at the end of the day it would add up. It shows you aren't invisible. And it's better than being ignored, or kicked in the head, or worse.","If we went back to the basics of vegetables, legumes, grains - the things closer to the Earth - it's a lot better for the Earth and for other people. We can feed more people, we can feed the starving people.","It's always so nerve-wracking being up there on stage. It's even harder playing in your hometown - and I have a couple of home towns - but, you're playing for all the people you knew in high school, so it causes no small degree of panic in my mind.","I'd love to give my music to someone who really likes to wow the crowd. I feel like half the time I just want to hide in the dressing room!","If you look through the century, certain things have gotten better and certain things have gotten worse. I wouldn't say overall that things have gotten better. I think you could say things have gotten worse, but I don't think you could say that things have gotten better. Overall. You can't say that.","I guess you deal with what you get.","There's a side of me that identifies with Aileen Wuornos.","I think there are nice things about every era. I wish we could just take the nice things.","You know, I wanted to get married, and so I - but I, you know, I realize no matter what you want, it's kind of a fantasy.","The other kids wanted to play Destiny's Child, but I wanted Anita O'Day.","I kind of go for the MGM version of every musical style.","I never know how to get off the phone, so I'm terribly admiring of people who can.","Public radio is the last oasis of free and independent music. For satellite radio channels, you have to subscribe; commercial stations are as corporate as basic cable.","Less money for public media means less access to the arts.","I'm pretty indiscriminating, and I have awful taste, generally.","I really don't care what people say. It's amazing that feminism continues to exist at all, considering how much counter-feminism is out there.","I will say that art may well be the only thing that lasts, so I guess it's worth trying."],"Nellie Melba":["The first rule in opera is the first rule in life: see to everything yourself.","Always sing below your potential.","Do everything yourself.","One of the drawbacks of fame is that one can never escape from it.","If I'd been a housemaid I'd have been the best in Australia - I couldn't help it. It's got to be perfection for me."],"Nelly Furtado":["Girls like to see girls dressed up like princesses occasionally.","Because of my Portuguese heritage, I have an interest in all of the instrumentation that comes from Portugal and Brazil as well.","I'm channelling my 14-year-old self. She's thinking about putting on her big hoop earrings and baggy pants and going to the mall downtown.","I remember really bonding with the first generation kids, the Chinese Canadian kids, and in high school bonding with the Latin kids and the East Indian kids. It was very interesting because it made me open to lots of musical sounds.","I say it's a girls' world.","I like my body so much more now since having my baby.","Having the balance of a work life and a family life has been so good for me.","It's just kind of empowering when you become a mother. You just get overwhelmed with this new confidence and you feel really in control of your life. It's been beautiful.","I'm privileged that I'm an artist.","Guys don't really care, they just want to get the clothes off.","If you wait this long to put an album out, you'd better be sure you tried your best.","Hip-hop was super-exotic to us in Canada.","I remember attaching a wire clothing hanger to the antenna of my radio in my bedroom, so I could get the frequency and get that station and listen to the top 10 every night.","I'm 27. I feel like I get it. I'm OK with being sexy if I feel like it. Some days I'm brainy, some days I'm funny, some days I'm sexy, and sometimes, I just want to dance."],"Nelly Sachs":["To me, a fairy tale seems to have become reality.","Bewitched is half of everything.","We breathed the air of freedom without knowing the language or any person."],"Nelly":["As you become a legend in the game, you build more doubters than you build supporters. And that's fine. I think that comes with anything that's challenging. I think it even comes with sports. The older that Michael Jordan got, I think the more doubted he became.","If we don't heal our own hood, who will?","I don't believe in luck. I believe everything happens for a reason.","I love speed. I love racing cars, whether it's on the streets or wherever. Don't tell the St. Louis police, though.","I probably only cried five or six times in my life and I think four of those times was from my daddy kicking my butt.","How many people out there really set a budget?","The fashion world has been great. We started Apple Bottoms about seven years ago; it's interesting to be able to create something from your perspective, for your fans and support. It's a little different for me, because about 70% of my fans are females.","I try not to name too many labels - not because it's not cool, but because it starts getting political.","I don't believe in luck.","So many people appreciate what you've done, the doors you've opened, but some people realise they're not going to be able to make as much money as they thought possible when you first started.","You think you had it bad when somebody put out a rumor on you in the school; think about somebody putting a rumor out about you on the Internet.","Rappers make what's in, in. If we want to bring back something like Jordache, we just say it and the girls start wearing it. We have a lot of pull.","I'm not a big crier.","I believe everything happens for a reason.","You always get that energy, you just want to be heard, to go out, do your thing and show people that we have just as much talent here as everywhere else.","You never know until a song comes out and becomes what it becomes, obviously you can't predict how the masses will react.","I won an MVP trophy with the St. Louis Amateur Baseball Association. I didn't even start. I was a sub on this team. This was, like, an All-Star game where we had athletes from different teams, different mixtures. We had, like, the only black team in the league, basically. We had four players go to the All-Star game.","Strength of 100 men? I'd probably just get mad and hurt somebody and end up in jail. I think invisibility would probably be the best thing. I could be like, 'You know what, let me just see what these folks are talking about over here.' Then you could sneak into Rams cheerleaders' locker room.","To get the Nickelodeon award? That's like 'it.' It's one of the best. It's definitely where you want to be in your career.","I think parenting these days is definitely different from when a lot of people grew up. As much blame as we give a lot of our kids for what they're not doing... I also try to give them as much credit for dealing with things that we didn't have to deal with. Bullying was one on one and face to face. Now it's all over the Internet.","I stand for the Midwest. That's why the album's titled 'M.O.,' 'cause I'm still holding it down like that. My friends and family all call me Mo, so it's kind of like really representing where I'm from and me at the same time.","My nickname used to be Moses - still is Moses - for a long time, and people just call me Mo for short.","I never was the battle rapper. That was never my thing. I always felt like it's enough room for everybody to do their thing. I like bringing new energy, re-inventing the wheel, so to speak, every time I come out.","I guess coming after 'Country Grammar' and everybody thinking, 'Well maybe, that was it.' To come back with something like 'Nellyville' and to have people accept it and appreciate it the way they did, that was a great move."],"Nelsan Ellis":["Being different gives the world color.","I can play a doctor, and I can play a thug.","Being different makes you beautiful.","When I moved to Chicago, I was coming from a school that didn't have any arts in Alabama. I essentially came from a town where the arts didn't exist and the desire for education didn't exist and wasn't valued.","Boot camp was the first time I got a heavy dose of discipline. It was the best thing that ever happened to me.","Domestic violence is an epidemic, and yet we don't address it. Until it happens to celebrities.","When you deal with Alan Ball, you're dealing with a person who is a genius in terms of how art imitates life.","When you're in a position that you can comfortably give, you need to pay it forward.","There are homophobic people in my family. They're deeply religious.","With 'True Blood,' you don't know what to expect. You don't know how wild it's gonna get.","I love working with Alexander Skarsgard. He brings such gravity to a scene.","But no one told me that when you're in the military, they own you.","I'd always dabbled in acting.","I was quiet. If I really wanted to say something, I would. I just wasn't interested in saying anything.","I think, in this country, anybody can do whatever they want to do as long as it's not hurting anybody else or violating the laws of society.","If you want to get married to a man, then get married to a man. If two women want to get married, they should get married. It's not hurting me.","The beautiful thing about this country is that I can be a Christian and feel free to do so. Or somebody cannot be a Christian and do whatever that entails. Or somebody can be a Christian and still be gay, and I support it.","Let gay people get married.","My mom's side, they're southern Baptist Christian.","I empty myself out and fill myself with the character. I would play a devil worshipper, and I would fill myself up with whatever devil worshippers believe. Then, as myself, I empty that out and become Nelsan.","There were not many black students at Juilliard, unfortunately. So when you get there, you become very good friends, in particular, with the other black students.","My years at Thornridge probably changed the course of my life.","I had no intention of being an actor.","My idea of horses is from when I grew up on a farm. They were big, and they were dumb.","It's hard to get an education when teachers spend 70 percent of their time trying to discipline students.","Acting is the only thing that makes me happy.","I was quiet, and I was artistic. I liked writing poetry, and that was very strange, so I was bullied a lot.","I rejected being a lot of things that I grew up in, and yet I didn't. I got all my tactics from where I grew up... I can talk about all the people in those environments more than I can talk about the teachers at Juilliard or anyone else.","I'm not an emotional person; I keep it in, and I wouldn't know how to get it out if it weren't for acting and writing.","The sci-fi fans in America... they are die-hard. They will follow you to the ends of the Earth. Once they attach themselves to a show and believe in the show and love the characters, they're there forever, and they're unshakeable.","I went from unknown to having no anonymity.","At some point in my life, I wanted to be in a vampire movie.","I am a vampire/werewolf and sci-fi fanatic. God is so good! I get to play in a series that has all that!","Anna Paquin is marvelous, and she brings so much experience to the table.","'Interview with a Vampire' is my all-time favorite. I also loved 'An American Werewolf in London.'","Alan Ball, he's good at challenging his actors, I'll say that.","I see a project, and I say I want to audition for it, and people let me audition for it. There's a lot to be grateful for.","Fiona Shaw is a goddess to me.","I don't look anything like my mother, except when I'm Lafayette. I look like my father.","When I wanted to become a serious actor, this girl told me, 'You should go to Juilliard.' And I said, 'Okay.'","The ultimate part that I want to play in my life is Jimi Hendrix, so I guess I'm drawn to music even though I can't sing or dance very well.","When you act with phenomenal actors, it makes your job much easier because all you have to do is react.","You have to be a tough gay person in the South.","You go back to my town, it's like going back to the 1960s... just not a great place to grow up.","You have to learn to not hate who you have to live with.","Everybody kept saying, 'I just don't know how to sell you.' I'm odd. I don't think you can put a finger on me.","Although I can be a leading man, you wouldn't look at me and go, 'He's a leading man.'","Whenever you have a character in which one of his defining qualities is his sexuality, it's always challenging, because you don't want to bring in someone who's going to play that in a phony way.","I was raised by women.","I can't approach a character with judgment.","The arts are suffering amongst public schools, but also, minority theater companies are struggling, and I firmly believe in freedom of expression through the arts."],"Nelson A. Miles":["The Indians, however, could not migrate from one part of the United States to another; neither could they obtain employment as readily as white people, either upon or beyond the Indian reservations.","If we dismiss from our minds the prejudice we may have against the Indians we shall be able to more clearly understand the impulses that govern both races.","For a time during the early settlement of this country peace and goodwill prevailed, only to be followed later by violent and relentless warfare.","On the contrary, if they are treated with justice and humanity, proper example and the advantages of education given them, the coming years will be as bright and prosperous to the unfortunate race as the past has been dark and painful.","A Christian people who have for two hundred years kept a race in bondage, deprived of the advantages of civilization and religion, owe them a debt of gratitude which it would seem ungenerous to withhold.","The troops were occasionally occupied in pursuing scattered bands going north or south, and on three occasions the large camp of Sitting Bull ventured south of the Canadian border, and important expeditions were sent against them.","To illustrate to the Indians the advantages the white race had in the telephone I divided a body of warriors from Sitting Bull's camp into two parties and had them talk to each other over the telephone line.","If the graves of the thousands of victims who have fallen in the terrible wars of the two races had been placed in line the philanthropist might travel from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Lakes to the Gulf, and be constantly in sight of green mounds.","The more we study the Indian's character the more we appreciate the marked distinction between the civilized being and the real savage.","It is unfair to suppose that one party has invariably acted rightly, and that the other is responsible for every wrong that has been committed.","One hundred years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, the Spanish government issued a decree authorizing the enslavement of the American Indian as in accord with the law of God and man.","Step by step a powerful and enterprising race has driven them back from the Atlantic to the West until at last there is scarcely a spot of ground upon which the Indians have any certainty of maintaining a permanent abode.","Our relations with the Indians have been governed chiefly by treaties and trade, or war and subjugation.","No administration could stop the tidal wave of immigration that swept over the land; no political party could restrain or control the enterprise of our people, and no reasonable man could desire to check the march of civilization.","The intrusions of the white race and the non- compliance with treaty obligations have been followed by atrocities that could alone satisfy a savage and revengeful spirit.","Looking at the purpose of our government toward the Indians, we find that after subjugating them it has been our policy to collect the different tribes on reservations and support them at the expense of our people.","Whether or not our system of Indian management has been a success during the past ten, fifty, or hundred years is almost answered in the asking.","The tide of immigration in Canada has not been as great as along our frontier. They have been able to allow the Indians to live as Indians, which we have not, and do not attempt to force upon them the customs which are distasteful to them.","These are hallowed moments, when every American has reason to express his gratitude to Almighty God that it has been our good fortune to witness the light of this auspicious morn."],"Nelson Algren":["The hard necessity of bringing the judge on the bench down into the dock has been the peculiar responsibility of the writer in all ages of man.","Never play cards with a man called Doc. Never eat at a place called Mom's. Never sleep with a woman whose troubles are worse than your own.","I've always felt strongly that a writer shouldn't be engaged with other writers, or with people who make books, or even with people who read them. I think the farther away you get from the literary traffic, the closer you are to sources. I mean, a writer doesn't really live; he observes.","Chicago is an October sort of city even in spring.","Loving Chicago is like loving a woman with a broken nose.","I went out there for a thousand a week, and I worked Monday, and I got fired Wednesday. The guy that hired me was out of town Tuesday.","Literature is made upon any occasion that a challenge is put to the legal apparatus by conscience in touch with humanity.","The Impossible Generalized Man today is the critic who believes in loving those unworthy of love as well as those worthy - yet believes this only insofar as no personal risk is entailed. Meaning he loves no one, worthy or no. This is what makes him impossible.","The struggle to write with profundity of emotion and at the same time to live like a millionaire so exhausted F. Scott Fitzgerald that he was at last brought down to the point where he could no longer be both a good writer and a decent person.","It isn't till now, in the American Century, as we have recklessly dubbed it, that tribal pressures toward conformity have been brought to bear so ruthlessly upon men and women seeking to work creatively.","The reason nobody investigates the men who are trading off our freedoms for private enrichment is that they are the very ones who are doing the investigating.","The American middle class's faith in personal comfort as an end in itself is, in essence, a denial of life. And it has been imposed upon American writers and playwrights strongly enough to cut them off from their deeper sources.","Obsession remains the price of creation, and the writer who declines that risk will come up with nothing more creative than 'The Foxes of Harrow' or 'Mrs. Parkington.'","I've always figured the only way I could finish a book and get a plot was just to keep making it longer and longer until something happens - you know, until it finds its own plot - because you can't outline and then fit the thing into it. I suppose it's a slow way of working.","I do have the feeling that other writers can't help you with writing. I've gone to writers' conferences and writers' sessions and writers' clinics, and the more I see of them, the more I'm sure it's the wrong direction. It isn't the place where you learn to write.","I don't think the isolation of the American writer is a tradition; it's more that, geographically, he just is isolated, unless he happens to live in New York City. But I don't suppose there's a small town around the country that doesn't have a writer.","I don't think I've ever been either militant or profound as an anti-Fascist. When the issue has come up, when certain things have come up, and I've been called on to express - literally, when I've been cornered, then I take a left-wing stand.","If you write something, and you believe in it, you'd like to see sixty million people moved by it.","I am against censorship. I don't think there is anything more stupid than censorship.","Since I'm essentially optimistic, I can't imagine a world in which man is totally decimated or degraded.","I'd put the ninety-nine billion dollars - whatever it is - that's being appropriated for the Air Force and the Navy, and I'd put it into schools. I'd put it into traveling scholarships.","New York is the place where they bind books and write blurbs and arrange the publicity and print the galleys... But Chicago is the place where the book is lived out before it is bound and the song is sung before it is recorded."],"Nelson Boswell":["The difference between greatness and mediocrity is often how an individual views a mistake.","Here is the simple but powerful rule... always give people more than they expect to get.","The first and most important step toward success is the feeling that we can succeed.","What we must try to be, of course, is ourselves and wholeheartedly. We must find out what we really are and what we really want."],"Nelson Bunker Hunt":["People who know how much they're worth aren't usually worth that much.","A billion dollars isn't what it used to be."],"Nelson Cruz":["You can watch videos and hit off the tee, stuff like that, but at the same time, it's you against the pitcher. I just need one swing or one pitch to click, and you can find your swing.","When you get a chance to get a W, that's the most important thing.","I always have high expectations for me.","There's nothing worse than seeing your teammates battle, knowing you can't help."],"Nelson DeMille":["I generally unwind by having dinner with close friends.","We're all pilgrims on the same journey - but some pilgrims have better road maps.","Somehow our devils are never quite what we expect when we meet them face to face.","Writing doesn't leave much time for hobbies, unless you consider that I began writing as a hobby and have made the hobby into a profession.","I thought to myself, what is everyone's worst fear? Nuclear terrorism in America.","There is no terra incognito left.","If everyone howled at every injustice, every act of barbarism, every act of unkindness, then we would be taking the first step towards a real humanity.","It's good to stay as close to real life as you can, and then kind of dress it up.","I've always been fascinated by the Gold Coast. The homes themselves are spectacular, unlike anything you'll see other than in Newport, Bar Harbor or Palm Beach. It's a very special area that, because of local demographics, is not going to survive much longer.","There are a lot of books about the passing of the English aristocracy, but the vast majority of Long Islanders don't understand their own backyard. It's a private preserve.","There are Mafia families that have bought magnificent houses on the North Shore, although not yet the great estates because they don't want that kind of high profile.","I used the pen name because I knew I wanted to write better novels under my own name someday.","I like the process of pencil and paper as opposed to a machine. I think the writing is better when it's done in handwriting.","I don't name sources.","Stephen King once told me he liked my writing. And that was great.","I had a very strong desire to be successful at something.","I read 'Time', 'Newsweek' and 'The Economist'.","The world has gotten smaller and more accessible since I first started writing in the 70's.","You have to go out of your way as a suspense novelist to find situations where the protagonists are somewhat helpless and in real danger.","G.I. humor is similar to cop humor.","Even the most radical Islamic terrorist would not want to see the revered holy city of Medina go up. It would be like losing the Vatican in Rome.","Chemical and biological attacks are scary and will kill a lot of people but don't rise to the level of nuclear."],"Nelson Eddy":["In society, one doesn't tell the truth, one tells the exact opposite.","Let's have the music that will open the door to millions of people... the kind of music that will not make people think only of the song or even of the singer... not music that is confined to the merely personal."],"Nelson Goodman":["Coming to understand a painting or a symphony in an unfamiliar style, to recognize the work of an artist or school, to see or hear in new ways, is as cognitive an achievement as learning to read or write or add.","Truth cannot be defined or tested by agreement with 'the world'; for not only do truths differ for different worlds but the nature of agreement between a world apart from it is notoriously nebulous.","I am concerned, rather, that there should not be more things dreamt of in my philosophy than there actually are in heaven and earth."],"Nelson Mandela":["Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.","It always seems impossible until it's done.","I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.","A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination.","After climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb.","To deny people their human rights is to challenge their very humanity.","It is better to lead from behind and to put others in front, especially when you celebrate victory when nice things occur. You take the front line when there is danger. Then people will appreciate your leadership.","Forget the past.","As long as poverty, injustice and gross inequality persist in our world, none of us can truly rest.","Money won't create success, the freedom to make it will.","I dream of an Africa which is in peace with itself.","There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living.","There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere, and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires.","Courageous people do not fear forgiving, for the sake of peace.","Where globalization means, as it so often does, that the rich and powerful now have new means to further enrich and empower themselves at the cost of the poorer and weaker, we have a responsibility to protest in the name of universal freedom.","No country can really develop unless its citizens are educated.","We pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other discrimination.","Without education, your children can never really meet the challenges they will face. So it's very important to give children education and explain that they should play a role for their country.","If there are dreams about a beautiful South Africa, there are also roads that lead to their goal. Two of these roads could be named Goodness and Forgiveness.","A good leader can engage in a debate frankly and thoroughly, knowing that at the end he and the other side must be closer, and thus emerge stronger. You don't have that idea when you are arrogant, superficial, and uninformed.","Our human compassion binds us the one to the other - not in pity or patronizingly, but as human beings who have learnt how to turn our common suffering into hope for the future.","For to be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.","There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered.","There are many people who feel that it is useless and futile to continue talking about peace and non-violence against a government whose only reply is savage attacks on an unarmed and defenseless people.","There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.","Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all.","If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.","After one has been in prison, it is the small things that one appreciates: being able to take a walk whenever one wants, going into a shop and buying a newspaper, speaking or choosing to remain silent. The simple act of being able to control one's person.","In my country we go to prison first and then become President.","When the water starts boiling it is foolish to turn off the heat.","I dream of the realization of the unity of Africa, whereby its leaders combine in their efforts to solve the problems of this continent. I dream of our vast deserts, of our forests, of all our great wildernesses.","People respond in accordance to how you relate to them. If you approach them on the basis of violence, that's how they'll react. But if you say, 'We want peace, we want stability,' we can then do a lot of things that will contribute towards the progress of our society.","There is no such thing as part freedom.","Whatever position I occupied, it was the result of colleagues - of my comrades in the movement - who had decided in their wisdom to use me for the purpose of focusing the attention of the country and the international community on me.","My son has died of AIDS.","There is nothing I fear more than waking up without a program that will help me bring a little happiness to those with no resources, those who are poor, illiterate, and ridden with terminal disease.","There are many people in South Africa who are rich and who can share those riches with those not so fortunate who have not been able to conquer poverty.","Let freedom reign. The sun never set on so glorious a human achievement.","There are times when a leader must move out ahead of the flock, go off in a new direction, confident that he is leading his people the right way.","Even if you have a terminal disease, you don't have to sit down and mope. Enjoy life and challenge the illness that you have.","I started to make a study of the art of war and revolution and, whilst abroad, underwent a course in military training. If there was to be guerrilla warfare, I wanted to be able to stand and fight with my people and to share the hazards of war with them.","I stand here before you not as a prophet, but as a humble servant of you, the people.","Give a child love, laughter and peace, not AIDS.","I do not deny that I planned sabotage. I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness nor because I have any love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after many years of tyranny, exploitation and oppression of my people by the whites.","I am confident that nobody... will accuse me of selfishness if I ask to spend time, while I am still in good health, with my family, my friends and also with myself.","On the first day of school, my teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave each of us an English name and said that from thenceforth that was the name we would answer to in school. This was the custom among Africans in those days and was undoubtedly due to the British bias of our education.","By ancestry, I was born to rule.","If you want to make peace with your enemy, you have to work with your enemy. Then he becomes your partner.","Only free men can negotiate. A prisoner cannot enter into contracts.","Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another.","I cannot say for certain if there is such a thing as love at first sight, but I do know that the moment I first glimpsed Winnie Nomzamo, I knew that I wanted to have her as my wife.","I was not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had become a leader because of extraordinary circumstances.","Running taught me valuable lessons. In cross-country competition, training counted more than intrinsic ability, and I could compensate for a lack of natural aptitude with diligence and discipline. I applied this in everything I did.","You know, you can only lead them from behind.","I can't pretend that I'm brave and that I can beat the whole world.","The education I received was a British education, in which British ideas, British culture, British institutions, were automatically assumed to be superior. There was no such thing as African culture.","Leaders in all spheres who are living with HIV should be encouraged, not coerced, to lead by example and disclose their HIV status.","I have retired, but if there's anything that would kill me it is to wake up in the morning not knowing what to do.","If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world, it is the United States of America.","Let us give publicity to H.I.V./AIDS and not hide it, because the only way to make it appear like a normal illness like TB, like cancer, is always to come out and say somebody has died because of H.I.V./AIDS, and people will stop regarding it as something extraordinary.","Our daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an actual South African reality that will reinforce humanity's belief in justice, strengthen its confidence in the nobility of the human soul, and sustain all our hopes for a glorious life for all.","If you are poor, you are not likely to live long.","At the outset, I want to say that the suggestion that the struggle in South Africa is under the influence of foreigners or communists is wholly incorrect. I have done whatever I did because of my experience in South Africa and my own proudly felt African background, and not because of what any outsider might have said.","As an attorney, I could be rather flamboyant in court. I did not act as though I were a black man in a white man's court, but as if everyone else - white and black - was a guest in my court. When trying a case, I often made sweeping gestures and used high-flown language.","I really wanted to retire and rest and spend more time with my children, my grandchildren and of course with my wife.","I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.","In countries where innocent people are dying, the leaders are following their blood rather than their brains.","Any man or institution that tries to rob me of my dignity will lose.","I detest racialism, because I regard it as a barbaric thing, whether it comes from a black man or a white man.","I should tie myself to no particular system of society other than of socialism.","If the United States of America or Britain is having elections, they don't ask for observers from Africa or from Asia. But when we have elections, they want observers.","We can't afford to be killing one another.","Especially for those of us who lived in single cells, you had the time to sit down and think, and we discovered that sitting down just to think is one of the best ways of keeping yourself fresh and able, to be able to address the problems facing you, and you had the opportunity, also, of examining your past.","Unlike some politicians, I can admit to a mistake.","I was called a terrorist yesterday, but when I came out of jail, many people embraced me, including my enemies, and that is what I normally tell other people who say those who are struggling for liberation in their country are terrorists.","Does anybody really think that they didn't get what they had because they didn't have the talent or the strength or the endurance or the commitment?","I realized quickly what Mandela and Tambo meant to ordinary Africans. It was a place where they could come and find a sympathetic ear and a competent ally, a place where they would not be either turned away or cheated, a place where they might actually feel proud to be represented by men of their own skin color.","When I came to Johannesburg from the countryside, I knew nobody, but many strangers were very kind to me. I then was dragged into politics, and then, subsequently, I became a lawyer.","From the beginning, Mandela and Tambo was besieged with clients. We were not the only African lawyers in South Africa, but we were the only firm of African lawyers. For Africans, we were the firm of first choice and last resort.","Intervention only works when the people concerned seem to be keen for peace.","Communists have always played an active role in the fight by colonial countries for their freedom, because the short-term objects of Communism would always correspond with the long-term objects of freedom movements.","I will not leave South Africa, nor will I surrender. Only through hardship, sacrifice and militant action can freedom be won. The struggle is my life. I will continue fighting for freedom until the end of my days.","Sometimes, I feel like one who is on the sidelines, who has missed life itself.","I have always regarded myself, in the first place, as an African patriot.","Our single most important challenge is therefore to help establish a social order in which the freedom of the individual will truly mean the freedom of the individual.","The United States has made serious mistakes in the conduct of its foreign affairs, which have had unfortunate repercussions long after the decisions were taken.","It is wise to persuade people to do things and make them think it was their own idea.","I have been influenced in my thinking by both west and east.","I made a mistake by being ejected from the presidency. Next time, I will choose a Cabinet which will allow me to be life President.","Nonviolence is a good policy when the conditions permit.","The titanic effort that has brought liberation to South Africa, and ensured the total liberation of Africa, constitutes an act of redemption for the black people of the world.","Sabotage did not involve loss of life, and it offered the best hope for future race relations. Bitterness would be kept to a minimum and, if the policy bore fruit, democratic government could become a reality.","Apart from life, a strong constitution, and an abiding connection to the Thembu royal house, the only thing my father bestowed upon me at birth was a name, Rolihlahla.","In the 1940s, traveling for an African was a complicated process. All Africans over the age of sixteen were compelled to carry 'Native passes' issued by the Native Affairs Department and were required to show that pass to any white policeman, civil servant, or employer. Failure to do so could mean arrest, trial, a jail sentence or fine.","I would wear the blue overalls of the fieldworker and often wore round, rimless glasses known as Mazzawati teaglasses. I had a car, and I wore a chauffeur's cap with my overalls. The pose of chauffeur was convenient because I could travel under the pretext of driving my master's car.","Africans require, want, the franchise on the basis of one man one vote. They want political independence.","The names of Dingane and Bambata, Hintsa and Makana, Squngthi and Dalasile, Moshoeshoe and Sekhukhuni, were praised as the glory of the entire African nation. I hoped then that life might offer me the opportunity to serve my people and make my own humble contribution to their freedom struggle.","I cannot conceive of Israel withdrawing if Arab states do not recognize Israel, within secure borders.","I was first imprisoned in Pretoria, and then, thereafter, I was taken to Robben Island. I stayed there for a couple of weeks. I was taken back to Pretoria when I was charged in the Rivonia trial, when I was then sent to Robben Island for life.","Prison life, fortunately, I spent a lot of years, about 18 years with other prisoners, and, as I say, they enriched your soul.","There are so many men and women who hold no distinctive positions but whose contribution towards the development of society has been enormous.","Let each know that for each the body, the mind and the soul have been freed to fulfill themselves.","Before I went to jail, I was active in politics as a member of South Africa's leading organization - and I was generally busy from 7 A.M. until midnight. I never had time to sit and think.","I came across few whites as a boy at Qunu. The local magistrate, of course, was white, as was the nearest shopkeeper. Occasionally, white travelers or policemen passed through our area. These whites appeared as grand as gods to me, and I was aware that they were to be treated with a mixture of fear and respect."],"Nelson Peltz":["I'm willing to have two directors on the DuPont board, me being one of them.","I spent most of my career operating businesses and fixing businesses, not staring at a Bloomberg screen.","If I'm on the board of any company where there's an offer that comes in, I want to negotiate.","Rupert Murdoch is a good friend of mine.","I don't mind anybody coming after me as long as they're coming with facts.","After Cadbury, the candy company, separated from Dr. Pepper, the soft drinks maker, Cadbury was able to substantially lower its debt load. The profits of Cadbury, the candy company, zoomed.","The activists play the balance sheet by selling a division to buy back stock and leveraging the balance sheet and buying back more stock.","Before, Tiffany sold watches only in its own stores. Now, Tiffany watches are sold in 1,500 stores.","Legg Mason's structure is misunderstood by the market. Legg Mason has an affiliate model. They own 100% of their affiliates, which are investment managers such as Permal, Western Asset Management, and Royce.","You know what term you don't hear anymore? Arbitrage. The markets have gotten too efficient.","I understood the power of Heinz since I was a kid, and I started to work for my father selling food to restaurants.","Sequestration, sequestation - however you pronounce that word - and gridlock aren't all that bad.","I love women.","Sometimes it takes longer to create value, but if the companies generate more earnings, the stocks will ultimately reflect that.","The name 'Mondelez' I hate. It sounds like a disease.","You must make some decisions Wall Street dislikes.","I try to figure out the marketing puzzle.","My kids are exhausted every day, and I keep them that way. It's gym, ice, homework. They're too tired to get in trouble.","I believe in pay for performance.","It appears that PepsiCo views structural change as a sign of weakness, an admission of failure, and an untenable break with past traditions."],"Nelson Piquet":["Events like this mean we can give something back to the people that support us, and hopefully everyone will have a great day and we can put on a good show for them.","The Lotus is a couple of years newer than the Williams was, and as the pace of development in F1 cars is so quick, I expect it to be another completely different experience, but still one that I know I'm going to enjoy.","After hurting myself like that, I could not go back immediately to racing. I was in no condition, mentally or physically. That helped me to strengthen myself to go through the hard times that were ahead with my business, and to be successful.","I am really looking forward to driving another of my father's car at the show in Rotterdam.","I have quite a lot of fans in Holland because that is where my mother is from, in fact I have a fan club there, and the fans don't always get the chance to see us drive the cars because getting to races across Europe isn't always possible for them.","In two years, I'll be making more than Michael Schumacher.","It is going to be special to drive in the Netherlands because it means I can take part in a Formula One demonstration in a country where I have a lot of family and friends.","Through F1, I bought my own boat. I learned to fly my own plane and helicopter. And my job with my company is a reflection of everything motor racing taught me."],"Nelson Rockefeller":["Never forget that the most powerful force on earth is love.","America is not just a power, it is a promise. It is not enough for our country to be extraordinary in might; it must be exemplary in meaning.","The secret to success is to own nothing, but control everything.","There are three periods in life: youth, middle age and 'how well you look'.","It is essential that we enable young people to see themselves as participants in one of the most exciting eras in history, and to have a sense of purpose in relation to it.","The chief problem of low-income farmers is poverty."],"Neneh Cherry":["When you lose a parent, you realize how vital they are to the foundation of your life. It's impossible to understand what it means until that curtain is pulled. You're an orphan. But then I think that life is kind of remarkable, and the thing that causes the biggest pain can also bring amazing energy.","I have absorbed my life now. I am ready for my music to unfold. I know time flies, but before the end of this year, the album will be out. Even if it kills me.","I'm a bit of a rebel, and I always will be.","I think I've grown up in a mixed environment, and maybe a lot of the time I haven't really belonged anywhere in the way I've dreamt of belonging to, you know, living on the street and playing to all the kids on the street, growing up together. I suppose 'Raw Like Sushi' was a place where all of those things could come together.","Everyone in Sweden has great hair and teeth and is clean-cut and organised.","I don't think I would have made 'Blank Project; if I hadn't made 'Cherry Thing.' I think that was a real rebirth in a way, and a remembrance of how I like to make music best, the most. Like being in a more chaotic place, maybe. Like a place of making and being creative where the mistakes can be left in.","I've always looked to other women for inspiration and kicks. When a woman stands up and does her thing, it never ceases to excite and inspire me.","What's sometimes really overwhelming in Sweden is the uniformity. People kind of disappear by all looking the same and wearing the same clothes. There are a lot of great individuals, but it can become a very blank and bleak picture.","You come to these thresholds in your life where you need to remember why you do what you do, to reconnect with yourself. When I look back at something like 'Raw Like Sushi,' I think I was very much in the right place at the right time.","Who needs a handbag? I put my money in my bra.","My kids love Ibiza and we feel committed to it because we keep coming back to the same area. People recognise us in shops now and we have a social life here. We cook at home and have friends around.","We'd boil this whisky because we thought that would make it stronger. So we thought we were getting drunk, but in fact there'd be no alcohol left in it.","There's been a lot of coming home in the early mornings after funny nights out, having bizarre sandwiches in bed.","When I found out I was pregnant, my mother said, 'Don't separate your life, the life that you're going to make with this child, from the things that you are and what you want to do.'","I am not super-ambitious. I am not a classically amazing singer or anything.","I try not to be superstitious, but, you know, we never put any shoes on the table. That's totally against the law in our house. And I always salute when I see one magpie.","I'm allergic to doing the obvious thing.","When I'm singing or on stage, I become complete all of a sudden. I'm whole. I don't think I've really had that in so many other things in my life.","I've always worked with my partner, my husband, Cameron, since 'Raw Like Sushi,' and in a way, I feel very free with what I do, but he also has an amazing insight in having intuitions that tend to be right a lot of the time, about where we should go next.","I'm 50. And I'm not ever really worried about being trendy.","I don't think you can cover a song unless you love it and have a relationship with it. With 'Golden Heart' I felt a sense of responsibility. And when we were recording it in the studio, it felt almost dream-like. Something you might hear if you were in Senegal, with someone singing from the mosque in the morning just as the sun's coming up.","When me and my brother Eagle-Eye were kids, life was about hitting the road, getting on the bus. We loved it.","Rip Rig & Panic was a milestone for me, and I've always been really thankful that I did that when I was 16. It saved me for when I suddenly became really successful later on. So even when my head's been spinning like a banshee, my feet still feel held down to the ground.","I think I've always been slightly addicted to not repeating myself. When you're doing something the first time around, it's often the best time. I think 'Blank Project' is about carrying on. Its that thing where you're making something because you have to, but you don't know how or why.","Being a grandmother is one of the least strange things in my life. It makes more sense than a lot of things... like photo shoots!","I haven't lived in Sweden since I was a teenager. We lived in southern Sweden, about two hours north of Copenhagen, where my family's home base has been since 1970. Our parents bought a schoolhouse in preparation for self-sufficient living. They wanted to create a place to do all the things they believed in.","I always found very strong images for my songwriting in New York.","I don't live my life through my kids, nor do I expect them to live theirs through mine. But of course, they're everything.","The race is your face. Obviously, I come from a mixed background. Who I am and how I look and being black.","When 'Raw Like Sushi' came out in the U.S., I wasn't considered to be black enough. They didn't really know where to put me. The music wasn't 'black black' sounding. It wasn't R&B; it wasn't straight up hip-hop, although obviously in that dimension and world.","My daughters are my Picassos.","If you want to make God happy, tell him your plans.","I'm not an amazingly trained soul singer, so with me it's about feeling and energy and spontaneity - that's a really big part of who I am.","I'm quite a particular singer, and I need to feel like I can bite into the song, in a way, to make it my own. You want the challenge of the songs having some attitude.","I've never really thought of my real life - you know, the one I wake up to and fall asleep to at night - as being a pop star's life.","I like Kelela. I like Twigs. I love the more old school; I hate to say old school, but I love Peaches; I love Peaches, I love Cat Power. And there's constantly new things coming up. But there's something so beautifully powerful - for me being a woman, when there's a woman doing something, it really strikes a chord.","I love Robyn, not just because we've worked together. I mean, that's why we've worked together - because I love her.","I love collard greens and sweet potatoes. But like, traveling, I'm always just looking for that thing where you feel like there's love in the food. Like one of the best things, in Brazil it's feijoada. I was in Tobago in the winter, and I had the best roti I've ever had, with curry goat.","I admire someone like Beyonce. She has amazing commitment. I needed to accept that I probably did not fit into that forum. Doing that 'The Cherry Thing' record was a big part of finding that place where I belong, where I may shine, but I never doubted it was there.","Both my parents were working-class and had dreams of making the world a better place. It's pretty powerful, being able to reflect back their beliefs.","When I was going to school, I just wanted to be like everybody else. I would pull at my hair to try and get it to lie straight. America was where I would consume and absorb black culture, buy Ultra Sheen and watch 'Soul Train,' but I still had that weird in-between thing.","I found my place when I moved to London, where I chose to live, making my own tribe who were all from different backgrounds and places. The class thing is very dominant there, but in the cultural cross-fertilization, I felt a sense of belonging.","I was on tour with Little Dragon with the Gorillaz. She's got an amazing voice and is a lovely girl. Her vibe is fresh pressed and harmless fun with a tinge of the dark side if you look in the right bits of the tunes.","Frank Ocean is our modern-day Marvin Gaye. In our house, we have nothing but respect for him.","A lot of young musicians in Stockholm are about keeping tradition alive and moving it forward at the same time.","Some people might be groomed for success; I've just always thought I've got a hell of a lot of things to learn and places to go. Creatively, I couldn't stay on the same treadmill. I chose to be off-centre and do collaborative work.","I've never been very good at fitting into boxes.","I was a punk when I was 15 - I was definitely into it in a big way and loved it - but I came to London when punk was maybe where you'd say punk is dead.","Rip Rig + Panic that I joined, they were really influenced by jazz and blues and punk. So I think what happened from punk, which was kind of DIY, was that it created a kind of creative place that was kind of without limits, in a way.","To me, a song is a song when you can sit in a room and just sing it from end to end.","I've never really spent too much or put too much gravity or placed too much importance on being a pop star. It's like, OK, great, does that mean I don't have to do anything anymore except walk around and be a pop star?","Rhythm, that's an essential part of cooking. The sound of a lovely song and the smell of some dish in the oven are equally evocative.","For me, making music is about my whole life. The basics, the components, simple things - family, living, just going to the market and getting new fruit and veg. That's what keeps my blood flowing."],"Neon Hitch":["I've lived in many things - boats, caravans, and buses. I've been homeless, I've had no money: everything. But I believe in magic, and having a vision. The tough times made me a warrior. I work hard.","I've never been able to relate to many people. I've always been the outcast child. I don't follow the rules. That's kind of how I do everything. Through my music, I've found a place in the world where I'm accepted, so I'm happy.","Fitting in is unnecessary. Embrace who you are. You will go through rough times in high school, but always stay strong, and never deny yourself!","I like to be wild, and I like to do wild, crazy things. I need excitement. At all times. Normal is not my type.","There is a lot you don't know about me - a lot. I have definitely lived, that's for sure. I will just leave it at that.","I grew up in a bus, traveled with various circuses and freak shows. I was a trapeze artist, and that was my dream. We just traveled the whole world, me and my mom and my little brothers and sisters. It was an adventure.","I didn't go to school, because I never stayed anywhere long enough, so I was completely closed off from the outside world. I had no idea about anything.","The day I was born, my house burnt down; the day I left home, the Twin Towers burnt down; and I lived in a jungle in India at 15.","I was always a bit of a showgirl; it was in my blood. I never thought I would have a career as a singer, though.","Yes, it's my real name. I had to pull out my passport twice today to prove it.","I think redheads have more fun than blondes.","I'm out here to represent the gingers, the gypsies, and the outcasts. Because I am all of the above, and I'm all about having a great time.","The trapeze was my first love. To me, it's normal. It's all I've ever known. But when I see other people's upbringings, I think, 'Hmm... mine was rather unconventional. Quite different!'","I have a little gypsy palace here in New York. It's all mirrors, and I have my own garden. It's so secluded - the closest thing to a caravan I could find!","My ancestors are all crazy. My great-great-granddad, he was the last man to live in a cave in Nottingham.","You should hear what my parents wanted to call me. It was between Brown Rice, Neon Hitch and Z. Ziggurat Zanzibar Zandorf. I'm not joking. Imagine fitting that on my passport!","You can't party all the time - especially in January!","I love to experiment with fashion. A lot of my inspiration comes from my mom. She is fearless with fashion! I love colors and anything daring.","I think for an artist it's really important to have experiences, and I've had a lot of those. It's definitely inspired my lyrics and my style, even down to what I wear.","I'm a free spirit and that definitely comes from my upbringing, so it's definitely shaped me as an artist.","What I really want to do is, first of all, get my music out to the world. And then I would really just like to reach other kids all over the world and tell them to believe in themselves and prove to people that you can do anything you want.","I don't believe in trying to be somebody you're not - just be a bigger, better version of yourself."],"Neri Oxman":["When I came to MIT, there were four rubrics: science, art, design, and technology. And as you entered your degree, whether it was a master's or a Ph.D., if you were a citizen in one domain, you were a traveler in the other.","Binaries aside, we are the products of our relationships with our identities - cities we have built, bodies we have embraced, kindred souls we've cherished, our memories, our dreams, the fears we hide, the pain we hold - identities that cannot be reduced to a collection of labels.","One cannot separate the spider web's form from the way in which it originated.","I appreciate good tailoring as much as good details of construction.","I like to mostly wear very simple clothes.","To wear a beautiful new garment is like wearing a new idea, and I see them as the same thing. Opening my closet is a form of meditation. I pick whatever I feel is right for the day.","When you celebrate a new idea, it immediately comes through the way you hold yourself and the clothes you wear.","In the end, it's clear that the incorporation of synthetic biology in product and architectural design will enable the transition from designs that are inspired by nature to designs made with and by nature to, possibly, designing nature herself.","Look at spiders. They use about eight different properties of silk for different functions. The spider is like a multimaterial 3D printer.","Could we design an all-glass building with internal channels and networks for airflow and water circulation? Can we surpass the great modern tradition of discrete formal and functional partitions and generate an all-in-one building skin?","Because glass is at once structural and transparent, it is relatively easy to consider the integration of structural and environmental building performance within a single integrated skin.","Choice is a form of compromise, no? So why choose if you can have both?","I believe in the balance between dreaming and building.","If you think about it, the printing press allowed everyone to print books - it democratised the printing of information. For the first time, we could all print.","I am equally fascinated and awed by visiting an Alexander McQueen show as I am looking under a microscope.","I don't think of fashion as fashion or biology as biology.","I don't think I would have made for a good doctor. It was not meant to be, and it took me a long time to realize that.","I don't separate architecture, design, or culture. What's more important is a language of creativity that carries meaning.","Prior to the Industrial Revolution, hand-production methods were abundant. Craft defined everything. The craftsman had an almost phenomenological knowledge of materials and intuited how to vary their properties according to their structural and environmental characteristics.","Craft meets the machine in rapid fabrication. We can generate craft with the help of technology.","The 3D-printing technology has been developing at a very rapid pace.","In traditional 3D printing, the gantry size poses an obvious limitation for the designer who wishes to print in larger scales and achieve structural and material complexity.","We've managed to motion-track the silkworm's movement as it is building its cocoon. Our aim was to translate the motion-capture data into a 3D printer connected to a robotic arm in order to study the biological structure in larger scales.","We need to treat the planet as a system, and up until now, we've operated more as if the world were made of separate parts - this part is environment, this part is economy. But everything is connected. You can't fix global warming with a Ph.D. in thermodynamics!","It is only through hard work and awareness that we can truly own our identity.","If you believe in Cinderella, and if you can suspend your disbelief at midnight, then you can believe in the interdisciplinary midnight, the 'in-betweens,' and become fortunately entangled, moving from art to science.","A great dream of mine would be to run a design studio full of scientists who think about science as creatively as if they were doing art.","At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production. Assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, framing the imagination of designers and architects who have been trained to think about their objects as assemblies of discrete parts with distinct functions.","I like to think of synthetic biology as liquid alchemy, only instead of transmuting precious metals, you're synthesizing new biological functionality inside very small channels. It's called microfluidics.","The second-most abundant biopolymer on the planet is called chitin, and some 100 million tons of it are produced every year by organisms such as shrimps, crabs, scorpions, and butterflies. We thought if we could tune its properties, we could generate structures that are multifunctional out of a single part.","I often ask myself, 'What would design be like if objects were made of a single part? Would we return to a better state of creation?'","Although I often find that the feminist rhetoric - not feminism - can come across as simple-minded, self-regarding, nuance-averse and reductive - biology to physiology, history to psychology, procreation to gynecology, and so on - I have come to realize that we should all be feminists.","Gender is more of a continuum than we are willing to admit when we hit the restroom.","I loathe categorization. I cherish my independence, and I treasure chivalry. I live just fine with ambiguity, and I welcome a good quarrel about all things designed or grown - except for when men misnomer 'confident' with 'poised' and 'passionate' with 'feisty.' I work hard.","For the same reason we have the Brad Pitts and the George Clooneys, it's just part of human nature to idolize stereotypes.","Our facial skins are thin with large pores; our back skins are thicker with small pores. One acts mainly as filter, the other mainly as barrier. And yet, it's the same skin, no parts, no assemblies. It's a system that gradually varies its functionality by varying elasticity.","I approach the world as a whole by taking an integrative approach, not a world of parts, and I like to bring different fields and disciplines together. The same is true with my preoccupation with cultural expression.","I'm not a mother of children, but I'm a different type of mother where my approach to design is more in line with nature. It's less about dictating and more about editing and listening and allowing something to grow. So I nourish and let the material express what it wants to be.","In the United States alone, 450 billion square feet of glass facade is produced every year. What if we could take this chance to use the glass to harness solar energy and allow the architecture to respond to the light and heat of the sun, to create photosynthesis and generate solar energy?","In many ways, I think I'm still forming my ideas about my own identity in this world.","In nature, there is no separation between design, engineering, and fabrication; the bone does it all.","I am inspired by alchemy and all things continuous, uninterrupted, and effortlessly fused into wholes.","All great cinema has the sense of the dynamic, the transitional, mixed with the mythical and the sense of ritual.","Unlike a pressed or blown-glass part, which traditionally has smooth internal surface features, a printed part can have complex surface features on the inside as well as the outside.","The most beautiful products or the most elegant or seductive products, in my mind, are those that tell a story of a process.","How can we reinterpret 3-D printing in a way that suggests a new design language?","I grew up in a modernist house, in a modernist culture. There was a love for modernism everywhere - the furniture, the books, the food, even the cutlery. So I learned very early to appreciate the value of design and the value of architecture.","There is a very beautiful expression in the Hebrew language that's borrowed from spoken Torah... 'All is predicted, and permission is given at any point to change anything.' I think I live by this idiom in the sense that there is always a goal; there is always something to look forward to in life and my creative search, and that goal is there.","The world of design has been subjugated by the rigors of manufacturing and mass production.","The future of design is a future where anything material in the environment - whether it's wearables, cars, buildings - can be designed with this variation of properties and relationship with the environment that can take part in the natural ecology.","Nature is a brilliant engineer and builder. It knows how to create seashells that are twice as strong as the most resistant ceramics human beings can manufacture, and it produces silk fibers five times stronger than steel. Nature also knows how to create multipurpose forms.","Forms in nature are a byproduct of a reciprocal action between a given material and the conditions of the environment. But in architecture, the process is the direct opposite: First you decide on the form, and then you think how to build it in reality.","I object to the hegemony of form in contemporary architecture. We have very advanced technological tools, but ultimately, we create buildings exactly like we used to before: We send the drawings to an engineer and let him struggle with figuring out how to build it.","Rarely do we see immediate use of innovative technologies. I believe that the future is built by small pieces that add up."],"Nerlens Noel":["I think I'm mostly looking forward to the college life. I'm looking forward to more freedom. Here everything is really structured and scheduled, but in college you've got to be more responsible and you can get things done on your own time. I'm really looking forward to that.","Anyone who knows me knows my mom, Dorcina, has to sign off on any decision and that she will play a major part in any decision.","I look at Syracuse and I love the way that the coaches say they'll use me in their offense. I really like the family atmosphere there and I feel really comfortable there.","Then you've got Georgetown, and I really just like everything about them. When I went down there with my mom, it really opened my eyes to what they were all about. I have to factor in what a school like that can do for me, even away from being a basketball player.","By now everyone knows that I picked Kentucky, and I am definitely happy with my decision and that it's all finally over.","My goals for next year are to win a national title first and foremost.","Then I want to beat Anthony Davis' shot-block record, and I want to win National Player of the Year. I definitely plan to put the work in to accomplish those goals.","It's just a great school and they have a history of developing big men. Georgetown is definitely a great option for me."],"Nestor Carbonell":["Before it was revealed that my character on 'Lost' had a troubled history, a fan came up to me and said, 'Wow, you're a really nice guy.' To me, that was a compliment, having played a very villainous guy.","I was born in New York, but I'm of Cuban heritage. Maybe there's a little island in my blood.","For me, it's always about what's on the page. I have tremendous respect for writing. When you recognize good writing, and you're lucky enough to get it, like with 'Lost,' that's what I follow.","I remember, working on 'Lost,' I learned very quickly the way that I had to approach the material or even ask the director questions. It was always prefaced with, 'Would it be wrong for me to assume?' Because I didn't know where my character on 'Lost' was going.","Those scenes on the beach on 'Lost' were so much fun. When it was a whole group scene, you'd just pop in with a line here and a line there, and there was a little activity, and you essentially spend the day with your friends on the beach. What an amazing working environment.","It's tricky to do a serialized show and not lose viewers along the way because you really have to watch every episode.","Over the years, TV has gotten so much better, especially with the advent of cable. The bar has been raised. I think HBO really set the standard with 'The Sopranos,' and then on mainstream TV, shows like 'Lost' broke amazing ground.","There was only one elective at my college for acting, but thank God for that elective because we had a great teacher who introduced me to the Meisner technique for acting. Once I read that book, I said, 'Wow, if I could do that and have that honest moment on stage, that would be amazing.'"],"Nestor Chylak":["The way I see it, an umpire must be perfect on the first day of the season and then get better every day.","I umpired for 25 years and can honestly say I never called one wrong in my heart."],"Nestor Kirchner":["We must create a kind of globalization that works for everyone... and not just for a few.","I want to rid the country of corruption and return our economic environment.","An agreement cannot be the result of an imposition.","I am honest and want to hear what the people have to say. I do not want to enrich myself in this job.","We will learn together how to solve the problems of the country.","We ask from the heart that supermarkets, which are now more profitable and selling more, help us to take care of the pocketbook of the people by not raising prices."],"Nev Schulman":["Life experience is what defines our character, even if it means getting your heart broken or being lied to. You know, you need the downs to appreciate the ups. Going on the adventure or taking that risk is important.","People really are looking for this perfect sort of dream person, but it's hard to go out every night or make the effort to meet people in your hometown, if you haven't already met them all. Online there's this infinite possibility of meeting this person who, no matter where they live, you're meant to be with.","The idea of finding your soul mate, whether it's online or not, is what people want.","I have very little experience with dating websites. My feeling toward dating websites is what most people's is: If it works, great. If you're serious and legitimate about it and know what you're looking for, then from what I hear, it's definitely effective.","Online, you're providing each other with the good aspects of being together as far as communication and support, but you don't have to deal with the realities of paying bills together, or being annoyed when they leave the toilet seat up or don't put the food away in the fridge.","I've never done it, but I think if you do a Google search for 'People who will help me travel across the country to meet my online love,' I'm probably the only person that comes up.","If we don't hope, if we don't stay positive - at least about love, or finding love - then the rest of life becomes really just painful to think about, because for the most part, you know, day-to-day stuff is monotonous.","If you want proof that 'Catfish' was real, just put me in an audition room and watch me fall apart. I can't pretend. I'm really bad at it. That's partly what makes me good at hosting a reality show.","I support any means to make real connections so long as that it does lead really quickly to real connections. It's the long-term online friendships and relationships that start to get a little hairy."],"Neve Campbell":["Dance is certainly a sport, and they are phenomenal athletes, and they're also artists.","Dance is very, very old. With Louis XIV at Versailles is where ballet started.","Scream was great for what it was. For a horror film, it was intelligent, it was funny, it took a laugh at itself.","I love New York. I love the multicultural vibe here. Los Angeles doesn't inspire me in any way. Everyone is in the same industry, yet you feel very isolated.","You're being cast for your acting ability. It's not based on the way your body functions. If you're playing a lead in a movie, it's for that character and they'll tailor it to you. In a dance company, you have to fit in a definite mold.","There are very few dance companies in the world and you have to be phenomenal. You have to not be injured. You have to have a really strong mind to deal with the dance world. People who can do it are amazing to me. You cannot have a life outside of dance.","I'm just one of those people that if I sit down to watch a horror film, I put my hands over my face and I cry a lot and I don't see half of the film because I'm too upset.","Ballet is completely unnatural to the body, just being turned-out... it's not the way your body is supposed to function, so you actually train your body to be a different structure than you were born with.","I find the most interesting and most daring scripts tend to be for independent films.","I've never been opposed to nudity. I've been opposed to nudity for box-office draw.","If you're in a company, you're dancing from 9 a.m. till 7 in the evening, and then you go home and get in a hot tub and get some Epsom salts and try to get your body goin' again. There's no social life, no anything.","It's almost better most times to not talk in a scene. I think you can actually express a lot more without words.","No matter what your choices are, you truly have no control about what people think of you.","Party of Five won a Golden Globe, it was a well-written television series.","People either know Alan Rudolph and love every single one of his films or they don't know him at all.","The first time I ever screamed at someone was in a scene, and I'd never screamed at someone in my life.","There's a feeling of elation that comes after getting off stage and then there's a feeling of utter sadness that comes after getting off the stage.","There's something really nice about not sitting separate from the crew in some massive trailer away from the studio. To actually be there with them, it's more of a creative process.","I don't know how people can live without a therapist.","My issue in the past with nudity was that these scenes had been written solely for box office draw.","I always thought I should base how good I am on how good I feel I am."],"Neve McIntosh":["In Edinburgh, there was a lovely little Episcopalian Church of Scotland church on my way to the theater, so I used to pop in there and soak up the atmosphere.","I started horse-riding when I was a child and still try to go as often as I can.","In the Church of Scotland, Episcopalian, you don't have to believe in Heaven, but you definitely have to believe in Hell.","Audiences are a wee bit more chatty in New York than in London.","I've been a 'Doctor Who' fan since I was a wee girl.","You go for an audition, and you meet a director, and you find that they don't want you. You have to have a pull with them: that they understand what you want to bring to it. That you don't want to be the pretty little thing.","It's hard to get the downtrodden working-class wifey sometimes because 'You don't look like it'. Well, that's weird because I grew up on a scheme in Paisley. But everyone's got a viewpoint about what you should look like, and it's tainted by prejudices and assumptions.","For a little while there, I was thinking, 'I don't want to be in anything on British TV'. I didn't watch any of it because it was rubbish.","I do worry because it takes all types to make our culture, to make our art. We need it to be available to all.","I really admire medical people. They have a great sense of humour, and they just have to get on with it.","Conflict is always more interesting to play. Not everyone gets along in the trauma unit. In a hard-pressed job like this, there will always be friction.","With some writers, the script looks beautiful on the page, but nobody actually speaks like that.","Some people have a persona that they bring, and I can't do that. It's just me that you get, I'm afraid.","Women are never the protagonists; we're always reactionary against everything that's done to us. I like people who write for women that have got a bit more about them.","My first-night jitters are so bad, I can't even hold a tea cup, but once I am over that, I get really into it.","I haven't done any 'Fringe' shows since I was about 17. Then I performed with my youth theatre in a show where we all had this old-fashioned make-up on and giggled through our lines.","Thankfully, I have never experienced a miscarriage, but I have friends and family who have, and I've talked to them about their feelings.","I tend to do yoga before I go on stage, so that keeps me nice and calm.","I am such a tomboy. I grew up fighting with boys, mainly - beating up boys, actually.","Fashion isn't something I madly follow. I tend just to wear what I like and what fits me well.","I love being in London, where I live, for the shops, the bars and the clubs - but I equally enjoy going to my mum's house in Ayrshire and being able to sit on a cliff by the sea.","I used to have a lovely wallet with lots of different compartments where I kept photographs of my grandmother, grandfather and friends. It was stolen one night when I was out in Edinburgh, and I never got it back.","I love playing 'Madame Vastra.' Although I do suffer, spending three-and-a-half hours in make-up every morning to have her lizard skin put on. I was so excited the first day when we did the make-up test, but after six hours, I was like, 'Can we finish now?'","I can't wait to work with Peter Capaldi as the next 'Doctor.' I know him from old; he's such a lovely man and will be brilliant in the role. As long as he tones down the Malcolm Tucker swearing."],"Nevil Shute":["After two wars, I have been in danger too often to bother very much about being killed, and when it comes, I would prefer that it should happen in an aeroplane, since aeroplanes have been the best part of my life.","It's no good going on living in the ashes of a dead happiness.","Aircraft do not crash of themselves. They come to grief because men are foolish, or vain, or lazy, or irresolute or reckless. One crash in a thousand may be unavoidable because God wills it so - not more than that.","When I was first sent from H.M.S. King Alfred to be interviewed by Goodeve in the Admiralty, I was furious. The War seemed to me, in June of 1940, to be desperately serious, and England in imminent peril of invasion.","Everybody pays lip service to the safety of the aeroplane, but nobody is prepared to pay for it."],"Neville Chamberlain":["I believe it is peace in our time.","In war, whichever side may call itself the victor, there are no winners, but all are losers.","How horrible, fantastic, incredible, it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing.","We should seek by all means in our power to avoid war, by analysing possible causes, by trying to remove them, by discussion in a spirit of collaboration and good will.","However much we may sympathize with a small nation confronted by a big and powerful neighbours, we cannot in all circumstances undertake to involve the whole British Empire in a war simply on her account.","We would fight not for the political future of a distant city, rather for principles whose destruction would ruin the possibility of peace and security for the peoples of the earth."],"Neville Marriner":["I think we were all frustrated with our daily routine.","So in one leap we had gone from being a friendly society to something almost professional.","We don't want other people poking into our artistic pie.","As you know, there are certain languages that lend themselves very easily to vocal use.","Before, we may have taken part in it without even thinking it was American Jewish, but in this case, I think, you have now perhaps pointed us in a direction of a new interest in this repertoire.","But the most important test is to take them on tour and see if you can bear to spend time with them.","I think the quality of something like the Beveridge, for instance, will have a life of its own.","I would like new people with new ideas to come into it and change it.","If the (British) Arts Council give you money, they also tell you how to spend it.","If we perform the romantic repertoire we need more musicians.","Initially we performed in halls with capacities of 1,000.","Most Beethoven symphonies require 80 or more instruments, and the late romantics even more.","Mozart has written opera, symphony, sacred and chamber music - not to mention his piano and violin concerti.","Music is a continuum and the modern and avant-garde composers of today will be part of the standard repertoire 30 years from now.","One of the great virtues, apart from the pleasure of performing these works, is that it's opened up an entirely new, expansive repertoire of American Jewish music.","One thing we were looking for from the start was players who really fit together, who sounded in tune.","So I think we got together as the Academy to give ourselves that sort of responsibility and to play well.","So I've never found there was any particular separation between the two cultures at all, musically speaking.","Taste is changing, style is changing, and players' abilities are changing.","The awful thing about a conductor becoming geriatric is that you seem to become more desirable, not less.","There are some sounds that English singers find quite difficult to manipulate.","This American Jewish music is a new experience for us at least consciously."],"Newt Gingrich":["Perseverance is the hard work you do after you get tired of doing the hard work you already did.","I will continue to find ways to help poor people find a job, get a job, and learn someday to own the job.","I don't know of a single economist who disagrees that when you raise the minimum wage, you kill jobs for the poor.","More than just a zoo, the Animal Kingdom is an extraordinary experience of animals, rides and performances. The exhibits have the scale and creativity you associate with Disney. The African safari ride is terrific and worth riding several times.","If you get involved in a controversy, then that becomes the mesmerizing event that people remember you by.","Both sides in Syria are bad. One side is a brutal dictator, and the other includes Islamists and terrorists who are dangerous already and who would be brutal in power if given the chance.","This is about systemic, institutional corruption, not personality. To ask the Democratic leadership to clean things up would be like asking the old Soviet bureaucracy under Brezhnev to reform itself. It ain't going to happen.","My style is to stay on the offensive: to take risks, to recover very fast when you make a mistake, but to keep moving forward.","The most important social welfare program in America is a job.","If you're not brave, you're not going to be free.","Think about it. If it's taking pictures, it's not a cellphone. If it has a McDonald's app to tell you where McDonald's is based on your GPS location, that's not a cellphone. If you can get Wikipedia or go to Google, that's not a cellphone.","I think you can write a psychological profile of me that says I found a way to immerse my insecurities in a cause large enough to justify whatever I wanted it to.","If you live your life as a hostage to everybody else's decision, you either have to live a very narrow life, or you have to spend a lot of time in pain.","By definition, the person who learns enough to become the nominee is almost certainly the best person for the general election.","Until someone is prepared to lay out the systemic problem, we will simply go through cycles of finding corruption, finding a scapegoat, eliminating the scapegoat, and relaxing until we find the next scandal.","Is the purpose of free elections to allow the most clever and vicious person to aggregate power, or is the purpose of free elections to enable the American people to have a serious conversation about their country's future and try to find both a policy and a personality that they think will carry to them that better future?","I think one of the great problems we have in the Republican Party is that we don't encourage you to be nasty. We encourage you to be neat, obedient, loyal and faithful and all those Boy Scout words, which would be great around a campfire but are lousy in politics.","The Central Park Zoo is a little gem in the middle of the city. Its penguin exhibit is terrific, and the seals are a permanent center of attraction for children.","The genius of guys like Lincoln and Reagan and FDR - the great communicator leaders - is that they're actually educators, so they understand when they use a phrase that they have to explain it, because, by definition, you won't understand it or they wouldn't need to be using it.","We need a visionary leader with very big and bold ideas. This is a very big, very bold country.","Nazis don't have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust museum in Washington.","I would replace most foreign aid with a tax credit for businesses to invest. I think U.S. bureaucrats giving foreign bureaucrats money is a guaranteed failure. And we've had about 50 years' experience at failing with foreign aid.","The idea that a congressman would be tainted by accepting money from private industry or private sources is essentially a socialist argument.","I was once, I think, bitten on the nose by a lion cub.","I discourage a cult of personality.","If the Soviet empire still existed, I'd be terrified. The fact is, we can afford a fairly ignorant presidency now.","If you take all the money we've spent at NASA since we landed on the moon and you had applied that money for incentives to the private sector, we would today probably have a permanent station on the moon, three or four permanent stations in space, a new generation of lift vehicles.","I've been very clear publicly I'm not a perfect human being, and I've made mistakes in my life, and I've had to apologize to God and to seek reconciliation.","The fact is inner-city black districts are not the same as suburban Republican districts. That's a fact. And people need to go and learn about the whole country.","We tried to have diplomas without learning, we tried to have jobs without work, we tried to have houses without savings, we tried to have government without responsibility.","It is time we passed a balanced budget amendment and return this government to limited spending.","You have to give the press confrontations. When you give them confrontations, you get attention; when you get attention, you can educate.","We're all human and we all goof. Do things that may be wrong, but do something.","I think the destructive, vicious, negative nature of much of the news media makes it harder to govern this country, harder to attract decent people to run for public office.","Congress was designed by the Founding Fathers to move slowly, precisely to avoid the sudden panic of a one-week solution that becomes a 20-year mess.","I am for deporting all recent unattached illegals. I am for a local citizen panel to consider certification of those who have been here 25 years and have family and community and have been law-abiding and tax-paying.","Somehow we must reintegrate the scientific with the popular and reconnect the future to the present. This is less a job for scientists, engineers, bureaucrats, and administrators and more a job for novelists, moviemakers, popularizers, and politicians.","This is a candidate who never even thought about policy. What Trump represents is pure willpower and the notion of breaking through the system.","You have a very poor neighborhood. You have students that are required to go to school. They have no money, no habit of work. What if you paid them in the afternoon to work in the clerical office or as the assistant librarian?","If, as the popular saying goes, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, the people who run our public schools fit that description.","You can't trust anybody with power.","We don't we agree that litigation reform to lower the cost of healthcare would be a good starting point?","A mere forty years ago, beach volleyball was just beginning. No bureaucrat would have invented it, and that's what freedom is all about.","In every election in American history both parties have their cliches. The party that has the cliches that ring true wins.","What is the primary purpose of a political leader? To build a majority. If voters care about parking lots, then talk about parking lots.","Politics and war are remarkably similar situations.","I'm not a natural leader. I'm too intellectual; I'm too abstract; I think too much.","One morning, just like 9/11, there's going to be a disaster. I have yet to see the United Nations do anything effective with either Iran or North Korea.","An energy tax punishes senior citizens, it punishes rural Americans, if you use electricity it punishes you. This bill will increase your cost of living and may kill your job.","Imagine a judicial nominee said 'my experience as a white man makes me better than a Latina woman.' Wouldn't they have to withdraw? New racism is no better than old racism.","Frankly, Governor Romney in his career has created more jobs than the entire Obama cabinet combined, so he could actually talk about it.","President Obama has created at least three jobs that I know of - Bob McDonnell, Chris Christie, and Scott Brown.","Without Jimmy Carter we might not have gotten Ronald Reagan, without Ronald Reagan there would probably still be a Soviet Union.","I believe we are now in a struggle over whether or not we are going to save America.","Part of why the Tea Party so deeply threatened the elite media is the tea party looked around and suddenly realized, there are more of us than there are of them.","Have you heard a single national figure tell you all of the crises of the recent past are not economic, they're cultural?","In the middle of a recession no tax increase is justified because it kills jobs, and any tax increase is a job-killing measure and should be defeated.","The time has come to tell the truth about the corruption of the government employee unions in this country.","I believe we will elect a new President in 2012.","Surely the President can agree with us, that theft from government is not good. I know it's bold. It's out on the edge. I know from a Chicago-Springfield background it's hard to fully grasp that honesty could be part of government.","And my point was one I think that you'd agree with, which is there's no room in America for a black racist, a Latino racist, or a white racist, or an Asian racist, or a Native American racist. Now, we're either color blind or we're not color blind.","If the Obama administration is this afraid of Glenn Beck, how do they deal with the Iranians?","The secular elites are so terrified of telling the truth about radical Islam. When you talk about the radical Islamists, we have got to get straight and get serious and talk about it in the right way.","I think every religious person should have a deep sense of respect for other people's religious documents and religious symbols just as we were deeply opposed to the Taliban destroying the two historic buddhas which they blew up. So I think we ought to all oppose burning the Koran.","My theme is going to be: Together we can win the future. The right policies lead to the right results. And I'm going to argue that President Obama will lose the future because the wrong policies lead to the wrong results.","We're at the crossroads. Down one road is a European centralized bureaucratic socialist welfare system in which politicians and bureaucrats define the future. Down the other road is a proud, solid, reaffirmation of American exceptionalism.","President Obama is the most successful food stamp president in American history. I would like to be the most successful paycheck president in American history.","I'm going to be the nominee. It's very hard not to look at the recent polls and think that the odds are very high I'm going to be the nominee.","And by the way I don't object if people want to attack me, that's their right. All I'm suggesting that it's not going to be very effective and that people are going to get sick of it very fast. And the guys who attacked each other in the debates up to now, every single one of them have lost ground by attacking.","I will focus on being substantive and I will focus on Barack Obama.","The bigotry question goes both ways. There's a lot more anti-Christian bigotry today than there is concerning the other side. None of it gets covered by the news media.","Should the Catholic Church find itself discriminated against by the Obama administration on key delivery of services because of the bias and the bigotry of the administration?","All unemployment compensation should be tied to a job training requirement. Now the fact is, 99 weeks is an associate degree.","Only the elites despise earning money.","Now, I know among the politically correct, you're not supposed to use facts that are uncomfortable.","I don't see how the party that says it's the party of the family is going to adopt an immigration policy which destroys families that have been here a quarter century.","I think to close half of Magic Kingdom for the purpose of a White House invitation town hall meeting on a phony main street on behalf of a phony president just strikes me as weird.","You know, modern liberals are just, I think frankly, totally off the deep end... their only answer is to yell racism and hide.","So I'd be quite happy to have a three-hour Lincoln-Douglas-style debate with Barack Obama. I'd let him use a teleprompter. I'll just rely on knowledge. We'll do fine.","There I was on the front page of the 'London Times' as speaker of the House with an animal on top of my head. I liked it, but it was not what my staff thought was appropriately dignified.","What makes me unusually intense is that I personalize the pain of war, the pain of children being killed, the pain of a 16-year-old who has been permanently cheated by his school and cannot read.","I have an enormous personal ambition. I want to shift the entire planet.","It's been one of the most painful things I've ever been through in my whole life: trying to understand the degree to which behaviors that I thought were totally appropriate were destructive.","Nixon had this remarkably effective, deeply intense will to power. Reagan and I have a will to ideas.","I joined a Republican Party that was used to losing, used to being browbeaten by the Democrats. I represent a totally different style.","Whether it's his beloved game of polo or his magical success in business, Norman Brinker simply does not know how to lose.","You can either be in the Ron Paul tradition and say there's nothing wrong with heroin and cocaine, or you can be in the tradition that says, 'These kind of addictive drugs are terrible; they deprive you of full citizenship, and they lead you to a dependency which is antithetical to being an American.'","I can tell you I can work on four or five hours of sleep a night and cat nap all day, and I can go for 8 or 10 days on the road, and it doesn't seem to affect me.","I think my health is probably fine. Let's be honest, you never know what could happen to somebody, but I think I'm in very good shape right now.","You can never study Franklin Delano Roosevelt too much.","Cincinnati has one of the most diverse animal collections in the world, with more than 500 species represented. They also have a really good insect exhibit.","Why not aspire to build a real Jurassic Park?","The one period of glory in NASA was the first nine years when they weren't a bureaucracy yet... and they haven't gotten back to that excitement, that adventurism, and won't. So, I would take most of the NASA budget, and I would turn it into prizes for private sector.","Whether you're talking about Chris Christie, or you're talking about Rick Perry or Scott Walker or John Kasich, there's more interesting evolution at the state level than there is in Washington.","You talk about crying! The spring of 1988, I spent a fair length of time trying to come to grips with who I was and the habits I had and what they did to people that I truly loved.

This is no longer the primaries. He's no longer an interesting contender. He is now the potential leader of the United States and he's got to move his game up to the level of being a potential leader.","If Trump keeps learning, he could become a big asset. He will shatter the traditional patterns.","When you come to America, you get to become an American, and Trump, who has grandparents who came to the U.S., should understand this as much as anybody.","We have to be as militant defending America as the enemies of America are in trying to destroy America.","Trump would represent turmoil - unless he changed, unless he said, 'Now that I got to be president, I'm gonna be normal.'","The government shut down 12 times under Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill. It was only shut down twice while I was speaker.","The courts have become grotesquely dictatorial and far too powerful.","While abolishing judgeships and lower federal courts is a blunt tool and one whose use is warranted only in the most extreme of circumstances... it is one of many possibilities to check and balance the judiciary.","The Constitution of the United States has absolutely nothing to say about a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.

When we tried that in Vietnam, they beat us up.","If we are all endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness, that has to apply to the poorest neighborhoods in the poorest counties, and I am prepared to find something that works, that breaks us out of the cycles we have now to find a way for poor children to work and earn honest money.","I pray before virtually every speech and virtually every major decision.","I believe most evangelicals know that defeating Obama is at heart of our country's future.","I think what you'll find is overall, overwhelmingly, evangelicals would prefer me to Barack Obama.","The values of the Left cripple human beings, weaken cities, make it difficult for us to in fact survive as a country.","Islamic extremism may well be the greatest threat to Western values and Western security in the world.","The thing that shocks people... is that I mean what I say. I don't use hyperbole.","One of my messages to Republicans is very simple: One-third of your schedule should be listening to people in minority communities.","There is no question that at times in my life, partially driven by how passionately I felt about my country, that I worked far too hard and that things happened in my life that were not appropriate.","I clearly have done things that were wrong. I've clearly had to seek God's forgiveness.","NASA should not be developing its own proprietary version of capabilities it could purchase commercially at much lower cost, especially when we know the agency's bureaucratic tendencies will be to view the commercial versions as competitors to kill.","Philosophically, I am very different from normal politicians, and normal consultants found that very hard to deal with.","We have big ideas. I just think that's part of how you campaign. You talk to the American people about big things.","If I had to choose Reaganomics or 13 staffers quitting, I think for the average working American, Reaganomics was a much better deal.","I have a sense of being at peace. I understand when you give the sign of peace, and when the priest says, 'Peace be with you,' in a way I never did 10 or 15 years ago. I have a deep personal sense of what that means.","People have to render judgment. In my case, I've said upfront openly, I've made mistakes at times. I've had to go to God for forgiveness. I've had to seek reconciliation. But I'm also a 68-year-old grandfather, and I think people have to measure who I am now and whether I'm a person they can trust.","I would just say, if Gov. Romney wants to give back all the money he's earned from bankrupting companies and laying off employees over his years at Bain, that I would be glad to listen to him.

There's no one else who can say what I can say.

I play football to be happy, because I love it and want to play football.","It's good for Brazilian football to have idols, stars, big stars coming back to Brazilian clubs. The tournaments become much better, more interesting. Ze Roberto, Juninho Pernambucano, Ronaldinho Gaucho, and other players who have returned to Brazil strengthen the league and improve the tournaments.","Above all, I want to be happy, and at Barcelona, I'm happy.","I've always said I learned to defend myself from an opponent coming for a hard hit. Tricks are part of my repertoire; I use them to try to get past my opponents, but the objective is always to score goals.","When I'm on the field, the trick I like to do most are stepovers. For me, it's a simple, beautiful dribble that also has a point.","I must follow my heart.","What I think about is my happiness, together with my family. I want us to be happy.","Winning titles plays a big role in the Ballon d'Or race.","I don't want to surpass Messi.","It is easier when you like to work with your companions.","When we lose, we don't have to change everything but correct things by working hard.","I just want to be better every day, to get better every day, not to be better than anyone else.","It is difficult to take in that your idols are in the same place as you are.","When we're on vacation - it doesn't matter where - I will go and look for a game.","My opinion is that protesting, there's no problem with it, as long as it is peaceful without violence, without vandalism.","My father always told me I like the ball more than I like playing soccer: since I was a young kid, I was always skilled with it, dribbling furniture around the house. That's how I see football - fun and dynamic - and this goes beyond me; it's a characteristic of Brazilian football.","I always dribble for a reason, and I always head for the goal.","I respect his decisions, but football without Messi is not football. It is very hard to imagine football without him.","I know that it is a huge responsibility to be the captain, the No. 10, but I like it. I like the responsibility, the pressure, and I like playing football.","I was quite nervous in my first week at Barcelona, but after that, I was relaxed.","I was at a great club at Barcelona. I loved Barcelona.","I've learned my tricks watching videos on the Internet with friends. I'm always trying to copy what I've seen at home, what I learned from my friends. But you have to repeat it again and again to get it right on the field.","Of course Messi could handle a cold Tuesday night in Stoke. He'd be drinking tea and relaxing beforehand. Me? I'd probably be the same.","It doesn't matter who scores the goals, just that we win the games.","I don't mind being the one people talk about. It doesn't weigh on me.","I will be a World Cup winner.","In the Premier League, you never know who is going to win or who will be champions. It is always a surprise.","I have always kept in mind the advice of Ronaldinho, and he spoke wonders of Barcelona and the city, which he told me is marvellous.","Football, particularly Brazilian football, is about being happy, and that's what tricks do. It's part of our culture, at the end of the day, though, it's all about winning.","I'm not scared. I always go forward, trying to create space and make my way toward the goal.","Football without Messi and Messi without football are not things that go together.","I'm a happy guy. I like to joke around. I'm irreverent. I love my family; I love my son. I was very happy with and proud of the birth of my son. I grew up a lot after he was born. I'm just an easy and happy guy.","I've always had the greatest respect for and listened to both my father and my mother. I've always tried to follow my parents' advice because these are people who want the best for me.","My father has been by my side since I was little. He takes care of things, my finances and my family.","I admire Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool - these are the teams that are always there fighting.","I try to be myself without being anything different.","I believe Philippe Coutinho is a player who would totally fit in Barcelona.","I prefer beating Real Madrid to beating Manchester City!","To play with the best is very easy.","My dad just wants me to dedicate myself to playing and to focus on the ball.","I'm Messi Football Club.","Cristiano Ronaldo has created his own story, and now I'm creating mine.","I'm always learning. I have to.","I was never motivated by money.","Right now I'm living my boyhood dream, which was to play for a European club. The fact that it's a huge club like Barcelona makes it a tremendous honour. I like everything about the city: the climate, the people. It's quite similar to Brazil, which helps a lot. There's even a beach!","Every team going to Brazil 2014 will be there to win, and it's going to be a fiercely contested World Cup.","I can't be compared to Pele. I need to do so much more to be compared to Pele. Pele is fantastic. And he's unique.","It was a huge thrill to win the Confederations Cup.","The Premier League is a championship that amazes me. I like the playing style and the teams.","Benzema is a great striker who I think is a superstar.","Not only the attackers, but the defenders - it's on the attackers to prepare themselves to break through the strong defense.","You need a lot of comfort and nothing to be on your weight to play as you wish.","I never run away from the responsibility. I'm used to it.","I don't compare tournaments.","I just like winning every tournament that I play. All of them are important for me. Each has its own history, its own characteristic, but they are all important.","I do not like to put one title above the other. Every competition I contest and win is important.","Every team has a person who is used as a reference, a player who stands out more than others.","One that I like and I think could play here is Coutinho. He has the style of Barcelona.","I want to trace my own path by doing the things I have been doing, winning titles, reaching goals.","I don't want to surpass anyone. I don't want to be better than anyone else.","I only want to be the best that I can be.","The first game is always the most difficult, for the nerves you have before you begin to play.","I don't know how many great Brazilians have played in the Olympics and not been able to win it.","I don't like to talk about myself.","I try to be a good role model for my son, my family, my friends, and then I try to be a good role model for the rest of the people, too.","I'm only one Neymar - for my family, for the public. I'm always the same person.","I'm very happy that major players are always giving their opinions about my life, my game. I am very thankful for that.","I always make my decisions together with my family, my father. Of course, I hear the advice of everyone who wishes me well, but the final decision is always mine, with my family.","I always do as my heart tells me.","You always knows what's best for you.","I play to be happy in the first place and then to help my colleagues and my team the best way I can, with the best football.","That is one of the things I dream about for myself: to receive the 'golden ball' someday.","I believe the Champions League has all that magic because it gathers all the best European teams, and that gives you the feeling of trying to be the best. That's why the Champions League has this special kind of emotion.","I don't feel hatred for Zuniga.","A historic defeat cannot bow our heads forever.","I can't protect myself when I'm not facing the play.","The only thing that can protect me from someone coming from behind are the rules.","Messi is a great player. Playing against him is not good - it is bad.","I am not the type of person who lets the pressure get to him. I try to see it as my friend. I align with it to calm me down.","Unfortunately, I never saw Pele play. What I know of him is through my grandfather, my dad's dad, who used to talk to me and tell me about how he played.","The Libertadores is sensational, but the Champions League... The first time I heard the anthem was a really special feeling. It's like being in a video game; it's living the dream of every child.","I'm always happy, in every game, every win I keep writing my history, and I hope to do even more from now on.","I just like playing with the ball. I always have.","Everything in my life has happened very early, personally and professionally.","I'm 69 kilos; I don't have a burden on my back.","I think every player should be allowed to stay or leave a club.","I started playing football in a school back in Sao Vicente when I was five years old, going towards six. Those were my first steps, among those kids, and then I kept going.","The fact I am the most expensive player is not a burden.","I am proud of every one of my teammates.","Our objective is always to win. Every day, every game, and every competition.","I never like to say that I'm better than anybody else.","When I arrived at Barcelona and saw Messi's face, and later Luis Suarez, I felt like it was a videogame.","Whoever likes football always likes to see the best player on the pitch.","When you see a person you love being affected, suffering, people saying things that aren't true... then it hurts you.","Before speaking without knowledge, saying lies, you have to present evidence.","Romario had the best first touch and the best pass to score a goal.","Messi has the best technique in the world.","Of course, it is my goal to win the Ballon d'Or, but I am not going to kill myself for it.","It is not a problem if I do not win the Ballon d'Or.","Winning the Ballon d'Or is the consequence of your work.","My first pair of Jordans, I wore them all the time. I would wear them to school; I always had them on.","There weren't many options growing up, so I would wear whatever possible. I once saw a little boy wearing Jordan sneakers in a movie... and that made me dream.","The moment I am off the field, it's my personal time.","I like to go out and have fun with my friends. I have family, too, so why can't I go out to clubs? I can, and I will.","Imagine you're 24 years old, earning what I earn and having all that I have. Wouldn't you be the same as me?"],"Ngaio Marsh":["I always, by an involuntary act of defensiveness, return to my everyday self: so, I find, have I withdrawn from writing about experiences which have most closely concerned and disturbed me. I have been deflected by my own reticence.","I acquired quite a lot of technical skill and got quite a long way with my painting, but I never felt I was doing what New Zealand was about with my paint.","If you don't write about what you know, you're like a barrister and have to do a frightful amount of research for each case.","What does 'Ngaio' mean? I don't know. Like many Maori words, it has a number of meanings - clever, light on the water, a little bug - but I don't know which my parents had in mind.","Had I guessed the trouble my name was going to cause a lot of people on the other side of the world, I would have changed it to something easier when I began writing books.","I always make a point of keeping the most pleasant-sounding name for the murderer.

I'm a fighter; I'm very focused on what I'm doing, and relentless in what I want to achieve, almost to a fault. If you get in my way, you get kicked.","When it comes to doing my job, I keep my ego in my handbag.","No one can fight corruption for Nigerians except Nigerians. Everyone has to be committed from the top to the bottom to fight it.","If we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria, it means they can form the base of production for our economy.","I can take hardship. I can sleep on the cold floor anytime. I can also sleep on a feather bed.","I felt Nigeria didn't have to succumb to the image of being a corrupt country; we didn't have to let the economy stagnate.","One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian, and it has 140 million dynamic people - chaotic people - but very interesting people.","Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well. So what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule that de-linked our budget from the oil price.","I'm trying to tell you that there's a new wave on the continent. A new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000, more than two-thirds of African countries have had multi-party democratic elections. Not all of them have been perfect, or will be, but the trend is very clear.","The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid. It is all the resources that were taken from Africa, including human, that built these countries today! So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.","From 1967 to '70, Nigeria fought a war - the Nigeria-Biafra war. And in the middle of that war, I was 14 years old. We spent much of our time with my mother cooking. For the army - my father joined the army as a brigadier - the Biafran army. We were on the Biafran side.","I believe that when you find problems, you should also find solutions.","Educating our young girls is the foundation for Nigeria's growth and development.","Women account for about 70% of Africa's food production and manage a large proportion of small enterprises. They are also increasingly represented in legislative and executive leadership positions.","My parents lost everything, all their savings, because we had to run from the Nigerian side to the Biafran side. We were Igbos.","I know what it means to go to the stream to fetch water... what it means when people are poor and don't have enough to eat. It's not enough to say you know about poverty.

But I think he was gentler than me."],"Nguyen Cao Ky":["If the war has faded into history, democracy's defeat in Vietnam has left deep marks in the consciousness of both nations.","By fighting a limited, defensive war, America permitted the enemy to endlessly re-supply their field armies.","We all know that in war the political and military factors have to complement each other.","Americans are big boys. You can talk them into almost anything. Just sit with them for half an hour over a bottle of whiskey and be a nice guy.","After the 1954 Geneva international conference, Vietnam was divided into two parts. On paper, North and South Vietnam were twin countries born at the same moment.","Through leadership of the fight against French colonialism, Ho Chi Minh had made a name for himself in the international political arena.","During the Fifties, political and military activities in Vietnam were heavily influenced by the French, who as recent colonial masters, made all-important decisions.","From its inception, South Vietnam was only considered to be an outpost in the war against communism.","After Watergate, America was a ship without a rudder. Vietnam was left to its own devices, drifting along towards its fate.","South Vietnam had to be built from scratch and, from the very beginning, depended far too much on the Western superpowers. As in the case of a person on public welfare, this dependency, which became greater with each day, was quite difficult to shake.","By the mid-sixties, the United States had poured more than half a million troops into South Vietnam.","I never staged a coup. They picked me up. Like I say, they forced me to become premier, maybe hoping that by that way, they send me to the electric chair.","If Americans knew how to deal with other people, they could bring peace to the world. Alas, they have not learned enough yet. The true American feels that he is 100 percent welcome anywhere he goes.","The way Americans understand and treat other peoples almost guarantees that the world will suffer more trouble.","I have been blessed often by Buddha, but equally by America.","And then when they picked me as premiere, I don't think I feel, you know, different. For me, the position mean responsibility, but that's all."],"Nguyen Tan Dung":["Corruption is not a problem just for some countries; this is a global issue.","I joined the People's Armed Forces in 1961 to 1984, and I was also a soldier in the southern battle of Vietnam during the resistance against the Americans. I went to the battlefield in order to regain national independence.","When I was in the army, there were four times that I was wounded. I also got more than 30 wounds on my body, and my injuries were ranked on the second rank of invalids. The first rank is the most severe. So, that means that I had lost more than 60 per cent of working capability."],"Nguyen Van Thieu":["Don't listen to what the Communists say, but look at what they do.","The United States did not keep its promise to help us fight for freedom and it was in the same fight that the United States lost 50,000 of its young men.","You ran away and left us to do the job that you could not do.","But the United States did not keep its word.

This is the most basic kind of peace work.","The practice of peace and reconciliation is one of the most vital and artistic of human actions.","The real power of the Buddha was that he had so much love. He saw people trapped in their notions of small separate self, feeling guilty or proud of that self, and he offered revolutionary teachings that resounded like a lion's roar, like a great rising tide, helping people to wake up and break free from the prison of ignorance.","Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.","Mindfulness practices enhance the connection between our body, our mind and everything else that is around us. Mindful living is the key to understanding our struggles with weight and to empowering us to control our weight.","People deal too much with the negative, with what is wrong. Why not try and see positive things, to just touch those things and make them bloom?","True self is non-self, the awareness that the self is made only of non-self elements. There's no separation between self and other, and everything is interconnected.","Science and mindfulness complement each other in helping people to eat well and maintain their health and well-being.","We humans have lost the wisdom of genuinely resting and relaxing.

We don't allow our bodies to heal, and we don't allow our minds and hearts to heal.","With mindfulness, you can establish yourself in the present in order to touch the wonders of life that are available in that moment.","Smiling is very important. If we are not able to smile, then the world will not have peace. It is not by going out for a demonstration against nuclear missiles that we can bring about peace. It is with our capacity of smiling, breathing, and being peace that we can make peace.","Meditation is not to avoid society; it is to look deep to have the kind of insight you need to take action. To think that it is just to sit down and enjoy the calm and peace, is wrong.","Every thought you produce, anything you say, any action you do, it bears your signature.","If you abandon the present moment, you cannot live the moments of your daily life deeply.","You carry Mother Earth within you. She is not outside of you. Mother Earth is not just your environment.","When we recognise the virtues, the talent, the beauty of Mother Earth, something is born in us, some kind of connection; love is born.","To be a monk is to have time to practice for your transformation and healing. And after that to help with the transformation and healing of other people.","If you have the chance to be exposed to a loving, understanding environment where the seed of compassion, loving kindness, can be watered every day, then you become a more loving person.","In true dialogue, both sides are willing to change.","Breathing in, I am aware of my heart. Breathing out, I smile to my heart and know that my heart still functions normally. I feel grateful for my heart.","We really have to understand the person we want to love. If our love is only a will to possess, it is not love. If we only think of ourselves, if we know only our own needs and ignore the needs of the other person, we cannot love.","Mindfulness helps you go home to the present. And every time you go there and recognize a condition of happiness that you have, happiness comes.","We are looking for happiness and running after it in such a way that creates anger, fear and discrimination. So when you attend a retreat, you have a chance to look at the deep roots of this pollution of the collective energy that is unwholesome.","When you have peace in yourself and accept, then you are calm enough to do something, but if you are carried by despair, there is no hope.","Many people are alive but don't touch the miracle of being alive.","We have the tendency to run away from suffering and to look for happiness. But, in fact, if you have not suffered, you have no chance to experience real happiness.","Peace in the world starts with peace in oneself. If everyone lives mindfully, everyone will be more healthy, feel more fulfilled in their daily lives and there will be more peace.","Anyone who is practicing understanding and compassion can exemplify true power. Anyone can be a Buddha.","Love is the capacity to take care, to protect, to nourish.","In order to rally people, governments need enemies... if they do not have a real enemy, they will invent one in order to mobilize us.","When we give ourselves the chance to let go of all our tension, the body's natural capacity to heal itself can begin to work.","If we chew every morsel of our food, in that way we become grateful, and when you are grateful, you are happy.","Fear, separation, hate and anger come from the wrong view that you and the Earth are two separate entities, the Earth is only the environment. You are in the centre, and you want to do something for the Earth in order for you to survive.","When I became a novice monk, I lived in a temple where the atmosphere was quite like in a family. The abbot is like a father and other monks are like your big brothers, your small, younger brothers. It is a kind of family.","I love to sit and eat quietly and enjoy each bite, aware of the presence of my community, aware of all the hard and loving work that has gone into my food.","It's normal for human beings to identify with their own separate self. The problem is that we get caught in that notion of ourself as a separate individual and caught in that individual self's agenda.","Happiness is the cessation of suffering.","Total relaxation is the secret to enjoying sitting meditation. I sit with my spine upright, but not rigid; and I relax all the muscles in my body.","I realize that many elements of the Buddhist teaching can be found in Christianity, Judaism, Islam. I think if Buddhism can help, it is the concrete methods of practice.","There are many levels of Christianity. There are many notions about God. To believe that God is a person is just one of the notions of God that you can find in Christianity. So, we should not say that there is one Christianity. There are many Christianities.","Buddhism teaches us not to try to run away from suffering. You have to confront suffering. You have to look deeply into the nature of suffering in order to recognize its cause, the making of the suffering.","When you have enough understanding and compassion in you, then that amount of understanding and compassion will try to express itself in action. And your practice should help you to cultivate more understanding and compassion.","Mother Earth is very talented. She has produced Buddhas, bodhisattvas, great beings.","The happiest moments are when we sit down and we feel the presence of our brothers and sisters, lay and monastic, who are practicing walking and sitting mediation.","If every day you practice walking and sitting meditation and generate the energy of mindfulness and concentration and peace, you are a cell in the body of the new Buddha. This is not a dream but is possible today and tomorrow.","Nothing can be by itself alone, no one can be by himself or herself alone, everyone has to inter-be with every one else. That is why, when you look outside, around you, you can see yourself.","Usually, people have a tendency to be caught in the worries concerning the future or in the regret concerning the past. There is some kind of energy that is pushing them to run, and they are not able to establish themselves in the present moment.","Doubt in my tradition is something that is very helpful. Because of doubt, you can thirst more and you will get a higher kind of proof.","In Buddhism, we talk of meditation as an act of awakening, to be awake to the fact that the earth is in danger and living species are in danger.","To meditate means to go home to yourself. Then you know how to take care of the things that are happening inside you, and you know how to take care of the things that happen around you.","I think Buddhism should open the door of psychology and healing to penetrate more easily into the Western world.","In Buddhist culture, offering food to the monk symbolizes the action of goodness, and if you have no opportunity to support the practice of spirituality, then you are somehow left in the realm of darkness.","Meditation is to get insight, to get understanding and compassion, and when you have them, you are compelled to act.","People suffer because they are caught in their views. As soon as we release those views, we are free and we don't suffer anymore.","Many of us have been running all our lives. Practice stopping.","Everything we touch in our daily lives, including our body, is a miracle. By putting the kingdom of god in the right place, it shows us it is possible to live happily right here, right now.","One Buddha is not enough; we need to have many Buddhas.","Many Communist government officials have a rigid, dictatorial power, but they live in constant suspicion and fear of anything that might undermine the power they have."],"Nia Long":["I think Nina Simone has had an amazing journey. She was spicy and she had attitude and she didn't care, she wanted her money in a paper bag and don't mess with me and I've been doing some research on that so.","I think you grow through your experiences; you get better as you grow and I'm not nearly where I think I'm going to be eventually where I inspire to be and hopefully the opportunities will continue to come.","They have the big ferris wheel and we've been out of town for two months, so he just was like, 'Mommy I want to go to Toys R Us and I don't care if you have a movie coming out and all that.' He was just being a kid. But I had to allow him to have that moment.","I'm not going to live my life unhappy and why should he and we talk about it and I think what's great about the film is that it shows is the meaning of family doesn't have to be as traditional as it once was, like you can make a family.","You need the words, you need the script, you need the material, you need the commitment, you need the passion, it's like we depend on writers, we depend on producers, directors depend on us and once things are in the divine order as they happen.","I have a four year old and I'm telling you we did Nickelodeon last night and he embarrassed me. It was like one of those moments when I couldn't believe my kid is acting like this. I just had to just like walk away from him because he was really pushing my buttons.","But that we didn't have the level of experience in terms of working in the industry so you weren't sure and you needed to see it and this is an industry that the more you work the better you get and that the more opportunities you have the better you get.","First of all when you're a mommy like you like the consistency of being on a show like that's just peace of mind, I know I have financial, you know stability.","He just was being four. He just was being a child. He wasn't interested in what my agenda was. He wanted to do what he wanted to do and it started because he saw the lights on in Toys R Us.","I don't think you should reprimand your child for everything you're feeling because for them it's as serious as when something happens in our day and we get upset about it.","I have a beautiful son, I don't regret it, I'm very proud of the way that we handle our relationship and the way that we keep our son first and that's our priority.","I know for me like I have a reputation of being kind of tough, I have a reputation of also being the girl next door, kind of sweet but I have standards and my thing is, it's me on that screen and I don't have control over everything in this and I'm grateful and thankful.","I know where I'm going to be, I'm not traveling here and there and everywhere. That didn't necessarily prompt me to it but it definitely opened up my mind of saying okay, maybe this is a good time to do this.","I said 'Brian, no one is going to respect me as a mother after this.' He said, 'oh no, yes they will, this is a movie, don't worry about it.' But they're not.","I think for me to find that project is going to be something that I'm going to have to develop for myself.","I think there are a lot of other actors that are just talented, it's just about this opportunity - it's just about when are we going to be put in those positions where we can shine.","I took a little break - I was coming back to work and the last thing I was going to do was take a step backwards, so I knew that if I was going to take a feature it was going to have to be taking a step forward.","I was happy she got it and I have to sort of - and one of the reasons I did Third Watch is because I wanted to break that thing of just being the pretty girl and play it down and let it be about the work.","I've seen some great write ups and I emailed her the other night because I saw her on an awards show recently.","In terms of Cube I think he's very conscious of the technical aspect of the business whereas when you're just hired as an actor, you're not really secure in that part of your work and you're not really paying attention to where the camera.","It took a long time to get that film made. I went in for it almost right after or like maybe six or seven months after I had my son and actually auditioned for the Regina King part and they just were like, 'No, you're just - you just don't really seem the part.'","It's like going to the gym everyday. It really is. I work hard on my craft, I sweat a little bit, I run a little bit, I might sprain an ankle every now and them, but it's all good and the more you do it, the more in shape you are and it's like a machine.","It's my motor, it's the thing that keeps me going and so when I have these auditions for these big movies, I can depend on myself because I've been working consistently.","We haven't even gotten a start date but we'll see what happens with that and that will be fun. I've gotten a couple of other things but I'm not really committing myself to anything yet.","We're all in the service business. If you hire me to do a job I expect everybody else to be where I am. A little bit of crazy is good. It keeps things - balanced.","Well, the studios don't really want to take those risks right off the bat. They'll take the risk after they've seen the finished product and say oh yeah we want that. This is a great film but they are hesitant to take the risk when you just see it on paper."],"Nia Peeples":["Life is a moving, breathing thing. We have to be willing to constantly evolve. Perfection is constant transformation.","You have to love yourself. That's the single most powerful thing. Out of that springs: How are you eating? How are you exercising? How are you resting?","Health and beauty is not just about what you apply. If you don't have it together on the inside, then nothing else is going to matter.","I knew that I always wanted a family, but I can honestly say that it's nothing like I imagined it would be.","I've had a relationship, a good relationship, with MTV for a long time, and I'd like to maintain that.","When I was younger, before I was married and had children, I really was nit-picky, a perfectionist. I was very much into different people's approval. I had too much time on my hands, I think.","I have a friend who does everything, travels all over the world, goes everywhere, and he says that no matter where in the world he's been, it never gets any better than having a child.","With women, the way they look... it's the core of their self-esteem."],"Nia Sharma":["If you dance alone on the streets, people might call you crazy, but when so many people dance together, it's a party.","I am fine battling lions, tigers, snakes, bulls, even hippopotamuses, but not lizards.","I don't think I am even that popular. In fact, people must be wondering who the hell Nia Sharma is!","It is always good to keep looking different and desirable.","A 12-hour shift is physically exhausting. You give multiple shots, wearing heavy jewellry and make-up - and end up with dark circles, acne, and skin problems.","I had a boyfriend in school, and it was an innocent relationship that I experienced. It's sad that the relationship didn't last forever, but I do look forward to having someone special in my life once again. I'd definitely want to get married if I find my Mr Right.","I want to keep working. I have been stuck in this routine of coming to the set, putting on my make-up, eating, and leaving for home.","Neither do I have the time or the luxury of having a relationship. I don't want to get into fights with someone because I have no time for him.","After 'Jamai Raja,' I wanted to experiment, hence tried my hands at 'Comedy Nights Bachao Taaza.'","It's good to be in the news for whatever reason. I can't pretend that I am not enjoying the attention. Being popular is a good thing.","Yes, my fashion sense is outrageous, but I am a rebel. I am young and still growing up.","I played a bahu for six years on-screen. I really wanted to come out of that.","Frankly, TV stars are not that popular. In fact, I don't have even have a million followers on any of social media accounts.","I am really conscious about what I wear and how I look. I am glad that media has acknowledged this. Over the years, I have really groomed myself.","TV stars don't know how to dress up, and they have to hire a stylist. This is true to a great extent. That's why I go out of my way to experiment. Sometimes I hit the bullseye, sometimes I miss.","People like my fashion sense a lot, but somehow, I never got a chance to wear stuff that I love on screen.","'Ek Hazaaron Mein' turned out to be my identity, it made me Nia Sharma in the industry.","The kind of crazy amount of fan following that I achieved from 'Ek Hazaaron Mein' was amazing. We used to get i-Pads as gift, Abercrombie and Fitch dresses from America. I had everything in the world.","I never thought that I would become Nia Sharma. I never imagined I would end up earning this much money. I never thought I would earn this much in my entire life.","I would not mind stepping into movies if it is a good project. If it is changing my career in a good way, then of course I will keep money aside.","I am a hardcore VH1 lover and always have this dream of featuring in an English music video of VH1.","It's crazy to call myself as the sexiest woman. I'm like, wow; this is cool. Looking at the past years, I was expecting 5th or 6th position. But standing on the 3rd position was totally unexpected.","TV isn't a wide medium when it comes to boldness on the small screen because of the audience. It reaches out to the audience but keeping the traditions intact.","The only medium where people are truly exploring themselves and going out to experiment is the digital space.","Of course it worries you as an actress to stay away from projects. I was approached for many TV soaps as well as reality shows. But, to stay away from work was my decision, and I'd glad to be part of such an interesting and unique concept like 'Ghar Jamai.' I am happy that I am playing a role that is so relatable.","Learning how to swim is the biggest achievement for me, as it helped me get rid of hydrophobia. Now I have become a complete water baby.","I enjoy interacting with my fans.","If someone makes a supernatural-themed show, and it becomes the best show, you are only making money and becoming famous. You are not learning anything from it. It's pure entertainment, even if the content is regressive.","If I feel I am not doing something right, I express it to people and to the media, too. I wouldn't shy away from that. It's healthy to interact. What you see is what you get with me.","Everyone appreciates me for my honesty. Why shouldn't I speak my mind? I will not say I am blunt. I don't speak about others.","It's impossible to beat Katrina Kaif in looks and sex appeal. She's too hot!","I like to style myself and aim to wear the coolest of clothes that I can lay my hands on! It's my conscious effort to look different and dress up funky. I feel elated that people notice the crazy things I do.","I'm not running after glamorous roles, honestly. I'm a performer and want to perform instead of standing like a mannequin wearing a lot of makeup.","I am Nia - I have certain traits of my own, and I won't mind telling people that I am a short tempered, immature, silly, normal girl who does mistakes very unlike the sanskari bahu on screen.","Spaniards are fun-loving people, and they love to dance to Punjabi songs for some reason. They didn't understand the language but enjoyed the beats.","When you go for a vacation, you hit the usual spots, but staying in a country for over a month is a different experience altogether.","Why are people making it so difficult for girls to live the way they want to in India? Let's not make India a place where a girl has to think 10 times before going out or wearing what she wants.","Life's too short to wear boring clothes and apply boring lipsticks, and BTW, I loved my blue lipstick.","There is not much money in web series as compared to what I make on TV. And that is a fact. So I would love to make money at a time when I am getting my price.","I had great apprehension in locking lips with Namit on the screen. I come with my own prerogatives.","I just want to look better by each passing day."],"Nia Vardalos":["America was founded on immigrants. The immigrant experience is common to all of us.","You only get one life so you might as well make it a happy one, and that's why I tend to just jump into things. I'm sort of a fearless idiot that way.","Absolutely, I don't believe in rules. As I tell my daughter when she is mischievous, 'Well-behaved women rarely make history.'","There's a feeling sometimes in motherhood that you're alone in what you're going through, and none of us are alone. We're all going through the same thing.","I do recommend it for all girls, and boys, out there: put on a pair of fishnet stockings and find your inner sexiness!","Women are so many things. We're sisters, mothers, wives. There are so many things we encompass.","In many ways we are all sons and daughters of ancient Greece.","The candid and honest and pure heartedness of children has strengthened my views that we are all equal and should be afforded the basic human rights that we all deserve.","I have found that every family has a strange remedy for any situation - from 'Use Fantastic to get the scuff off your patent leather shoes!' to 'Soak an aspirin in a glass of water to get rid of a migraine.'","We absolutely have to support our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters. We just must. It's not fair that they don't get to live an authentic life.","I do get approached every day by people who say, 'Why don't you make more movies?' I don't really miss it when I get to go and watch my daughter in the Christmas pageant.","I was worried if you adopted a foster child, someone from the birth family could still come and take her back. I was afraid that any child in foster care might have suffered such trauma or neglect that she would be impossible to reach. I'm not proud of these fears. But I understand now when others ask me the same questions.","Don't settle; don't compromise. Freeze your eggs, get your sociology doctorate, worry more about war and pestilence and the incredible inequality of geographical birth than finding your soulmate.","And (cue music swell) motherhood turned out to be the most meaningful thing I've ever done with my life. Really.","We live in an unsafe world.","There are benefits to adopting a toddler. They can tell you what's wrong. And - everything we did with our daughter was a first. Her first tooth fairy. Santa.","I believe that you will not get what you want unless you ask for it.","Like most women, I thought it would be easy once I decided to start a family. I was surprised that Mother Nature kept poking me in the eye, saying, 'Nope, nope, nope.'","Ever since I became a parent, time moves far too quickly. My vision always feels like I'm wearing giant kaleidoscope-goggles.","I consider myself a fearless idiot.","My New Year's Resolution List usually starts with the desire to lose between ten and three thousand pounds.","I have no idea how to use social media for anything other than forwarding a good fart joke.","When I used to do musical theatre, my dad refused to come backstage. He never wanted to see the props up close or the sets up close. He didn't want to see the magic.","You're not ethnic enough. You're not fat enough. You're not thin enough. You're not blond enough. You're not dark enough. You're not young enough. You're not old enough.","You're never too fat for a new purse.","I'd been raised by my parents who taught me not to think you're better than you are.","It's not like suddenly, when you become a working actor all your friends are in the same situation. I have friends who are still handing out flyers for their one-woman show and trying to make ends meet.","What I wish I had, is that I wish I was a little more Greek, in that I wish I could lose my North American driven attitude and that I could be a little bit more poetic and laissez faire.","I don't card out my screenplays ever. I just have an idea I just sit down and write I don't edit.","I couldn't get an acting job to save my life when I moved to L.A.","I think our skin clears up and we're nicer when you are in love.","On the publicity tour of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding,' I was asked over and over again, if, as the writer, I felt it was a fair depiction of real life to have someone of my er, below average looks, hook up with hottie John Corbett.","Socially, the issue of men's weight is simply not a big deal.","Let's face it: Russell Crowe is fat and no one ever talks about it.","I thought I was attractive when I shot 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding.' Studio executives and movie reviewers let me know I had a confidence in my looks that was not shared by them.","My daughter is a preschooler but I have only known her for a while. She is adopted.","It wasn't easy to adopt an American child. Actually it's quite simple, but finding out how to do it was the hard part.","On November 15th, 2008, in over 300 cities, 4,000 children were adopted in one day.","We were so unprepared that when my husband took off to get groceries, and we'd adopted a 3-year-old, he came back with baby formula, a steak and a teething ring. We had no idea what we were doing. But you learn. There's no way to fully prepare. Just eyes wide open - jump.","I've had designers say to my face, 'Oh, I want to dress you now that you're skinny.' And that's really rude.","I grew up looking for myself onscreen and never could find myself. And I believe that I am supposed to be Toula to show people that it's O.K. to be different.","I believe that there are moments in everyone's lives where a door flings open, and if you're terrified of what's on the other side, you must walk through it.","It was a sad process for me to become a mom, and a long process. I felt so embarrassed that I couldn't have a biological child.","I think it's almost easier to do a kissing scene with someone you don't know.","Because I am a character actor, I thought I would be the fourth or eighth banana on a sitcom, and that would be OK.","The white hot publicity that came from 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' was appreciated but not sought, so I was happy to walk away from it and then write.","I had worked for ten years in theater; I had worked at Second City in Chicago. Then I got to Hollywood, and I was like, naively, 'Where's my pilot?'","I don't temper how I feel. I'm Greek. I've got emotions.","I did go through a bit of a dark time during the years I was trying to be a mom. But I'm basically a very positive person.","I feel that the industry can be sliced into two categories - grateful actors and non-grateful actors.","The media was always so focused on the money a movie makes. But I was in Times Square, and a bunch of Japanese tourists looked at me and started shouting, 'Toula!' I loved it. It's these tiny moments of connection that register with me the most and always have.","It's impossible for success to go to your head with a Greek mom - no way.","On my daughter's first day of kindergarten, another mom said something that made me realize I had become my own Greek, suffocating mother. She said, 'Just think, in 13 years they'll leave us and go to college!' And I went, 'Gulp.'","I think there is a moment in every parent's life where we realize that we have lost ourselves a little bit. It's a moment of looking in the mirror and going, 'I need to put on some lipstick.'","I never card out a movie. You know how people will outline or card? I don't do that. I tend to start with an idea and go.","I think it's probably a universal experience that all parents think they're not hovering, but perhaps we all are.","You're as strong as the actors you're working with, your partners.","When I write something, I constantly rewrite.","I have had the same person show up in a few cities with flowers. A lovely gentleman who gave me a picture of himself. I came home, gave it to Ian, and said, 'If I go missing, here's the guy.'","We must make choices that are outside of the familial expectations of us, or we'll just be repeating the mistakes. Our parents came here to give us better choices.","There's this constant guilt that comes with parenting. You always feel like you're never enough. If you're confident in your parenting, you probably suck at it.","Women have to write for each other; we have to hire each other.","It's called show business for a reason. The theater owners want to make money, and understandably so.","Lately, I've been in meetings regarding a new script idea I have. A studio executive asked me to change the female lead to a male, because... 'Women don't go to movies.' Really?","I'm not proud of this, but I had a lot of misconceptions about American foster care. To me, foster care meant that a child would be placed with you, then taken away. I didn't want to go through all of that.","Our daughter was not damaged or hurt in any way. She was simply relinquished to foster care by two people who were not ready to be parents. I admire them for giving her the chance for a better life. And I am grateful they gave my husband and me the opportunity to be parents.","I'm a private person who doesn't relish making her personal life public.","My favorite part of any playdate comes later when I get to carry my exhausted and sleeping daughter to the car. Is there anything more trusting than a sleeping child completely and utterly leaning into your body?","I don't like it if I act anything other than the humble Winnipegger I was raised to be.","Every time I sign a contract, I donate something to charity and buy a piece of jewelry. Whether the movie gets made or not, it's a celebration.","My heroes in real life are definitely my mom for being true to herself, for having a foot in both worlds, for being so very polite - Canadian and also such a traditional Greek woman. I would sum it up this way: the life lesson she would say is be polite while you're breaking the rules.","I believe that if I come home from a stressful day on the set, I just have to leave it there.","I write through improvisation. I never card out a movie. You know how people will outline or card? I don't do that. I tend to start with an idea and go.","I was in a fertility situation publicly, so I disappeared. I was very satisfied just being to able to creatively express myself with writing. The white hot publicity that came from 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' was appreciated but not sought, so I was happy to walk away from it and then write.","I have always written from a personal place.","I feel that the industry can be sliced into two categories - grateful actors and non-grateful actors. I'm always so appreciative that this has happened for me - and against all odds - as a middle child from Canada. I'm very grateful.","I was a very studious student and usually got A's. I did not like school, because I wasn't popular - I was a nerd.","The popular girls let me hang out with them because I was funny. They told me that. 'You're not popular, but you're funny.' Now all my friends are funny.","My husband is an only child of only child parents.","My mum came to the set of my second movie 'Connie and Carla,' and she had made food for the whole cast, including mini bun cakes with little flowers sticking out of each one.","I think the goal is parity: I try to be pro-woman without being anti-man, and I hope and wish that men could do the same in that when they look at the screenplay, they say, 'Wait, wait, wait - is my daughter represented here, is my wife represented here? Is my sister represented?'","I started in Shakespeare. I'm classically trained, which, how hilarious is that? Then one night, I saw Second City and thought, 'Wow, that's what I want to do.' But I never thought it would morph into screenplay writing.","If you create a fun environment, people will take liberties and grow and expand. And then you'll get your final screenplay in my favorite style, which is 'tossed away' - as if the actor just thought of it.","I don't work that much because I am selective.","You can spend an entire summer in Europe, and no one will ask you what you do for a living.","I love romance. I think our skin clears up and we're nicer when you are in love.","We would not have 'America's Funniest Home Videos' without drunk brides and grooms falling into cakes.","Socially, the issue of men's weight is simply not a big deal. Let's face it: Russell Crowe is fat, and no one ever talks about it. Alec Baldwin just orders his suits a size bigger, and we continue to swoon.","I thought I was attractive when I shot 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding.' Studio executives and movie reviewers let me know I had a confidence in my looks that was not shared by them. In other words, they labeled me with words like overweight, unattractive, unappealing.","My blood sugar went out of control. Diabetes runs in my family, so I went to see my doctor. He was like, 'Buck up,' and it was sort of the wake-up call that I needed to hear.","I'm not one of those people that can suddenly start running and hire a Pilates trainer; it's just not my thing.","I'm only happy when people are eating.","My family knows everything about me. There are no secrets, which can be suffocating, but I also find comfort in it. You can always reach out an arm, and an aunty will be close by to tell you that your skirt is too short.","When I wanted to go away to college in Toronto, my dad said, 'You can't go.' When I got to Toronto, I bought a couch, and my dad cried for the whole weekend because, as my mum told me, 'Now you have furniture; he knows you are never coming back.'"],"Niall Ferguson":["Over time, the welfare state has become dysfunctional in a surprising way. But in a way it became a victim of its own success: It became so successful at prolonging life, that it becomes financially unsustainable, unless you make major changes to things like retirement ages.","It's all very well for us to sit here in the West with our high incomes and cushy lives, and say it's immoral to violate the sovereignty of another state. But if the effect of that is to bring people in that country economic and political freedom, to raise their standard of living, to increase their life expectancy, then don't rule it out.","There aren't many people who really put their life on the line for human freedom.","I think that it is important to be gregarious, and that friendships are not just a leisure pursuit, that they are an integral part of what it is to be human, and one does better work if one has a circle of friends that is active.","My fundamental tenets are concerned with freedom of the individual; the market isn't perfect, but it's the best available way of allocating resources.","The great thing about behavioural psychology and economics is that they help us to see that there are actually pretty good reasons why human beings swing from greed to fear, and why we're not really calculating machines or utility-maximisers.","Civilisation is partly about restraining the male of the species from engaging in the violence of the hunter-gatherer period. But it doesn't take an awful lot to unleash it.","The real point of me isn't that I'm good looking. It's that I'm clever. I've got a brain! I would rather be called a highly intelligent historian than a gorgeous pouting one.","Something that's seldom appreciated about me is that I am in sympathy with a great deal of what Marx wrote, except that I'm on the side of the bourgeoisie.","The British press has an insatiable appetite for making public things that should be private. It's a prurience that I've never understood.","The whole point about historians is that we are really communing with the dead. It's very restful - because you read. There's some sociopathic problem that makes me prefer it to human interaction.","A historian is battling all the time to remember as much as possible.","I can't imagine having a conversation about 'Celebrity Big Brother' in Cambridge, Massachusetts.","Through pure accident of birth, I've managed to stay relatively youthful.","The debate that I'm interested in having is with seriously smart people about how we design institutions in the 21st century that will genuinely address problems of poverty and educational underachievement.","Ask me not, 'Are you rightwing,' but ask me 'Are you a committed believer in individual freedom, the values of the enlightenment?' Then, yeah, if being rightwing means believing Adam Smith was right, both in the 'Wealth of Nations' and the 'Theory of Moral Sentiments,' then I'm rightwing.","If being rightwing is thinking that Karl Marx's doctrine was a catastrophe for humanity, then I'm rightwing.","As a teacher, my strategy is to encourage questioning. I'm the least authoritarian professor you'll ever meet.","It's great to see countries like China and India lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty by essentially copying Western ways of doing things.","One of the main arguments that I make in my new book, 'The Great Degeneration,' is that the rule of law in the U.S. is becoming the rule of lawyers.","I can't think of anything I would rather do with my money than buy my children the best possible education.","I was never a very convincing social conservative, and always avoided associating myself with that part of the broader conservative movement.","I would say I'm a 19th-century liberal, possibly even an 18th-century one.","The rise of the West is, quite simply, the pre-eminent historical phenomenon of the second half of the second millennium after Christ.","I think the rise of quantitative econometrics and a highly mathematical approach to risk management was the obverse of a decline in interest in financial history.","Risk models are a substitute for historical knowledge, because they tend to work with just three years' worth of data. But three years is not a long time in financial history.","What's so seductive about the efficient markets hypothesis is that it applies nine years out of ten. A lot of the time it works. But when it stops working, you blow up.","President Obama's biggest weakness is weakness.","I have three kids in Britain, and I am there at least once a month.","Only in England would 'professor gets divorced and remarried' be a story.","As a financial historian, I was quite isolated in Oxford - British historians are supposed to write about kings - so the quality of intellectual life in my field is much higher at Harvard. The students work harder there.","In general, I have felt more at home in the U.S. than I ever felt in England.","When I first came to Oxford, I struggled to feel comfortable in an Anglican, public school-dominated institution.","I'm over-industrious, so I don't feel quite such a deviant in America as I did in England.","We historians are increasingly using experimental psychology to understand the way we act. It is becoming very clear that our ability to evaluate risk is hedged by all sorts of cognitive biases. It's a miracle that we get anything right.","It's not surprising so many people end up with credit-card debts. Saving for your retirement and buying a house are difficult things, and we don't educate people about them at all.","Oral history is a recipe for complete misrepresentation because almost no one tells the truth, even when they intend to."],"Niall Horan":["Someone told me the smile on my face gets bigger when I play the guitar.","I just like sitting at home, chilling and watching a movie.","I get really nervous if pigeons are flying around before shows. I can't stand them after one once flew in through my bathroom window and went for me while I was having a wee. That was enough. I think pigeons target me.","I'm not really a flirt; I just try to be myself.","I feel I am a little bit older. Reckon I will start growing a beard next week.","I think there's so much feeling among young girls where they feel like they have to be this perfect thing - and they don't. Perfect people don't exist. Sometimes people need to be told it.","You have to think outside the box! Can you imagine One Direction and Eminem?! That would be hilarious.","You can see girls getting too excited and they start crying or worse. In a lot of these countries they don't get a lot of gigs to go to, so when they get to see their favorite artist they take full advantage of it. Obviously the excitement builds up too much for some on the night and they get a bit... crazy.","Fans always tell me I'm beautiful, but no one will ever be as beautiful as them.","I'd rather be a kid and play with paper planes, than be a man and play with a woman's heart.","Katy Perry is the sexiest woman I've ever kissed. It was amazing and very purple - she had purple lipstick on. I don't think there will ever be anything cooler than kissing her... until I marry her maybe!","A personal highlight was probably when we got a No. 1 in the U.K. and when the album went to No. 1 in America. The top four that week was us, Adele, Guns N' Roses and Bruce Springsteen. It was ridiculous seeing those names there. Being the first band from the U.K. and Ireland to go to America and debut at No. 1 is just unbelievable.","A squirrel attacked me. I got attacked by a squirrel in Battersea Park. They're dangerous. It's rare. I've torn most of the ligaments in my knee. So no football for me. It's early retirement now. I've got a floating knee-cap!","I'm the most carefree, happy person you'll meet.","I had my first kiss when I was 11, but I think I've blocked it out of my mind because it was so bad. I'm not even sure it counts as a kiss.","I've got an IQ of 40 million.","I don't want to live up to how people expect me to be.","When I have time off, all I want to do is do nothing.","I don't see how you could get used to people screaming in your face, and anyone who says different is lying.","I'm an emotional guy, so I don't have to worry about a girl trying to get me to open up.","I actually haven't been on many dates, but I like just chilling around at home and watching a movie with a girl.","I want to sell out arenas and make an album and work with some of the best artists in the world.","I'm quite claustrophobic, and I don't like everyone crowding around and shouting the same questions.","It's just impossible to believe I've become good friends with some stars like Justin Bieber. I would call Justin a friend, someone I hang out with. It's really weird.","I've got my old favorites like The Eagles and Bon Jovi.","Katy Perry still gets me every time. She's very funny in person! We met at the Teen Choice Awards and she pulled my cheeks apart and told me how cute I was. My life was literally flashing before my eyes!","Queuing tips for fans: wrap up and bring food!","I've not actually been on too many dates.","The bigger the crowd the better really! The noise calms your nerves.","There's always pressure on the second album - this one has to be the big one.","I don't get to go home as much as I used to, which is a shame. But I don't mind because my mum moved over to London to look after me. I rented her a house just around the corner.","Can clearly say Vegemite is horrible! Like tryin' new stuff though.","I had a girlfriend when I was about 13 but we didn't stay together for very long and I've not really been out with many people since. I've still never had a serious girlfriend but I would happily go out with someone if the right girl came along.","'Ted' made me nearly cry. It's kind of like 'Marley and Me.'","Everyone gets that second album syndrome.","I was starstruck by Michelle Obama. She's an amazing-looking lady, and I'm a massive Barack Obama fan anyway.","Simon Cowell is tight. That's why he's so successful - he's able to keep his money to himself."],"Niall Matter":["I'm a little bit of a gypsy myself. I've always had jobs where I'm moving around and I'm not sure what's going to happen tomorrow or the next day.","I started off as a director, so when I see other actors directing, it gives me hope that maybe they'll put me into that position at some point, too.","I'm an intellectual, but I've always had jobs that required physical labor above all else.","I'm not of a science background, I was never a comic book geek, and I was never a gamer."],"Nic Pizzolatto":["Killing characters on television has become an easy short cut to cathartic emotion.","Whatever story you're telling in Louisiana, the landscape is going to become a character in it.","I grew up in Louisiana and spent my formative years there. There's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all.","When you're a confused 19-year-old filled with questions you can't even articulate and a kind of black rage that feeds at your heart from the moment you wake up in the morning, and you discover Marcus Aurelius' 'The Meditations,' that changes your life.","If I write scripts that nobody likes, I don't think we'll be doing 'True Detective.'","I made 'True Detective' like it was going to be the only thing I ever made for television. So put in everything and the kitchen sink. Everything.","I was raised by television. It was my first cultural window. It was a constant companion.","Art was always for me an escape and a way to relate to the world around me.","It's better to not have a reputation than a bad one.","I don't think you can create effectively toward expectation. I'm not in the service business.","If landscape is a character for me, then it helps if I'm familiar with it and I already have a take on it.","For me as a storyteller, I want to follow the characters and the story through what they organically demand.","If there was one overarching theme to 'True Detective,' I would say it was that, as human beings, we are nothing but the stories we live and die by - so you'd better be careful what stories you tell yourself.","There's never been anything I didn't love that I didn't connect with on a personal level because, to some degree, I projected upon it.","For me, the worst writing generally just 'flips' things: this person's really a traitor; it was all a dream; etc. Nothing is so ruinous as a forced 'twist,' I think.","I was raised in a heavily Catholic family. Early and consistent encounters with mysticism.","I read 'The Conspiracy Against the Human Race' and found it incredibly powerful writing. For me as a reader, it was less impactful as philosophy than as one writer's ultimate confessional: an absolute horror story, where the self is the monster.","You know how people say that young people feel immortal? I don't know what they're talking about. I was planning for how I would deal with my death in good conscience well before I even hit puberty.","I'd want to bring a flamethrower to faculty meetings. The preciousness of academics and their fragile personalities would not be tolerated in any other business in the known universe.","I didn't come to Hollywood to be subservient to anyone else's vision.","Whatever I watched, whatever I loved in 36 years of life on Earth, probably had some influence on me.","Often, what allows someone to behave heroically in dire circumstances is unpalatable in day-to-day life.","Most television shows are going to require an actor sign up from four to six years, but an anthology show really amounts to five or six months at the most. I thought serious actors might be attracted to that.","I enjoy a third act, and I like stories with ending. A lot of my frustration with serialized storytelling is a lot of shows don't have a third act. They have an endless second act, and then they find out it's their last year and often have to hustle to invent a third act, but they were never necessarily organically meaning to begin with.","In the summer of 2010, I was working on a version of 'True Detective' that I was thinking might be my next novel, and it was told in these two first-person voices; Cohle and Hart's voices.","Nothing in the television show 'True Detective' was plagiarized.","For the finale, I thought the audience deserved to get a close point of view on the monster, and to recognize him the way you recognize the heroes of 'True Detective.'","There are websites of 'True Detective' artwork out there now, and it's beautiful. And I don't want to take that away from anybody. I know what it means to me. But I don't want to take away anyone's interpretation of the show.","We live in a culture that has a real hard time distinguishing fiction from reality. Even when they're told something is fiction.","We're all born storytellers. It's part of the species. But, more specifically, I suppose a particular combination of sensitivity and trauma made me a writer: an essential disquiet with reality, which required exploration through portrayal.","TV and film were always governing passions of mine, and that first wave of great HBO shows in the early years of the millennium was feeding my desire for fiction more than the books I was reading.","The idea of being a show runner was very attractive to me, to create and control something.","I find the constraints of drama actually freeing: It brings everything down to character and action.","I grew up in a working-class Catholic family in south Louisiana. I went to a state university. I taught literature, wrote a novel that was the novel I wanted to write, and got a couple of good reviews but no real traction. I had no idea how to get a job in TV.","I knew 'True Detective' wasn't something I could allow anyone else to develop. But by the time HBO expressed an interest, I still had no real experience.","It's your job to come up with compelling characters who speak to an individual authenticity. If I'm not interested in the characters, I can't go on. I have to be fascinated by them.","The work is where I tend to feel pressure - not so much in the reaction to it.","'True Detective' is a densely layered work with resonant details and symbology and rich characterization under the guise of one of the forms of this mystery genre. That's what we shoot for.","The conspiracies that I've researched and encountered, they seem to happen very ad hoc: they become conspiracies when it's necessary to have a conspiracy.","In the summer of 2010, I had decided to get into film and TV writing, so I wrote scripts for six different ideas I had developed, and the pilot for 'True Detective' was one of them.","As someone with a novelistic background, I just didn't have much interest in creating stories by committee. I don't think you necessarily get the best story through that approach.","If you are a certain kind of hands-on learner and have been in a writers room and know how scripts get made, and you know what pre-production is, then mostly it's making sure the actors get what they need, and you are providing creative oversight while allowing room for everyone else to own the material, too.","I left the University of Chicago's creative writing program for a tenure-track job at DePauw University in Indiana, then left DePauw in 2010 for Los Angeles.","At DePauw, I was teaching writing and fiction. The things I wanted to teach, more than anything else, were form and theory of the novel, of narrative. I liked those classes.","I liked teaching, but the bureaucracy of academia and the petty intrigue... It wasn't a good fit. Once I admitted that myself, that I didn't like academia, I was ready to try TV.","'The Atlantic' really gave me my writing career - even just the conviction to be a writer.","You just do the best you can, and when you're able to connect with people, and when you do, it's just incredibly gratifying."],"Niccolo Machiavelli":["Politics have no relation to morals.","The more sand has escaped from the hourglass of our life, the clearer we should see through it.","The wise man does at once what the fool does finally.","There is no avoiding war; it can only be postponed to the advantage of others.","It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both.","The promise given was a necessity of the past: the word broken is a necessity of the present.","I'm not interested in preserving the status quo; I want to overthrow it.","He who wishes to be obeyed must know how to command.","It is double pleasure to deceive the deceiver.","Whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times.","If an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared.","Where the willingness is great, the difficulties cannot be great.","It is not titles that honor men, but men that honor titles.","When you disarm the people, you commence to offend them and show that you distrust them either through cowardice or lack of confidence, and both of these opinions generate hatred.","There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.","The first method for estimating the intelligence of a ruler is to look at the men he has around him.","Hatred is gained as much by good works as by evil.","One who deceives will always find those who allow themselves to be deceived.","There are three kinds of intelligence: one kind understands things for itself, the other appreciates what others can understand, the third understands neither for itself nor through others. This first kind is excellent, the second good, and the third kind useless.","Men ought either to be indulged or utterly destroyed, for if you merely offend them they take vengeance, but if you injure them greatly they are unable to retaliate, so that the injury done to a man ought to be such that vengeance cannot be feared.","Never was anything great achieved without danger.","Men should be either treated generously or destroyed, because they take revenge for slight injuries - for heavy ones they cannot.","Of mankind we may say in general they are fickle, hypocritical, and greedy of gain.","It is much more secure to be feared than to be loved.","Before all else, be armed.","Men rise from one ambition to another: first, they seek to secure themselves against attack, and then they attack others.","To understand the nature of the people one must be a prince, and to understand the nature of the prince, one must be of the people.","One change always leaves the way open for the establishment of others.","A prince never lacks legitimate reasons to break his promise.","No enterprise is more likely to succeed than one concealed from the enemy until it is ripe for execution.","Princes and governments are far more dangerous than other elements within society.","For among other evils caused by being disarmed, it renders you contemptible; which is one of those disgraceful things which a prince must guard against.","The main foundations of every state, new states as well as ancient or composite ones, are good laws and good arms you cannot have good laws without good arms, and where there are good arms, good laws inevitably follow.","A return to first principles in a republic is sometimes caused by the simple virtues of one man. His good example has such an influence that the good men strive to imitate him, and the wicked are ashamed to lead a life so contrary to his example.","There is no surer sign of decay in a country than to see the rites of religion held in contempt.","The one who adapts his policy to the times prospers, and likewise that the one whose policy clashes with the demands of the times does not.","Benefits should be conferred gradually; and in that way they will taste better.","We cannot attribute to fortune or virtue that which is achieved without either.","A son can bear with equanimity the loss of his father, but the loss of his inheritance may drive him to despair.","The fact is that a man who wants to act virtuously in every way necessarily comes to grief among so many who are not virtuous.","Tardiness often robs us opportunity, and the dispatch of our forces.","A wise ruler ought never to keep faith when by doing so it would be against his interests.","The wish to acquire more is admittedly a very natural and common thing; and when men succeed in this they are always praised rather than condemned. But when they lack the ability to do so and yet want to acquire more at all costs, they deserve condemnation for their mistakes.","Men are so simple and yield so readily to the desires of the moment that he who will trick will always find another who will suffer to be tricked.","God is not willing to do everything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us.","Whoever conquers a free town and does not demolish it commits a great error and may expect to be ruined himself.","The new ruler must determine all the injuries that he will need to inflict. He must inflict them once and for all.","Since it is difficult to join them together, it is safer to be feared than to be loved when one of the two must be lacking.","War is just when it is necessary; arms are permissible when there is no hope except in arms.","Hence it comes about that all armed Prophets have been victorious, and all unarmed Prophets have been destroyed.","War should be the only study of a prince. He should consider peace only as a breathing-time, which gives him leisure to contrive, and furnishes as ability to execute, military plans.","It is necessary for him who lays out a state and arranges laws for it to presuppose that all men are evil and that they are always going to act according to the wickedness of their spirits whenever they have free scope.","Severities should be dealt out all at once, so that their suddenness may give less offense; benefits ought to be handed ought drop by drop, so that they may be relished the more.","Men are so simple and so much inclined to obey immediate needs that a deceiver will never lack victims for his deceptions.","Men shrink less from offending one who inspires love than one who inspires fear.","Nature that framed us of four elements, warring within our breasts for regiment, doth teach us all to have aspiring minds.","The distinction between children and adults, while probably useful for some purposes, is at bottom a specious one, I feel. There are only individual egos, crazy for love."],"Niccolo Paganini":["I am not handsome, but when women hear me play, they come crawling to my feet.","In order to move others, I must be moved.","The violin is my mistress, but the guitar is my master.","At Vienna, one of the audience affirmed publicly that my performance was not surprising, for he had distinctly seen, while I was playing my variations, the devil at my elbow, directing my arm and guiding my bow. My resemblance to the devil was a proof of my origin.","When I attained my seventh year, my father, whose ear was unmusical but who was nevertheless passionately fond of music, gave me my elementary lessons on the violin; in a very few months, I was able to play all manner of compositions at sight.","At a grand evening service in a church, my concerto created such a furor that the worshippers rushed out to keep the crowd outside the church quiet."],"Nichelle Nichols":["I was very blessed in always knowing what I wanted to do, and by the grace of God I've been able to succeed in my chosen career.","It's just coincidental that the acting took off first over everything else.","I think anybody with any intelligence sits down and sees Star Trek not a kids' show.","All the people in Star Trek will always be known as those characters. And what characters to have attached to your name in life! The show is such a phenomenon all over the world.","Billie Holiday I never met, but I love her music.","I've agreed to do several Star Trek conventions this coming year.","Mahalia Jackson, I grew up around the corner from in Chicago."],"Nicholas A. Christakis":["The social sciences offer equal promise for improving human welfare; our lives can be greatly improved through a deeper understanding of individual and collective behavior. But to realize this promise, the social sciences, like the natural sciences, need to match their institutional structures to today's intellectual challenges.","I'm not suggesting that social scientists stop teaching and investigating classic topics like monopoly power, racial profiling and health inequality. But everyone knows that monopoly power is bad for markets, that people are racially biased and that illness is unequally distributed by social class.","Whether we appreciate it or not, we live out our lives surrounded by an intricate pattern of social connections... We're all embedded in this network; it affects us profoundly and we may be unaware of its existence, of its effect on us.","We and others have done a bunch of work to show that if your real friends online say or do something, it affects you. But if your acquaintances online say or do something, it does not. People on average have about 106 Facebook friends, but only 5 or 6 real friends.","What constrains or enables the capacity of human beings to work in groups is not so much the technology, but rather the capacity of the human brain to have and monitor social interactions.","Social media and the Internet haven't changed our capacity for social interaction any more than the Internet has changed our ability to be in love or our basic propensity to violence, because those are such fundamental human attributes.","One reason citizens, politicians and university donors sometimes lack confidence in the social sciences is that social scientists too often miss the chance to declare victory and move on to new frontiers.","It is time to create new social science departments that reflect the breadth and complexity of the problems we face as well as the novelty of 21st-century science. These would include departments of biosocial science, network science, neuroeconomics, behavioral genetics and computational social science.","I like to have met someone in real life before being their Facebook friend.","It's important for students to take their studies seriously.","My entire youth was spent with an incredibly ill parent... I don't think you can grow up that way and not be marked by that experience.","It's fashionable to speak about vulnerable populations in medicine and public policy, but it's harder to find a more vulnerable population than those who are dying.","The reason we form networks is because the benefits of a connected life outweigh the costs. It's to our advantage as individuals and a species to assemble ourselves in this fashion.","There are very fundamental reasons we live our lives in social networks, and if we really understood the role they're playing in our society, we would take better care of social networks and find ways to take advantage of their power to improve our society.","People have just assumed that... if we call our Facebook acquaintances our friends, we must be influenced by them, too. But we're not.","It used to be thought that our genes were historically immutable and that it was not possible to imagine a conversation between culture and genetics.","Realizing the ways in which we humans may have been inadvertently changing our genes for millennia provides a way for us to begin to think about the inevitable genetic revolution in medicine that is going to allow us to advertently change our genes over centuries and even decades.","We will create life from inanimate compounds, and we will find life in space. But the life that should more immediately interest us lies between these extremes, in the middle range we all inhabit between our genes and our stars.","It is well to look around at whom, and not just what, surrounds us. Population structure will change everything. Our health, wealth, and peace depend on it.","We're not just social animals in the conventional way that people think. It's not just a bunch of us who hang out together. We have a very specific pattern of ties, and they have a particular shape and structure that is encoded in our genes. It means that human beings have evolved to live their lives embedded in social networks.","It is the spread of the good things that vindicates the whole reason we live our lives in networks. If I was always violent to you or gave you germs, you would cut the ties to me and the network would disintegrate. In a deep and fundamental way, networks are connected to goodness, and goodness is required for networks to emerge and spread.","Just because we say networks are important doesn't mean that networks explain everything. We're just adding additional information. Networks don't work like a match - they work like a magnifying glass.","We are, first of all, not solitary creatures and second of all, we are deeply embedded in the lives of others. It's very easy to forget that and to engage in an atomistic fallacy - where we think that all we have to do is study the individual components of a system in order to understand the system.","We cannot understand our humanity just by studying individuals.","Everyday interactions we have with other people are definitely contagious, in terms of happiness.","Social networks are these intricate things of beauty, and they're so elaborate and so complex and so ubiquitous that one has to ask what purpose they serve."],"Nicholas Braun":["It would be nice to have someone to go back to, a girl to call at the end of the night after a long day.","I was in the drama club, and I was one of seven co-presidents of the student body. Students elected me - I don't know why!","I was in the drama club, and I was one of seven co-presidents of the student body. Students elected me; I don't know why!

I still do today. I just work on it a lot. I obsess, if you will, with it, but I stuttered throughout my childhood.","My brain is just always going and going and going.","It's funny, when you become an actor and you're successful, they don't want to talk about acting any more. 'Hey let's talk about that stuff you were fired from.'","I couldn't help feeling people thought I was a moron, and my self-imposed insecurity constantly bedeviled me.","Constant repetition of tongue-twisters was like lifting weights for me, but patience and persistence have paid off.","Look, I know what it feels like to believe you're 'different' in a bad way.","I played baseball in college but I didn't identify with the jocks, I was in my own little world .","As an actor, it's more interesting to play a nerd than anything else. It's a lot more fun - you don't worry about 'what's my hair like?' in the morning or 'which is my great angle?'","I always wanted to be an actor, but with a speech impediment it's kind of tough. I decided to roll the dice and take an acting class, which was very, very nerve-wracking... my stomach would just be in knots.","When I first started auditioning I would stutter a lot because I was so terribly frightened.","I've had to work on being a slow talker."],"Nicholas Breton":["Thus much for thy assurance know; a hollow friend is but a hellish foe.","We rise with the lark and go to bed with the lamb.","I wish my deadly foe no worse Than want of friends, and empty purse."],"Nicholas Culpeper":["Such Roots as are soft, your best way is to dry in the Sun, or else hang them up in the Chimney corner upon a string; as for such as are hard you may dry them any where.","Waters are distilled out of Herbs, Flowers, Fruits, and Roots.","The Herbs ought to be distilled when they are in their greatest vigor, and so ought the Flowers also.","In all Diseases strengthen the part of the Body afflicted.","Gather all Leaves in the hour of that Planet that governs them.","For God's sake build not your faith upon Tradition, 'tis as rotten as a rotten Post.","The Barks of Trees are best gathered in the Spring, if it be of great Trees, as Oaks or the like, because then they come easiest off, and so you may dry them if you please, but indeed your best way is to gather all Barks only for present use.","All Juleps are made for present use, and therefore it is in vain to speak of their duration.","Thus have you the way of making Conserves, the way of keeping of them is in Earthen pots.","Let your Medicine be something of the Nature of the Sign ascending."],"Nicholas D'Agosto":["I'm realizing for the first time, your life goes on while you're trying to pursue this career. I saw my career as everything. But you have this life, too. Living your life fully, you come to know yourself better. You'll find the place for it.","I like going to museums and stuff, but I also like going out and doing lots of physical activity like camping and hiking. I like doing stuff that I've never done before. Curiosity is a big thing. Usually it means that people are intelligent and that they want to learn stuff about the world.","You know that thing when you're not asleep but you're not awake, and you can't move your body? I had that kind of nightmare, and I felt like all my teeth were crumbling in my mouth. Now I have this fear of all my teeth being knocked out of my mouth somehow!","When I meet a girl, I just sort of do really over-exaggerated terrible dance moves... a lot of hip movements. I get them laughing, and get them to feel pity for me, and then they like me!","In the summer after sixth grade, I took a class at St. Robert Bellarmine. My first role, I was the villain in a play, and I forgot all my lines. I think I cried my way through the performance.","The business can be frustrating. For me, Omaha is a rounding foundation. I was raised in a very faith-filled household, very hardworking. It made me aware of what privilege is. And it's a place I can go back to, spend time with nieces and nephews, celebrate the things that have nothing to do with the hubbub of Hollywood.","I'm growing very talented at watching blood and guts on screen because I have zero emotional response."],"Nicholas D. Kristof":["You will be judged in years to come by how you responded to genocide on your watch.","The conflict in Darfur could escalate to where we're seeing 100,000 victims per month.","The news media's silence, particularly television news, is reprehensible. If we knew as much about Darfur as we do about Michael Jackson, we might be able to stop these things from continuing.","One of the things that really got to me was talking to parents who had been burned out of their villages, had family members killed, and then when men showed up at the wells to get water, they were shot.","You don't need to invade a place or install a new government to help bring about a positive change.","While Americans have heard of Darfur and think we should be doing more there, they aren't actually angry at the president about inaction.","A little bit of attention can go a long way.","I think it's dangerous to be optimistic. Things could go terribly wrong virtually overnight.","Most of the villagers were hiding in the bush, where they were dying from bad water, malaria and malnutrition.","Every year 3.1 million Indian children die before the age of 5, mostly from diseases of poverty like diarrhea.","All of a sudden their husband's dead and maybe a child is dead and they have absolutely nothing - and they're heading through the desert at night.","There seems to be this sense among even well-meaning Americans that Africa is this black hole of murder and mutilation that can never be fixed, no matter what aid is brought in.","Just a little help, a small security force, a bit of food, can save lives.","The photos were taken by African Union soldiers. People in Congress saw them. I thought if people could see them, there would be public outcry. No one would be able to say, We just didn't know what was going on there.","It really is quite remarkable that Darfur has become a household name. I am gratified that's the case.","There isn't a political price to be paid yet for doing nothing. People need to get upset with President Bush. People need to get upset with their Congressmen.","There are other issues I have felt more emotionally connected to, like China, where I lived and worked for some time. I was living there when Tiananmen Square erupted.","As soon as I was old enough to drive, I got a job at a local newspaper. There was someone who influenced me. He wrote a column for The Guardian from this tiny village in India.","I have often tried to tell the story of a place through people there.","The fact that people will pay you to talk to people and travel to interesting places and write about what intrigues you, I am just amazed by that.","The bulk of the emails tend to come after a column. I can get about 2,000 after a column.","I try to be careful about wording. One of the things I've tried to combat in my blog is the notion that journalists are arrogant and unconcerned with the readership.","It's easy to keep issuing blame to Republicans or the president.","We all might ask ourselves why we tune in to these more trivial matters and tune out when it comes to Darfur.","Neither Western donor countries like the U.S. nor poor recipients like Cameroon care much about Africans who are poor, rural and female.","Half a million women die each year around the world in pregnancy. It's not biology that kills them so much as neglect.","The U.N. Population Fund has a maternal health program in some Cameroon hospitals, but it doesn't operate in this region. It's difficult to expand, because President Bush has cut funding.","Neither left nor right has focused adequately on maternal health.","Abortion politics have distracted all sides from what is really essential: a major aid campaign to improve midwifery, prenatal care and emergency obstetric services in poor countries.","A few countries like Sri Lanka and Honduras have led the way in slashing maternal mortality.","The world spends $40 billion a year on pet food.","The north of the Central African Republic is now a war zone, with rival armed bands burning villages, kidnapping children, robbing travelers and killing people with impunity.","Random violence is incredibly infectious.","If President Bush is serious about genocide, an immediate priority is to stop the cancer of Darfur from spreading further, which means working with France to shore up Chad and the Central African Republic."],"Nicholas Gonzalez":["We fight the stereotypes, but in fighting them, we show them. There are stereotypes for a reason.","It's so much more interesting having life under your belt.","Actors don't request what scenes to be written in. That's just not how it works.","It's just a fun time going up to Vancouver.","So far, I have looked and looked for a detailed plan from Hillary Clinton's campaign that can tell me where she really stands, but there is none. It is difficult to trust that a candidate will be the right one for our community when you don't exactly know what their plan is.","The hope of a nation depends on a president that will follow through even in the most unfavorable of political climates.","Bernie Sanders supports offering a pathway to citizenship for immigrants already in the U.S. and halting deportations for almost 9 million hardworking undocumented fathers and mothers.","Until a legislative solution to the nation's outdated immigration system becomes a priority for Congress, the right administration will need to examine a broad range of executive actions to enact immediately in the face of a 'Do Nothing Congress.'","My father's a dermatologic surgeon; my brother's a surgeon.","A lot of really good actors are able to go straight from life to their work. They don't treat it as something that's an unattainable, weird thing that they have to aspire to and reach for in a scene.","It's a bit disturbing to me that people have to evolve to the idea that people are equal.","If it hadn't been for Senator Sanders, I don't know if I would've been brought back into the fold of politics.","You can ask any Latin actor: inevitably, if they get a part meant for a white guy, producers will change the character's name to sound more Latin.","I want to be a storyteller - not only of the Latin experience but of people who want to be inspired.","I no longer take on everything offered. Instead, I go up for roles I like, things that I would enjoy watching, stories that I want to tell.","In a hospital, there's a lot of high-energy, seat-of-your-pants, in-the-moment things that need to be done.","I want to stop making decisions based on money, start saying no to stuff I don't have fun with anymore.","I'm being called in by all the great casting directors. It's no longer based on a headshot. I realize now what they're buying is passion.","There's so much more work for a man in his mid-30s: a lot of female-driven shows, where everybody needs a husband or partner.","Just because we finally have a Latino family on TV doesn't mean we're up there to lecture people about what it means to be Latino.","After graduation, I moved to Los Angeles to do more theater, not realizing there is very little theater in L.A. It was a lucky mistake, though, because after just 2 1/2 months of waiting tables, my TV and film career really took off.","I think I've learned quite a bit about the battle of the sexes or, at least, how to keep the status quo a little bit more.","Men love strong and independent women. Always have and always will!","You can have levels of trust, and you can question trust, but it shouldn't be something that's absent. I think, for any sort of relationship, there has to be levels of that.","I've been fortunate that a lot of roles I've done have been professionals and not your TV stereotype of Latinos.","I'd love my own show, but I'm really happy to be on 'Pretty Little Liars.'","I worked with Devin Kelley on 'Resurrection,' and Mekhi Phifer has been a long time buddy."],"Nicholas Haslam":["I don't do nostalgia. The phrase 'the good old days' never passes my lips.","Interior decoration partly thrives on being social.","I go to Topman at lunchtime and stare at these beautiful, beautiful people who work there and who are so well-dressed. And I think: 'Oh! I want to look like that! They're amazing, how well-dressed they are!'","Sunday afternoon is for papers and writing.","I don't really do a big Saturday supper. I prefer entertaining in the daytime.","I'm hopeless at telling lies. I can attempt strategic ones in order not to hurt people's feelings, but then I'll blow it 10 minutes later.","I could care less if it's Mick Jagger or the man on the street. I just like interesting people, and I happen to know a lot of stars.","I believe every room speaks, tells you what to do to it. You have to listen to that.","It's terribly easy to be well dressed. It's much more difficult to be badly dressed.","It's the fashion, I tell you: big, tall women going out with tiny, tiny men.","I wanted to be grown up the minute I could.","I'm about love.","It's rude to not try and look up-to-date. Is rude the right word? Yes! It's rude - rude to other people.","Vanity is not having facelifts if you're ugly. Those people who say: 'Oh, I'd never dream of having anything done!' That's rude. It's rude, to other people, to not try and look your best; to not try and stir things up, to not reinvent... or just invent... it's one's duty to not get stuffy.","I have always aspired towards other people's looks. When I was young, I loved teddy boys; I thought they looked wonderful. Then I was a cowboy in Arizona, really for the clothes! I had a ranch for five years; I had chaps made of bearskin.","I didn't want to look distinguished; I wanted to look fun, and also to fade into the street, into the King's Road. If I don't fade into a room at White's, that's fine. My father was chairman of Brooks' and the Beefsteak, and I was brought up in that life, and it bores me rigid.","I'd like not to have these great puffy lobes on my ears - I'd like them to taper in.","I've always wanted to look different. I always think I've got this terrible figure. I'd like to be 3 inches taller.","Sometimes I think it would be nice to share everything I've got with somebody - and sometimes I think I'm very lucky to have the bathroom to myself. But I feel it would be nice to pass on my knowledge. Perhaps because I haven't got children - one wants to educate somebody.","I have a thirst - it's an awful word, but I'm thirsty for knowledge. I like knowing things, the odder the better, the more obtuse the better.","I think what I have is straightforwardness, unabashedness rather than charm.","I don't feel I have to charm somebody, I feel I want to know them; it's a different thing.","I'm afraid of people, in a way.","You can learn the subtle language of interior style, but many people simply buy it. If you put yourself in the hands of someone who knows what they are doing, you can be confident it will look good.","Often it's a lack of time, not taste, that leads someone to hire a decorator. A good decorator/client relationship should be like a marriage. The time one puts in needs to be extensive. One needs to listen to them and understand what they like and how they live.","People think that buying something for their home which is up-to-date is chic, but often it's a cliche. I call people who simply give clients the current 'thing' stylists not decorators.","I had a face-lift, and I would have another if I needed one. It definitely changed my life. I'm not vain. In fact I don't like looking at myself. The face-lift was just about looking rested.","The English truly understand the dynamic between buildings and land.","Most English houses, grand or small, nestle in an intimate pastoral setting.","I tend to look out for things with a resonance to my youth - artists or objects that seemed romantic all those years ago. I never buy anything purely for its value. I like possessions that smile back at me.","I've always chased glamour.","I've never paid attention to politics. I only have the vaguest notion of what the IRA is.","New York in the '60s was amazing.","I'm the male Kate Moss.","I have a natural curiosity for people.","I rent a Jacobean-fronted hunting lodge in Hampshire from the National Trust and like to go there as much as possible. I've grown to love it so much, especially when writing my memoirs there at weekends."],"Nicholas Hoult":["Nowadays we have so many things that take our attention - phones, Internet - and perhaps we need to disconnect from those and focus on the immediate world around us and the people that are actually present.","I don't really have disappointments, because I build myself up for rejection.","If you're out, and starving, and need a bite to eat, then you need fast food.","When you're on TV and in people's houses - it's great that anybody watches anything you've done, but you feel as though you're being watched by Big Brother sometimes. Even if people have no idea who you are, you get the feeling you're being watched.","Long-term boredom can't lead to anything good.","I can be a bit grumpy. I'm full of angst, and hormones.","Other people's success spurs me on to do well and gives me motivation.","I don't mind my eyebrows. They add... something to me. I wouldn't say they were my best feature, though. People tell me they like my eyes. They distract from the eyebrows.","By the time I was 14, I was about six foot. I remember going into auditions, and they'd look at how tall I was and say, 'Well, you're taller than the lead actor, so there's no way we can cast you.'","When I like something, I love it, but then I'll let it go completely.","The paparazzi don't care about me.","I always like to keep busy, otherwise my brain starts ticking.","I'm not one of those people who sits around knowing all bands and going to gigs all the time.","The action stuff is only good if you get the character stuff in there as well. Sometimes that get lost in amongst all the trying to make stuff blow up.","After 'Skins' I became mildly famous, which was a bit of a disaster.","I've realized why I don't tell the truth in interviews. It's because they're printed months later, and you change so quickly - you have new thoughts, new everything - so people are reading an old version of you.","Occasionally people will look at me and do a double take and they'll look at me like they're trying to think where they know me from.","I don't think parents always know where their children are going or what they are doing, what they are up to.","I think all teenagers feel alone, and that nobody else knows what they are going through and all that sort of stuff.","I think if you set yourself specific goals, that's quite a lot of pressure.","I don't want to share my worries - that's for me to know.","I'm kind of feeling ashamed now that I never get bullied. Everyone keeps asking me, but I don't, and it's kind of annoying. I wish I could say I did get bullied, because then everyone would feel sorry for me.","I'd just like to carry on acting.","I've got a really great family round me, two sisters and an older brother and my mum and dad. Everybody's equal.","I'm happy with my career and I'm not going to have the trouble of being typecast.","I try not to be too optimistic or pessimistic. If you're a pessimist then that's depressing all the time; if you're an optimist and things don't work out then that's depressing, too.","Life's too short for regrets.","It's a scary life and sometimes you think you'll never work again.","My mum always says work goes in waves: you have a good spell and then it dips.","I'm not scared of growing up, but it just happens, doesn't it?","It's awkward going to parties with people you don't know, especially when they think they know you.","Supposedly I'm impossible to talk to. But it's honestly not me being difficult. Sometimes you just don't have a lot to say.","I think interviews can be fine. It's just there's this terrible fear of coming off wrongly or saying something that gets taken out of context.","As a kid, when you're in a film with somebody, you look up to them, you know?","As you're growing up, it's odd, because directors don't expect you to grow up. They think you'll be young forever, but as an actor, there is an awkward period when you're too young for old or too old for young, and it can be an odd time.","The lead actor, along with the director, plays a big role in what the vibe will be on set, and that's a huge responsibility.","A lot of child actors keep acting for the wrong reasons.","I'll eat anything. I ate antelope once in Swaziland. I didn't know what it was until I'd started chewing it. Everything tastes like chicken though doesn't it? It wasn't bad.","I won't eat veal, and my mum won't eat lamb, because she thinks it's a bit harsh to eat cute things.","I want to get more muscly.","I manage to live pretty normally.","I just want to be a better actor. You can always get better.","Anybody who has a problem with 'Skins' obviously doesn't understand teenage life.","I remember doing my SATs on a film set; you had to complete the tests in a certain time and, obviously, you couldn't be interrupted. I think I did pretty well; it wasn't too difficult."],"Nicholas II of Russia":["I am not yet ready to be Tsar. I know nothing of the business of ruling.","There is no justice among men."],"Nicholas Jarecki":["Why is the public so interested in movies about the wealthy? My answer is that Shakespeare wrote about kings. That's where the action is. And it's the classic, cathartic thing. You get to indulge in a lifestyle you're not part of, a tragic error leads to a downfall, and you get to say, 'Thank God I'm not him.'","My dad used to sell a type of commodity contract. It was so complicated, he was certain his sales people didn't understand what they were selling.","Aristotle wrote the 'Poetics' 2,400 years ago. It's really an instruction manual for aspiring filmmakers. It's as valid today as it was then.","I think that ultimately any effective drama or tragedy tries to put you as much as it can into the protagonist's shoes.","I loved films of the '70s with those antihero protagonists who you don't know if you can get behind because their behavior is really questionable.","Doing anything on a movie at Sundance is great.","Writing and directing your own film, for me, has been the best experience of my life.","I've written plenty of scripts that sucked.","I keep a list of everyone I've ever met.","I think that people need to become more educated about money. We need to stop creating systems that benefit only the most-cutthroat sharks.","Feature filmmaking is a different kind of complication as documentary comes in the editing room.","I spent 12 years doing different things in film trying to figure out the story I wanted to tell.","When you're editing the film, you use a temp track. So you're putting music in there for a rough cut to keep track of what's going on. It can be a hindrance if wrong, it can be an enormous asset if you get it right.","Some people are in positions of power, and when incentives go haywire, we are all human and it's easy to make mistakes. I am not saying everybody is Bernie Madoff."],"Nicholas Johnson":["All television is educational television. The question is: what is it teaching?","It used to be that people needed products to survive. Now products need people to survive.","A viewer who skips the advertising is the moral equivalent of a shoplifter.","Taxing poor families runs counter to decades of effort to help people lift themselves out of poverty through work."],"Nicholas Kristof":["The wilderness is healing, a therapy for the soul.","Why are fanatics so terrified of girls' education? Because there's no force more powerful to transform a society. The greatest threat to extremism isn't drones firing missiles, but girls reading books.","Beware of generalizations about any faith because they sometimes amount to the religious equivalent of racial profiling. Hinduism contained both Gandhi and the fanatic who assassinated him.","I was the first blogger on the Times's website. That happened during the Iraq war, when I wanted an outlet for the things I was seeing every day that couldn't fit into just two columns a week. Then I became interested in using multimedia, specifically as a way to engage young people.","Young people often aren't in a position to write checks to charities. But there are two things they can do that are invaluable. One is volunteering, especially mentoring other young people with reading, math or help thinking about college. Through iMentor, one can even mentor people online.","Doesn't it seem odd that your cellphone can be set up to require a PIN or a fingerprint, but there's no such option for a gun?","Inequality causes problems by creating fissures in societies, leaving those at the bottom feeling marginalized or disenfranchised.","Every high school and college graduate in America should, I think, have some familiarity with statistics, economics and a foreign language such as Spanish. Religion may not be as indispensable, but the humanities should be a part of our repertory. They may not enrich our wallets, but they do enrich our lives. They civilize us. They provide context.","Our world is enriched when coders and marketers dazzle us with smartphones and tablets, but, by themselves, they are just slabs. It is the music, essays, entertainment and provocations that they access, spawned by the humanities, that animate them - and us.","Most of the time in the 21st century, we dominate our surroundings: We tweak the thermostat, and the temperature falls one degree. We push a button, and Taylor Swift sings for us. It's the opposite in the wilderness, which teaches us constantly that we are not lords of the universe but rather building blocks of it.","Worrying about bills, food, or other problems leaves less capacity to think ahead or to exert self-discipline. So, poverty imposes a mental tax.","Above all, we want Millennials to realize that they can have an impact on the world and that, in the course of empowering others, they can also empower themselves.","Climate change is hugely exacerbated by changing patterns of how we choose to live, often in danger zones such as extremely vulnerable coastal zones - from New Jersey to the Philippines. This enormously increases the economic and human costs of hurricanes, rising seas and changing weather patterns.","The greatest problem is not with flat-out white racists, but rather with the far larger number of Americans who believe intellectually in racial equality but are quietly oblivious to injustice around them.","A basic element of the American dream is equal access to education as the lubricant of social and economic mobility.","What use could the humanities be in a digital age? University students focusing on the humanities may end up, at least in their parents' nightmares, as dog-walkers for those majoring in computer science. But, for me, the humanities are not only relevant but also give us a toolbox to think seriously about ourselves and the world.","You no more have the right to risk others by failing to vaccinate than you do by sending your child to school with a hunting knife. Vaccination isn't a private choice but a civic obligation.","I've always been interested in public health approaches because it seems to me we have this yearning for silver bullets, and that is not in fact how change comes about. Change comes through silver buckshot - a lot of little things that achieve results. That's a classic public health approach.","The Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine, is in northwestern India near the Pakistani border, and it is a delightful place to contemplate the draw of faith.","Maybe our best family trip started at Victoria Falls, which drenches you with spray and is so vast that it makes Niagara Falls seem like a backyard creek. Then we rented a car and made our way to Hwange National Park, which was empty of people but crowded with zebras, giraffes, elephants and more.","Our public figures are often narcissists, utterly self-absorbed in their quest for power.","I can't help thinking that if the American West were discovered today, the most glorious bits would be sold off to the highest bidder. Yosemite might be nothing but weekend homes for Internet tycoons.","Wilderness trails constitute a rare space in America marked by economic diversity. Lawyers and construction workers get bitten by the same mosquitoes and sip from the same streams; there are none of the usual signals about socioeconomic status, for most hikers are in shorts and a T-shirt and enveloped by an aroma that would make a skunk queasy.","Since the end of the 1970s, something has gone profoundly wrong in America. Inequality has soared. Educational progress slowed. Incarceration rates quintupled. Family breakdown accelerated. Median household income stagnated.","In 2013, 71 percent of black children in America were born to an unwed mother, as were 53 percent of Hispanic children and 36 percent of white children. Indeed, a single parent is the new norm.","One of the things you learn as a journalist is that when there's no accountability, we humans are capable of tremendous avarice and venality. That's true of union bosses - and of corporate tycoons. Unions, even flawed ones, can provide checks and balances for flawed corporations.","We journalists are a bit like vultures, feasting on war, scandal and disaster. Turn on the news, and you see Syrian refugees, Volkswagen corruption, dysfunctional government. Yet that reflects a selection bias in how we report the news: We cover planes that crash, not planes that take off.","One of the most crucial kinds of intervention is in advocacy. We can think about charities in the context of delivering services, and indeed that is part of their job, but advocacy is also getting governments to step up to the plate. They can also give more voice to those who don't have one.","If I wanted a circus ringmaster, I'd hire Trump. If I wanted advice on brain surgery or hospital management, I'd turn to Carson. Fiorina would make an articulate television pundit. But for president?","It's maddening in my travels to watch children dying simply because they were born in the wrong place at the wrong time.","Gays and lesbians began to gain civil rights when Americans realized that their brothers, cousins, daughters were gay.","When I was born in 1959, the hospital in which I arrived had separate floors for black babies and white babies, and it was then illegal for blacks and whites to marry in many states.","There are very few things I've done just twice in my life, 40 years apart, and one is to backpack on the Pacific Crest Trail across the California/Oregon border.","Humans pull together in an odd way when they're in the wilderness. It's astonishing how few people litter and how much they help one another. Indeed, the smartphone app to navigate the Pacific Crest Trail, Halfmile, is a labor of love by hikers who make it available as a free download.","I took a gap year myself after high school and worked on a farm near Lyon, France. I stayed with the Vallet family, picked and packed fruit, and discovered that red wine can be a breakfast drink. That led to further travel as a university student.","One death is a tragedy, and a million deaths are a statistic.","One of my frustrations is that we in society generally have this bifurcation in how we see the world. That's probably a little less true with business audiences, but in general, there tends to be this view that for-profit companies are greedy, and nonprofits are noble. It's absolutely more complicated than that.","Things that happen every day are, frankly, what we in the news business aren't good at covering because there is no one day in which they are news.","Individual storytelling is incredibly powerful. We as journalists know intuitively what scientists of the brain are discovering through brain scans, which is that emotional stories tend to open the portals, and that once there's a connection made, people are more open to rational arguments.","The best escalator to opportunity in America is education.","In Angola, I visited 'HeroRats' that have been trained to sniff out land mines (and, in some countries, diagnose tuberculosis). In a day, they can clear 20 times as much of a minefield as a human, and they work for bananas!","Dr. Ben Carson has the most moving personal narrative in modern presidential politics. His mother, one of 24 children, had only a third-grade education. She was married at age 13, bore Ben and his brother, and then raised the boys as an impoverished single mother in Detroit. As a young boy, Carson was a terrible student.","Saudi Arabia has supported Wahhabi madrasas in poor countries in Africa and Asia, exporting extremism and intolerance. Saudi Arabia also exports instability with its brutal war in Yemen, intended to check what it sees as Iranian influence.","Saudi Arabia isn't the enemy, but it is a problem. It could make so much positive difference in the Islamic world if it used its status to soothe Sunni-Shiite tensions and encourage tolerance. For a time, under King Abdullah, it seemed that the country was trying to reform, but now under King Salman, it has stalled.","In effect, Saudi Arabia legitimizes fundamentalism, religious discrimination, intolerance and the oppression of women. Saudi women not only can't drive, but are also told by some clerics that they mustn't wear seatbelts for fear of showing the outlines of their bodies.","Saudi Arabia inflames the Sunni-Shiite divide and sets a pernicious example of intolerance by banning churches.","For all Trump's criticisms of government, his family wealth came from feeding at the government trough. His father, Fred Trump, leveraged government housing programs into a construction business; the empire was founded on public money.","There's something to be said for CEOs' entering politics: In theory, they have management expertise and financial savvy. Then again, it didn't work so well with Dick Cheney.","When the poor know that their children will survive, when they educate their daughters, when they access family planning, they have fewer children.","If only meat weren't so delicious! Sure, meat may pave the way to a heart attack. Yes, factory farms torture animals. Indeed, producing a single hamburger patty requires more water than two weeks of showers. But for those of us who are weak-willed, there's nothing like a juicy burger.","My take is that the optimal approach to food, for health and ethical reasons, may be vegetarianism.","The ice bucket challenge went viral in 2014, partly because it was so much fun to watch videos of celebrities or friends dumping ice water on their heads. Videos of people in the challenge have been watched more than 10 billion times on Facebook - more than once per person on the planet.","Most of the time in America, we're surrounded by oppressive inequality such that the wealthiest 1 percent collectively own substantially more than the bottom 90 percent. One escape from that is America's wild places.","Remember that disadvantage is less about income than environment. The best metrics of child poverty aren't monetary, but rather how often a child is read to or hugged.","One of our worst traits in journalism is that when we have a narrative in our minds, we often plug in anecdotes that confirm it. Thus we managed to portray President Gerald Ford, a first-rate athlete, as a klutz.","The one public system in which America goes out of its way to provide services to African-Americans is prison.","Too often, I believe, liberals deny that poverty is linked to bad choices.","Technology companies must constantly weigh ethical decisions: Where should Facebook set its privacy defaults, and should it tolerate glimpses of nudity? Should Twitter close accounts that seem sympathetic to terrorists? How should Google handle sex and violence, or defamatory articles?","Literature seems to offer lessons in human nature that help us decode the world around us and be better friends.","When I was growing up, yearning with my pals to be a track star, one of our heroes was Bruce Jenner. He won a gold medal at the 1976 Olympics in the decathlon, and he adorned our Wheaties boxes. We all wanted to be Bruce Jenner.","Sex and gender are such befuddling mysteries even for those of us who are in the mainstream that you'd think we'd be wary of being judgmental. Yet much of society clings to a view that gender is completely binary, when, in fact, there's overwhelming evidence of a continuum.","In America, we have subsidized private jets, big banks and hedge fund managers. Wouldn't it make more sense to subsidize kids?","My father, a refugee from Eastern Europe, was preparing a fraudulent marriage to an American citizen as a route to this country when he was sponsored, making fraud unnecessary. My wife's grandfather bought papers from another Chinese villager to be able to come to the United States.","We all stand on the shoulders of our ancestors. We're in a relay race, relying on the financial and human capital of our parents and grandparents. Blacks were shackled for the early part of that relay race, and although many of the fetters have come off, whites have developed a huge lead.","Anybody looking at the history even of the 20th century would not single out Islam as the bloodthirsty religion; it was Christian/Nazi/Communist Europe and Buddhist/Taoist/Hindu/atheist Asia that set records for mass slaughter.","The caricature of Islam as a violent and intolerant religion is horrendously incomplete. Remember that those standing up to Muslim fanatics are mostly Muslims.","The great divide is not between faiths, but one between intolerant zealots of any tradition and the large numbers of decent, peaceful believers likewise found in each tradition.","I wouldn't want everybody to be an art or literature major, but the world would be poorer - figuratively, anyway - if we were all coding software or running companies. We also want musicians to awaken our souls, writers to lead us into fictional lands, and philosophers to help us exercise our minds and engage the world.","Too often, wealthy people born on third base blithely criticize the poor for failing to hit home runs. The advantaged sometimes perceive empathy as a sign of muddle-headed weakness rather than as a marker of civilization.","Perhaps no country in Latin America is more picturesque than Bolivia, and the most memorable Bolivian city may be Potosi.","Zimbabwe has far fewer tourists than South Africa or Kenya, and there's less crime as well.","At some point, extra incomes don't go to sate desires but to attempt to buy status through 'positional goods' - like the hottest car on the block. The problem is that there can only be one hottest car on the block.","I suspect unconscious bias has been far more of a factor for President Obama than overt racism and will also be a challenge for Hillary Rodham Clinton if she runs for president again.","She may hide it, but Clinton is a policy nerd. Ask about microfinance, and she'll talk your ear off. Mention early childhood interventions, and she will gush about obscure details of a home visitation experiment in Elmira, N.Y., that dramatically improved child outcomes.","You educate a boy, and he'll have fewer children, but it's a small effect. You educate a girl, and, on average, she will have a significantly smaller family.","Girls' education is no silver bullet. Iran and Saudi Arabia have both educated girls but refused to empower them, so both remain mired in the past. But when a country educates and unleashes women, those educated women often become force multipliers for good.","Conservatives highlight the primacy of family and argue that family breakdown exacerbates poverty, and they're right. Children raised by single parents are three times as likely to live in poverty as kids in two-parent homes.","Sure, food stamps are occasionally misused, but anyone familiar with business knows that the abuse of food subsidies is far greater in the corporate suite. Every time an executive wines and dines a hot date on the corporate dime, the average taxpayer helps foot the bill.","However imperfectly, subsidies for the poor do actually reduce hunger, ease suffering and create opportunity, while subsidies for the rich result in more private jets and yachts. Would we rather subsidize opportunity or yachts? Which kind of subsidies deserve more scrutiny?","Utah may well be the most cosmopolitan state in America. Vast numbers of young Mormons - increasingly women as well as men - spend a couple of years abroad as missionaries and return jabbering in Thai or Portuguese and bearing a wealth of international experience.","I have a one-question language test that people who have lived abroad do better on than those who studied in a classroom. Try my test yourself: In a foreign language you've studied, how do you say 'doorknob'?","One of the aims of higher education is to broaden perspectives, and what better way than by a home stay in a really different country, like Bangladesh or Senegal? Time abroad also leaves one more aware of the complex prism of suspicion through which the United States is often viewed.","Conservatives are, I think, correct to highlight family stability as a fundamental issue that goes to the welfare of children as much as food stamps or anything else.","I'm sometimes embarrassed by how clinical I can become when I'm out reporting.","Numeracy isn't a sign of geekiness, but a basic requirement for intelligent discussions of public policy.","One of the biggest complaints readers have about my work is that I don't tell them often enough what they can do. I do think this is an area where journalism sometimes falls short. We describe a really grim situation but don't really explain to people what they can do about it.","I think we in journalism were really late to social networks. We had a built-in network already in terms of our readers, and we didn't capitalize on that.","During the Arab Spring, I learned all sorts of things from Twitter. I wouldn't necessarily trust that information, but it gave me ideas about questions to ask. You can really learn things from the wisdom of crowds.","I think we need to rethink a lot of business skills. In finance, for example, social impact bonds are potentially a way of providing capital for investments that save the public money in a context in which government often doesn't invest in things that would save it money.","Purely altruistic behavior is pretty much impossible because of the selfish pleasures we derive from it.","Traditionally, what we in the news business do is cover what happened yesterday.","I do think that humanitarians and journalists alike have focused on all the things that go wrong, and that they sometimes leave the perception in the public that the war on poverty has been lost. That Africa is just a bottomless pit of despair. When, in fact, really the opposite is true on both fronts.","I think humanitarian organizations should acknowledge the progress more than they do. I think that one reason people are reluctant to provide more help to Africa, for example, is this sense that it's just hopeless, in a way that I think is untrue.","It is so much easier to try to help a six-month-old child or a six-year-old child than it is a 16-year-old troubled kid.","Most moms and dads, they want to be good moms and dads. But it's an incredibly hard job when you are stressed out, when you are poor, when your life is in chaos. And giving them some of the tools to be better parents, to whittle away at that parenting gap, gives those kids a much better starting point in life.","Seniors vote, and that is why we have, you know, Medicare since the 1960s for seniors, and we didn't have a national healthcare program for children, even though it's a lot more cost-effective to deal with children than with seniors.","One of the things that evangelicals do really, really well is to make giving a joyous, social enterprise. Too often, the world sees giving as a burden, a sacrifice, when in fact it's more like an opportunity to help others and oneself at the same time.","Ben Affleck exec-produced a documentary for HBO called 'Reporter' about my 2007 win-a-trip journey. I take the trip each year partly to encourage young people to think about global humanitarian issues: I think blogs by a student may be more compelling for that audience than my own work.","I think humanitarians really feel very awkward and embarrassed about marketing, but it really doesn't matter whether a shampoo gets better marketing. It does matter when a famine or a huge crisis is - oh - well, I hate to use the word 'marketed' better but, you know, is publicized in a way that will be more effective."],"Nicholas Lea":["My sister is a nurse and saves people's lives.","Two shows at once is crazy, but I love it.","And I've been lucky in that I haven't had another job besides acting in the last five years.","There's one site where you can buy pictures of me for five bucks a pop.","We both have a great loyalty to it, and I think that it's important to give it our best shot.","I really enjoy the people. I find them to be better educated and wittier.","My heritage is English, so I'm proud to be back here.","We went to the British Museum, and I was looking up my family in the books - pages and pages on it.","It makes you realise that people are the same wherever you go.","It changed my life in a lot of ways - before I got that role I was just going from job to job, not really having enough money to be able to do what I wanted to do.","You can be in an acting class all you want, but you don't fully learn until you get off that stage and in front of a camera.","When you're doing a series like this, you're constantly looking for new ways to excite your audience.","Supporting characters add depth to a story, and great actors leave their imprint with the audience.","Everything has an end.","I felt that K wasn't getting a fair shake anyway.","It's not that fun to just play a villain, without any reasoning behind it.","I wanted more in depth ideas about the character and it never came.","I think everyone has some fascination with what's outside our existence. It's a constant journey to find the truth.","It's certainly more interesting for me as an actor, but I think it's also more interesting for the audience to see three-dimensional characters, rather than just a bad guy or a good guy.","I've spent so much time the last seven, eight years in Los Angeles, away from my family, away from my friends, away from the city that is my favourite place to be and I just want to come here and have a proper life.","L.A. to me is not really an attractive place.","I just wanted to act. I didn't want to do anything else.","When I'm on my deathbed, I'll hopefully be able to count more friends than parts that I had.","At Christmas, 'It's a Wonderful Life' makes me cry in exactly the same places every time, even though I know it's coming.","I'm living in L.A. but my heart's in Vancouver.","My goal is to be living back in Canada as soon as I can, hopefully somewhere in the Gulf Islands.","It seems there's a sliding scale between the money they spend on a movie and its creativity.","I'm trying to do the kind of projects that I want to see in the theatre.","I would like to look back on my career and be proud of what I've done.","That's sort of what I like about this character is that he's not the good guy, he's not truly the bad guy.","I don't care what TV show you work on, even a movie for that matter, it's all about time and money eventually.","I think somebody who speaks the language is going to notice immediately that I'm not Russian.","Comedy and drama are both challenging to me.","Certainly, when I walk into an audition, a lot of people already know who I am.","So, I completely and utterly support David and Gillian's decision to go to Los Angeles, but I think that Vancouver is the perfect location for the show."],"Nicholas M. Butler":["Optimism is essential to achievement and it is also the foundation of courage and true progress.","Optimism is the foundation of courage.","America is the best half-educated country in the world.","Necessity does the work of courage.","Many peoples' tombstones should read 'Died at 30, burried at 60.'","An expert is one who knows more and more about less and less."],"Nicholas Meyer":["Art doesn't just happen by accident. It is about pulling out new tricks and trying new things.","I was always a filmmaker before I was anything else. If I was always anything, I was a storyteller, and it never really made much of a difference to me what medium I worked in.","Schools and libraries are the twin cornerstones of a civilized society. Libraries are only good if people use them, like books only exist when someone reads them.","The director is a bit analogous to the conductor of a symphony orchestra. It's a collaborative adventure.","As a writer, you have control of the words you put on the page. But once that manuscript leaves your hand, you give control to the reader. As a director, you are limited by everything: weather, budget, and egos.","A screenplay is not a finished product; a novel is. A screenplay is a blueprint for something - for a building that will most likely never be built.","Actors will change their face, will change their hair, will change their voice, will disappear into the role. A movie star doesn't disappear.","An actor is someone who pretends to be somebody else. A movie star is somebody who pretends that somebody else is them.","The first thing that put me on the map was my Sherlock Holmes novel.","There are moments in one's life where you look back and you say, 'Well, I wish I had done this differently.'"],"Nicholas Mosley":["To say a poem is absolute is saying nothing, because an ink blot can be absolute. Yet you put into it what you like. So it becomes totally relative.","It connects with the theologians' point that you can say what God is not, but not (easily) what He is.","Not only the style, but the way in which you don't exactly know what on earth has happened or is happening till about page two hundred - then it all becomes apparent in a blinding flash.","If they tell the police, the police will find out she was driving, and her career will be put into hell.","I don't think I've ever read an old book through from start to finish. Not after more than six months after writing it, that is.","There is curiously little art concerning the efficacy of reason - perhaps simply because reason is not noticeably efficacious.","It always strikes me how almost unbelievably bad are the early versions of my novels.","After these three novels I gave up writing novels for a time; I was dissatisfied with romantic doom, yet didn't see much way around it.","The mark of a living thing is to be involved in opposites (impossibilities): the living cell that has to be continually adapting itself to stay alive, with its identity.","I did not think much what I was writing them for, except that I knew I wanted my next novel to be in some less conventional form than straight narrative."],"Nicholas Negroponte":["Computing is not about computers any more. It is about living.","The laptop brings back a more seamless kind of learning.","Learning by doing, peer-to-peer teaching, and computer simulation are all part of the same equation.","Even in the developing parts of the world, kids take to computers like fish to water.","If you take any world problem, any issue on the planet, the solution to that problem certainly includes education. In education, the roadblock is the laptop.","We've been working now with computers and education for 30 years, computers in developing countries for 20 years, and trying to make low-cost machines for 10 years. This is not a sudden turn down the road.","Cell phones were more popular in Cambodia and Uganda because they didn't have phones. We had phones in this country, and we were very late to the table. They're going to adopt e-books much faster than we do.","Key is the question of where do new ideas come from. Historically, four places: government labs, big corporations, startup companies, and research universities.","This is just the beginning, the beginning of understanding that cyberspace has no limits, no boundaries.","By the year 2000, most Americans will be online one way or another.","We have to make machines understand what they're doing, or they won't be able to come back and say, 'Why did you do that?'","It's hard to propose a $100 laptop for a world community of kids and then not say in the same breath that you're going to depend on the community to make software for it.","Giving the kids a programming environment of any sort, whether it's a tool like Squeak or Scratch or Logo to write programs in a childish way - and I mean that in the most generous sense of the word, that is, playing with and building things - is one of the best ways to learn.","Nature is pretty good at networks, self-organizing systems. By contrast, social systems are top-down and hierarchical, from which we draw the basic assumption that organization and order can only come from centralism.","Companies cannot really see beyond their current customer base. They explicitly or implicitly do things to protect their current customers. And the last person to want real change is your customer. This is why most new ideas come from small companies that have nothing to lose.","Big companies are looking closer term, and even the most technological companies spend less than 1% of sales on research. Startups have suffered the burst bubble.","Everybody agrees that whatever the solutions are to the big problems, they... can never be without some element of education.","It bothers me when people spoil the market.","We all learned how to walk and talk by interacting with our environment, with real goals and rewards.","Access by kids to the Internet should be like kids breathing clean air.","Linux is its own worst enemy: it's splintered, it has different distributions, it's too complex to run for most people.","I'm not good at selling laptops. I'm good at selling ideas.","My goal is not selling laptops. OLPC is not in the laptop business. It's in the education business.","One of the arguments here at OLPC is, if 100 million kids could have an Asus running Windows, is that better with two million kids running the XO? And the answer is yes. We want kids connected and the largest possible number is the goal.","Give One, Get One generated about 100,000 zero-dollar laptops. Somebody else paid for them, but from the recipient's point of view, that's zero.","When you meet a head of state, and you say, 'What is your most precious natural resource?' they will not say children at first, and then when you say, 'children,' they will pretty quickly agree with you."],"Nicholas Pileggi":["As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.","Let me tell you something. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to. Unless they make themselves get caught. They don't have things organized."],"Nicholas Ray":["I never try to show an actor what to do or what to say. He has to find out for himself. The role of the director is to guide him to that state, and then to implement it.","As a human being, Joan Crawford is a great actress.","If it were all in the script, why make the film?","The imagination is a pretty precious source of protection.","An actor can be as talented as another, but if he doesn't stick to what the director's intentions are, it all falls down. I adore working with actors."],"Nicholas Sparks":["I don't know that love changes. People change. Circumstances change.","Romance is thinking about your significant other, when you are supposed to be thinking about something else.","I think that men know how to romance a woman and most do it well, at least for a time, otherwise women wouldn't marry them. The problem is that most of them begin to rest on their laurels.","Loving once and only once is possible - anything is possible.","I think that enduring, committed love between a married couple, along with raising children, is the most noble act anyone can aspire to. It is not written about very much.","Focus in on the genre you want to write, and read books in that genre. A LOT of books by a variety of authors. And read with questions in your mind.","Over time, quality work will lead to an audience for your work.","I read over a hundred books a year and have done so since I was fifteen years old, and every book I've read has taught me something.","All characters come from people I know, but after the initial inspiration, I tend to modify the characters so they fit with the story.","Writing the last page of the first draft is the most enjoyable moment in writing. It's one of the most enjoyable moments in life, period.","I suppose I'm most influenced by any good, commercial writer. I learn from everyone.","Rekindled love is generally short-term.","The first thing I did when I sold my book was buy a new wedding ring for my wife and asked her to marry me all over again.","I have certain moral parameters that I do not cross in writing; I don't write about adultery or kids having premarital sex.","Dramatic fiction - William Shakespeare made his biggest mark writing dramatic love stories.","I'm writing a new love story, set in eastern North Carolina. Surprise, surprise, huh?","By reading a lot of novels in a variety of genres, and asking questions, it's possible to learn how things are done - the mechanics of writing, so to speak - and which genres and authors excel in various areas.","I suppose more than anything, it's the way of life in this part of the country that influences my writing. In Eastern North Carolina, with the exception of Wilmington, most people live in small towns.","In all love stories the theme is love and tragedy, so by writing these types of stories, I have to include tragedy.","What's the challenge in writing a novel that few people will read? I'm more than happy writing what I do and have no plans to change that.","I write 2,000 words a day when I write. It sometimes takes three hours, it sometimes takes five hours.","My wife, my family, my friends - they've all taught me things about love and what that emotion really means. In a nutshell, loving someone is about giving, not receiving.","There's always pressure, a great deal of pressure, when writing, since my first books were so successful.","None of my characters are rich or famous, and the situations they find themselves in could happen to anyone.","I do not use profanity in my novels. My characters all go to church.","Spreading the news is your duty as a Christian, and there are many ways to do this.","To be quite honest, I've been very blessed when I've worked with Hollywood. The studios that have purchased my work to be adapted to film have really liked the work and wanted to stay as close as they could to what the book was.","Publishing is a business. Writing may be art, but publishing, when all is said and done, comes down to dollars.","Because publishing is becoming more business-oriented each day with more examination of the bottom line, it's harder to break out than ever.","I'll admit that it's not easy to get an agent, but becoming successful in anything requires perseverance.","Above all, a query letter is a sales pitch and it is the single most important page an unpublished writer will ever write. It's the first impression and will either open the door or close it. It's that important, so don't mess it up. Mine took 17 drafts and two weeks to write.","A typical agent in New York gets 400 query letters a month. Of those, they might ask to read 3-4 manuscripts, and of those, they might ask to represent 1.","If you look for me, I'm in the fiction section. Romance has its own section.","I don't write romance novels.","I would be rejected if I submitted any of my novels as romance novels.","I think, above all, the characters in my novels feel universal to the readers.","I very seldom, very seldom, even know what my characters look like.","I have a great wife and it's very easy to be romantic because it makes her happy and then my life is so much better when she's happy."],"Nicholas Stern":["Science and policy-making thrive on challenge and questioning; they are vital to the health of inquiry and democracy.","Those who say that climate change doesn't exist are being understood as the flat-earthers that they are, as the people who deny the link between smoking and cancer, as the people who denied the link between HIV and AIDS.","I think it's important that people think about what they are doing and that includes what they are eating. I am 61 now and attitudes towards drinking and driving have changed radically since I was a student. People change their notion of what is responsible. They will increasingly ask about the carbon content of their food.","My father's generation's crisis was fighting fascism. Ours is fighting climate change. It is much harder because you can't see it, it is not an obvious threat. But the solution is in our hands.","I think that once people understand the great risks that climate change poses, they will naturally want to choose products and services that cause little or no emissions of greenhouse gases, which means 'low-carbon consumption.' This will apply across the board, including electricity, heating, transport and food.","Meat is a wasteful use of water and creates a lot of greenhouse gases. It puts enormous pressure on the world's resources. A vegetarian diet is better.","The basic scientific conclusions on climate change are very robust and for good reason. The greenhouse effect is simple science: greenhouse gases trap heat, and humans are emitting ever more greenhouse gases.","Enlightened self-interest from those involved in hydrocarbons should lead to the support of technologies enabling the clean use of hydrocarbons, such as carbon capture and storage, and not to the defence of deniers and cranks.","A diet that relies heavily on meat production results in higher emissions than a typical vegetarian diet. Different individuals will make different choices. However, the debate about climate change should not be dumbed down to a single slogan, such as 'give up meat to save the planet.'","We will not overcome world poverty unless we manage climate change successfully. I've spent my life as a development economist, and it's crystal clear that we succeed or fail on winning the battle against world poverty and managing climate change together. If we fail on one, we fail on the other.","The one way of guaranteeing to fail is to assume that we will.","If coal is going to be used, the only response - because it is the dirtiest of all fuels - is that we have to learn how to do carbon capture and storage and we have to learn how to do it quickly on a commercial scale.","As an undergraduate, I did maths and physics. That doesn't make me a scientist. So I try to read and understand and talk to scientists.","The greenhouse effect is something you can observe experimentally - and most people have observed the greenhouse effect themselves, in greenhouses. Yes?","I've never really had much of a career plan, and interesting opportunities kept cropping up.","To claim the World Bank is just an extension of U.S. foreign policy is just wrong.","It's very important that there should be cross-fertilisation between government and academia. Both parties can benefit from having a better understanding of how the other works.","If you look at all the serious scientists in the world, there is no big disagreement on the basics of this... it would be absolute lunacy to act as if climate change is not occurring.","We can look back through ice-core data and see over 800,000 years, relationships between carbon dioxide and the temperature of the world. So those people who deny the importance of climate change are just wasting their time. They're also being diversionary because if we don't act the risks are enormous.","How is it that, in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence, there are still some who would deny the dangers of climate change? Not surprisingly, the loudest voices are not scientific, and it is remarkable how many economists, lawyers, journalists and politicians set themselves up as experts on the science.","We run enormous risks and we know what kind of reductions of greenhouse gases are necessary to drastically reduce risks. Reducing emissions by half by 2050 is roughly in the right ballpark. It would bring us below 550 ppm."],"Nicholas Stoller":["I mean, come on: At the end of the day, we're all bisexual. A hundred years from now, there's not gonna be gay or straight. There's gonna be everything.","The huge advantage of boarding school is that it throws you into the social fire. Every social interaction I've had since then has been a million times easier. Literally, ever since then, it's all been child's play.","If you're engaged more than a year, there's something up. There's lot of debate as to whether one should or shouldn't get married, but when you get engaged, it's a promise to get married, and if you don't just do it within a year, one of the parties is using the excuse of, like, 'I can't find the right venue' to put off the wedding.","Each of the 'Toy Story's are telling an emotional story, but they're comedic. They're so successful creatively in terms of the stories they're telling. And they're pretty grounded.","I love watching how people who are in love with each other deal with each other. Every time I've had a fight with an ex-girlfriend, at the time they're horrible, but when I look back they're often funny and weird, and that kind of stuff makes me laugh.","I've thrown way more movie parties than real parties. My real life is so much more boring.","There are still movies where females are just there to be cool, or they are there to lambaste their husbands and scold. But female comedy characters are changing for the better.","I think the best romantic comedies don't have villains.","A big part of being in a relationship or marriage or whatever is you have to eventually compromise. Your life doesn't end up exactly the way you think it's going to, and if it's the right relationship, you might have to compromise what you're doing professionally.","I knew after 'Sarah Marshall' that my favorite genre is romantic comedy. Nothing is more satisfying than a great romantic comedy.","I was born in England - though both of my parents are American - and there's something about the 'Muppets' where they have this combination of English and American humor.","As a comedy writer, I'm always praying for the day I can tell a self-aware/break-the-fourth-wall style of joke.","When the photographer is nearby, I like to say, 'Quick, get a photo of me looking into the camera,' because I'm never looking into the camera. Christopher Nolan looks into the camera, but I think most directors don't, so whenever you see a picture of a director looking at the camera, it's fake.","The movies I've made, I'm really proud of them. But the experience I've had is, people say to me, 'Oh my God, I saw your movie on HBO. It was actually funny.' Like, that's always the experience. It's a backhanded compliment.","There are so few good comedy sequels. The only one in recent memory that's good is '22 Jump Street.' It's a hard genre.","Your characters can do the worst things on Earth - cut to a happy baby, it ends up being OK.","It's really weird casting babies; it's kind of the dark underbelly of Hollywood, to meet babies and judge them.","I would never make a purely autobiographical movie, because it would be incredibly boring. But I always bring something. It's usually some emotional truth I've experienced, like in 'Get Him to the Greek,' the relationship between Jonah Hill and Elisabeth Moss, I had certainly had that kind of relationship with a girlfriend.","I watched all kinds of dirty movies as a kid. My parents were very liberal about that, and I was still an uber-nerd who never drank or did drugs. I don't think it matters.","I just watched 'Lethal Weapon' for the first time, and it's awesome... and so violent! Mel is out of his mind in that movie. Although now we know he's just insane - he was very much in his mind.","I'm not into sports, and politics is kind of my sport. I love talking about it and debating it and getting into it. I also think people on both sides of the aisle have real exaggerated, incorrect views of the other side, and that is fascinating to me.","I am personally quite liberal.","My family is really into politics.","I'm pretty old-fashioned. I feel most people - and this is purely from observation; I'm not an expert - but I think most people want to get married, whatever one might say about the institution of marriage, especially if you are in a long relationship.","A good romantic comedy is my favorite movie to watch.","I think the best romantic comedies are hard funny - no soft jokes, but ones that make you, like, guffaw. I also think that they have to make you feel good, ideally, and make you feel warm inside at the end.","The two times I had nervous breakdowns in my life were when I graduated from college and had my first kid.","Comedy is my favorite genre. I think it often doesn't get the respect it deserves, and I think one of the reasons is there was a tradition in the past of comedy looking kind of brightly lit and like a sitcom.","The more real it is, the funnier it is. The more awkward it is, the more people are stumbly, the funnier it is. I like a sharp joke, but it has to say something that someone would actually say.","The frustrations and joys of parenthood are just hard to understand until you have a kid... the constant fight you're having with yourself, like loving being with your kid but also being kind of bored and wanting to look at your iPhone - it's kind of an interesting thing that's hard to write about before you've experienced it.","You just never know with movies how they'll be seen in a few years. You have no idea. Like, movies that were super popular when they came out have been forgotten. And other movies - and I put 'Sarah Marshall' in this - kind of weirdly stand the test of time a little bit.","R-rated comedies make as much money as PG-13. And I think the audiences wanna be shocked. Especially with comedy.","Basically, I always thought that if I had a movie that did well enough and warranted having a sequel, I would seriously entertain it because that's a huge blessing when that happens in your career.","As a moviegoer, I'm always annoyed when a big joke is ruined in the trailer, but generally, it actually makes it play better.","I've always had as many friends who are women as friends who are guys.","All of the things I've directed, I'm really emotionally close to. That's why I choose to direct them and spend years on them.","All movies are inherently collaborative, and animation even more so. There are hundreds and hundreds of people involved with an animated movie.","The worst thing you can do is animate something and then throw it out because it doesn't work story-wise."],"Nicholas Winton":["I work on the motto that if something's not impossible, there must be a way to do it.","Some people revel in taking risks, and some go through life taking no risks at all.","I wasn't heroic because I was never in danger.","Everyone thinks my story should be marked by heroism, but there was no risk to myself. You see, no-one in Prague at that time thought they were going to be at war with England.","I've always enjoyed doing work that intrudes, or helps people.","It gets a bit boring talking about the same thing for a hundred years.","I know crowds of people who go to church and the synagogue who aren't religious.","I respond very easily to outside events. One's life is a matter of chance. Nothing that you've arranged for yourself works out.","Ever since I was quite young, I was in St. John's Ambulance or the Red Cross; latterly, I've been involved in voluntary work with the mentally handicapped and Abbeyfield Old People's Homes."],"Nichole Hiltz":["I was always in love with film and becoming a character and playing something else, and nobody ever told me no, so I just followed it, and here I am, having a ton of fun."],"Nicholson Baker":["Wikipedia flourished partly because it was a shrine to altruism.","I no longer want to live in an apartment furnished with forklifts and backhoes.","For me, as a beginning novelist, all other living writers form a control group for whom the world is a placebo.","I was very shy and somewhat awkward. I studied too hard. And to have this exciting dorm life was a whole new thing.","Haven't you felt a peculiar sort of worry about the chair in your living room that no one sits in?","Until a friend or relative has applied a particular proverb to your own life, or until you've watched him apply the proverb to his own life, it has no power to sway you.","I really practiced hard and got to a certain level of technical proficiency. I overcame some of my limitations. I was a hard-working, dedicated bassoonist, but I have to say I'm not a natural musician.","Printed books usually outlive bookstores and the publishers who brought them out. They sit around, demanding nothing, for decades. That's one of their nicest qualities - their brute persistence.","From my music training, I knew that, some Spanish rhythms apart, 5/4 is a time signature used only in the modern era. Holst's Mars from the Planets is 5/4. But if you speak lines of poetry in that pattern you just end up hitting the off-beats. It's only when you add a rest - a sixth beat - that it sounds as it surely should sound.","Spoon the sauce over the ice cream. It will harden. This is what you have been working for.","Rarely do pens go dry in restaurants.","That was the problem with reading: you always had to pick up again at the very thing that had made you stop reading the day before.","Shoes are the first adult machines we are given to master.","I don't do all that well in the writerly world. I'm happier being outside the flow.","The music wasn't going to happen, and I realized I had read so little. I didn't know my way around any century. I was very under read.","I keep thinking I'll enjoy suspense novels, and sometimes I do. I've read about 20 Dick Francis novels.","When I really want to be soothed and reminded of why people bother to fiddle with sentences, I often read poetry.","Many good poets are really essayists who write very short essays.","E.B. White's essays are the best things I've read about Maine - especially the one in which he's not sure if he can go out sailing any more in his sloop.","I hadn't played any music since freshman year of college, more than thirty years ago, so I had to relearn everything. I started writing songs. Some were dance and trance songs (I listen to them a lot while I'm writing), and some were love songs, because that after all is what music is about - dancing and trancing and love and love's setbacks.","The nice thing about a protest song is that it takes the complaint, the fussing, the finger-pointing, and gives it an added component of sociable harmony.","You can register a political objection in a number of ways.","I ordered a Kindle 2 from Amazon. How could I not? There were banner ads for it all over the Web. Whenever I went to the Amazon Web site, I was urged to buy one.","I've never been a fast reader. I'm fickle; I don't finish books I start; I put a book aside for five, ten years and then take it up again.","True, the name of the product wasn't so great. Kindle? It was cute and sinister at the same time - worse than Edsel, or Probe, or Microsoft's Bob. But one forgives a bad name. One even comes to be fond of a bad name, if the product itself is delightful.","Maybe the Kindle was the Bowflex of bookishness: something expensive that, when you commit to it, forces you to do more of whatever it is you think you should be doing more of.","While I was writing I assumed it would be published under a pseudonym, and that liberated me: what I wrote was exactly what I wanted to read.","One's head is finite. You pour more and more things into it - surnames, chronologies, affiliations - and it packs them away in its tunnels, and eventually you find that you have a book about something that you publish.","First, if you love the Kindle and it works for you, it isn't problematic, and you should ignore all my criticisms and read the way you want to read.","There's a time and place for the Kindle, and I own one now and have books on it that I don't otherwise have. But I don't find that my hand reaches out for it the way it does for a trade paperback, or (in the middle of the night) for the iPod Touch.","I like shelves full of books in a library, but if all books become electronic, the task of big research libraries remains the same - keep what's published in the form in which it appeared.","I've always thought of myself as shy.","I blush easily. I have difficulty meeting people's eye, difficulty with public speaking, the normal afflictions of the shy, but not to a paralysing degree.","The great thing about novels is that you can be as unshy as you want to be. I'm very polite in person. I don't want to talk about startling or upsetting things with people.","I'm often called obsessive, but I don't think I am any more than anyone else.","So I really began as a failed poet - although when I first wanted to be a writer, I learned to write prose by reading poetry.","It's true that I don't rearrange that much in the fiction, but I feel if you change even one name or the order of one event then you have to call it fiction or you get all the credits of non-fiction without paying the price.","Wikipedia is just an incredible thing. It is fact-encirclingly huge, and it is idiosyncratic, careful, messy, funny, shocking and full of simmering controversies - and it is free, and it is fast.","I think I am done with Wikipedia for the time being. But I have a secret hope. Someone recently proposed a Wikimorgue - a bin of broken dreams where all rejects could still be read, as long as they weren't libelous or otherwise illegal."],"Nick Bantock":["One minute I was completely unknown, barely able to feed my family, living on pennies. The next minute, Katie Couric was interviewing me on the breakfast show.","I had never read in public, never given an interview. I was doing it all and trying to produce the next book and raise three young kids and had another child on the way.","I do what I want to do. I see where my enthusiasm is. Over the years, my techniques expanded. That's how the writing came out.","Growing up in England, people told you why you couldn't do things. Suddenly, I had a publisher banging on my door, and was given the creative green light to simply make."],"Nick Bostrom":["Traits acquired during one's lifetime - muscles built up in the gym, for example - cannot be passed on to the next generation. Now with technology, as it happens, we might indeed be able to transfer some of our acquired traits on to our selected offspring by genetic engineering.","Discovering traces of life on Mars would be of tremendous scientific significance: The first time that any signs of extraterrestrial life had ever been detected. Many people would also find it heartening to learn that we're not entirely alone in this vast, cold cosmos.","For healthy adult people, the really big thing we can foresee are ways of intervening in the ageing process, either by slowing or reversing it.","Nanotechnology has been moving a little faster than I expected, virtual reality a little slower.","I personally don't think of myself as either an optimist or a pessimist.","Once a discovery has been published, there is no way of un-publishing it.","There are some problems that technology can't solve."],"Nick Cannon":["Nobody can predict the future. You just have to give your all to the relationship you're in and do your best to take care of your partner, communicate and give them every last drop of love you have. I think one of the most important things in a relationship is caring for your significant other through good times and bad.","I think it takes a strong man to be in a relationship with a strong woman. A lot of people hear the word 'diva' and think of it as a negative. I see it as a positive. I want somebody who knows what they want out of life and isn't afraid to show it.","I think one of the most important things in a relationship is caring for your significant other through good times and bad.","To me, a forever love is a bond that can't be broken.","Mariah is a beautiful and talented person, and I've had a crush on her for as long as I can remember. Every day, my respect for Mariah continues to grow higher. She's a caring, warm and funny person. People have no idea how funny she is! I feel like I've always known she was my forever love.","My Vocation is my Vacation. I love what I do.","Saturday morning, you knew what was cool by what was on 'Soul Train.'","Even though I am fortunate to have certain luxuries, sometimes, I am even amazed by what people with money have and do. I want to remind people that just because you might be rich and famous, it doesn't mean you have to take yourself too seriously.","I always say that candy is the perfect studio food - it keeps your energy going.","I want to be there for my children. You want to make sure you're alive more than anything.","You have to be vigorous. That's the only way you are going to get it because everybody has dreams and everybody has goals, but the only people who achieve them are the ones that go after it and don't take no for an answer.","I just work - however people feel about it, I mean, at the end of the day, if I'm waiting for accolades, I could be waiting all my life, but I don't need that stuff to validate me. I just do what makes me happy.","It's fun having songs about parties and gigolos, but I really wanted to use my music as a form of art. Art is supposed to spark conversation and make people think, and I wanted to do that with this song.","Most aspiring child actors or child stars have a passion for it. But as easy as it is for me to say that I wouldn't put my kids in it, if I saw that they really, really wanted to do and they had the drive, then I would fully support it. As long as there's balance at home, then they could do whatever they wanted to do.","This is my chance to get out there and appease the fans of my music as well as show people that I do do standup comedy because a lot of people don't know that's where I started.","I'm not geeky but I have my geeky, corky moments, and then I've got some aspects of cool in me, I guess.","So my father was a person who never lied to me. If I had a question, he answered it. I knew a lot of things at a young age because I was intrigued.","Real men change diapers!","I think I'm actually built for fatherhood. I love to have a good time and play, but at the same time I've got a really serious side to me, and I think that's the balance you have to have. Get on your kids' level, but at any point in time, let them know who the parent is.","One thing about being a stand-up is it's a one-man show. You gotta do everything. You're the producer, writer, director, and the actor. You just gotta be out there and perform and give your all. It's such an honest form of art that it just taught me so much, and it kind of prepared me for manhood at an early age.","The people who truly love me and loved me before all of this stuff. You can't ever leave them behind.","Right now, I'm as single as a slice of American cheese.","I'm so into playing different characters, even when I was on Nickelodeon. I just observe.","I was 16 years old, driving to LA, and sleeping in my car, just trying to make it happen.","If you want to be in the automotive business, you go to Detroit, and you figure it out. If you want to be in entertainment, go to where it's at. Go to Hollywood, go to New York.","I was rapping at eight.","The only person I've worked with on my album was Kanye. And between the stuff that I've done and the stuff that he's assisted on and produced for me for this album, I don't even need anything else.","To be compared to Will Smith is probably one of the coolest things because that's who I came up admiring.","We are already expected to be the goodie two shoes. I went through that during my junior high schools where I wasn't allowed to watch television. I wasn't allowed to listen to the radio.","In the hip-hop community, it's about how real are you, or how strong can you be, and really my music just reflects me. If you can accept me, then you can accept my music.","There's so many people that follow the trend, and then it gets to a point where it gets a little stale. So, in music; I mean, whoever's the new trendsetter, that's who people follow.","The beautiful thing about acting is that you can just dive into the character, strip yourself of everything, and just get in there and perfect your craft.","People have always said I have an old soul, and all my best friends are 10 to 15 years my senior.","I am not worthy to be on a Mariah Carey record. She's a true artist, so I just step back and watch the genius occur.","Mariah's fashion game is definitely on a different level than mine. She actually knows Roberto Cavalli and Dolce & Gabbana. I didn't know those people actually existed; I thought they were just names.","Me personally, I wouldn't put my kids on television. But to each his own.","I want to affect culture. I want to have my mark on everything. I give examples of people like Bill Cosby, Quincy Jones - those are the people who I look up to. The game wouldn't be the same without them. What happens in the course of 5 years isn't really important to me. I care about what they'll say about me in 50 years.","Hunger is a deep concern of mine, and I feel that no one should go without food in this world as long as there are caring people to lend a hand. I've had to struggle in my past and I know what it's like to go without, so I try to do as much as I can to help bring awareness to an issue that hits very close to home for me.","People think that as a celebrity, you have to have this sort of mystique about you, but I'm probably the realest person you'll ever meet.","I was actually raised around a lot of children. So, I'm very comfortable around children.","I'm a musician. I play instruments. I dabble in the hip-hop field. That doesn't take vocal ability necessarily.","I am always the first to say that fame and entertainment is one of the best and easiest occupations to ever have, but one must know how to navigate through the matrix or you may find yourself in a very dark hole.","I've never been able to sky-dive, and I've always wanted to. I've probably done everything else, but for some reason the insurance company won't let me do it.","A lot of people don't know the first time I was ever on national television I was a 'Soul Train' dancer.","I think my kids give mommy more attention than they give me.","The thing I adore about Mariah the most is she's probably the most nurturing person I've ever met, like one of those spirits that walks into the room and wants to make sure that everybody's okay and taken care of. For someone to be at her status but be so concerned about others is really cool.","I tell people 'America's Got Talent' is the best summer job you could have - you get to watch people strive for their dreams all summer long. So when you see me rooting for these people or dancing on the side of the stage, that's what I'd be doing if I was watching this show at home!","I love 'Wild 'N Out' so much - one, because it's my baby, but also I get to see others succeed and go on to lead their own careers.","If I have a talent, it's already been exploited! I've shown everything I can do to the public.","Family is always first.","I like underground rappers - Cory Gunz is a young kid that's been really doing his thing. I'm a Gym Class Heroes type of fan even though they're not new, but they're definitely trendsetters.","Just speak yourself into existence. Whatever you want, speak it. You can see it.","A lot of the girls my age were impressed by silly stuff like money and fame. I wanted to be able to have intellectual and spiritual conversations with someone who was on the same page as me.","I am a hopeless romantic, and so is my wife.","I always try to be optimistic, but not to the point where I'm getting on people's nerves."],"Nick Carter":["As long as you're having fun and still doing stuff, it doesn't matter what other people think.","Live life to the fullest, for the future is scarce.","One of the most important things that I did to turn my life around was to realize and to accept that from this minute, that's all we have. Everything that happened behind us we cannot change so you might as well look to the future.","I used to try to draw my girlfriends. I think one of the most romantic things that anybody can do is draw a portrait of the person you love.","It's like Forrest Gump said, 'Life is like a box of chocolates.' Your career is like a box of chocolates - you never know what you're going to get. But everything you get is going to teach you something along the way and make you the person you are today. That's the exciting part - it's an adventure in itself.","I freak out if I go a little too long without being in the gym. For a long time it was all about getting the weight off because I was 240 pounds at my heaviest, and now I'm around 175, so the majority of that weight loss was due to diet and exercise.","I don't believe in being mean to anyone. I'm a really peaceful person. That's something I get from my family.","There was a ton of fighting between my mother and father. The kids would be thrown into the middle, to choose sides.","I wanted to be at my sister's funeral, but my family has always had a complicated dynamic.","I can be shy when I talk to women. I'm a shy dude.","I'm an old rock and roll buff. I love Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty.","It's kind of weird, because I look at myself as just a normal person. My friends get rejected all the time, so why shouldn't I? I don't think I'm anything special.","I try to be bad, but nobody will let me.","I try to make myself look as normal as possible because I like people to relate to me.","I don't want to die.","Fame is a lot of pressure, especially when you're responsible for your entire family. Financially, emotionally - everything.","I'm trying to make myself better. But I don't regret anything that I've gone through, because it makes me who I am.","With everybody that I've met, there's always been something I've learned about them that I like.","I never really am in awe of people because we are just equal at the end of the day.","As long as you know, within yourself, that you're no better than anyone else out there, you're OK.","I kind of consider myself a chameleon in music. I love all sorts of music.","The last person I'd date is some rich kid who's had everything handed to her on a plate. Give me a normal girl any day.","Everybody that I meet inspires me. You can learn so much from any person that you meet any day on the side of the street.","I remember pogs and sticky hands. I remember both. I wanted to get into pogs. I remember it was, like, all of a sudden it was here, then gone.","Without Ace of Base, I kind of feel Backstreet Boys would have never found their sound."],"Nick Cassavetes":["You just go in and try to do the best job you can everyday.","When your child is sick, you have tunnel vision.","Well, I think that people are smart enough to understand the difference between a movie and real life.","We do have a problem in this country. You can either make a movie and ignore that, or you can acknowledge it and say, this is the water that we're living in. You know this - the movie lives in this - it's centered around this particular problem, and I chose to acknowledge it.","My Mom and Dad did it pretty good, so I know it can work. The foremost thing I would say about working with Robin and Sean is that they were devoted to this project and devoted to their characters. You can't ask for any more from talented actors like that.","My daughter, when she was a week old, was diagnosed with congenital heart disease. For the past thirteen years, she's had four major heart surgeries. She's a candidate for - and must have - heart replacement surgery in order to have a long life.","I like to give my actors a lot of room."],"Nick Cave":["Getting married, for me, was the best thing I ever did. I was suddenly beset with an immense sense of release, that we have something more important than our separate selves, and that is the marriage. There's immense happiness that can come from working towards that.","A gentleman never talks about his tailor.","I'm very happy to hear that my work inspires writers and painters. It's the most beautiful compliment, the greatest reward. Art should always be an exchange.","I'm a big fan of teatowels and am always on the lookout for a good one.","Most of the time, feelings just seem to get in the way. They're a luxury for the idle, a bourgeois concept. Feelings are overrated.","If you look around, complacency is the great disease of your autumn years, and I work hard to prevent that.","People often can't separate, or can't understand, that to be funny is to be serious; it's a way of pulling people in and not scaring them off. I think a lot of the funny stuff, underneath it, there's a deep anxiety going on.","In getting older, I find myself becoming progressively more ineffectual in a lot of different ways, and part of that is down to no longer having the youthful feeling that what you're doing has any true impact.","I am not interested in anything that doesn't have a genuine heart to it. You've got to have soul in the hole. If that isn't there, I don't see the point.","Texting is apocalyptic on some level. It's a reduction of things.","'Inspiration' is a word used by people who aren't really doing anything.","An artist's duty is rather to stay open-minded and in a state where he can receive information and inspiration. You always have to be ready for that little artistic Epiphany.","Despite what people might think, I'm not interested in being dark all the time. I'm actually searching for some kind of light, and I'm always very happy when I can achieve that.","There's always pain around. That's one thing you can guarantee in life - there will always be a surplus of pain.","It's possible to get through life without a religious structure, but I don't think that's a very fruitful way to live.","If you took love out of the equation, I wouldn't know what else to write about.","Most people wait for the muse to turn up. That's terribly unreliable. I have to sit down and pursue the muse by attempting to work.","The blues is instilled in every musical cell that floats around your body.","The idea of songwriting is a transformative thing, and what I do with songwriting is take situations that are quite ordinary and transform them in some way. Apart from things like the murder ballads, the songs I write, at their core, are quite ordinary human concerns, but the process of writing about them transforms them into something else.","My music has to do with beauty, and it's intended to, if not lift the spirits, then be a kind of a balm to the spirits.","My muse is my wife. It's not some vague thing that flutters around the astrosphere or wherever it is. Sometimes as a songwriter you need something to hang a song on, to give it some kind of presence and form. For me, Susie is that.","Certainly being proficient in an instrument does have its problems. Because the better you get, the more you just start sounding like an ordinary guitarist. There are certainly guitarists that transcend that and do really find their sound and all that sort of stuff.","I don't think Hollywood makes many good films anymore. How many directors can you really trust to have an artistic vision, not a corporate vision or a watered-down communal one?","The rock star is dying. And it's a small tragedy. Rock stars have blogs now. I have no use for that kind of rock star.","I'm hugely self-critical in the morning.","There are methods to creating a mayhem that sounds different from your usual mayhem. Because mayhem and a heavy drum backbeat end up sounding like Green Day or something. But if you put a different beat within it to create some air and lightness, the chaos comes through better.","I don't feel I'm thrown around by the winds of taste and fashion.","I'm not religious, and I'm not a Christian, but I do reserve the right to believe in the possibility of a god.","The concept of God in America is very different than it is in England. Because we see the horrendous outcome of religion as being an American thing, in which the name of God has been hijacked by a gang of psychopaths and bullies and homophobes, and the name of God has been used for their own twisted agendas.","I love performing. I can get to be that person I always wanted to be - godlike.","My records are basically a litany of complaints against the world, and I'm quite like that in real life as well.","I know when I sit with my band members and we're playing back a song that we've done, I know that they're experiencing it in a completely different way and hearing stuff that they're alerted to because the way the interpret the world is through their ears. Mine is through my eyes.","The only person who can say they're happy getting old is someone who isn't actually old yet. Every day, I get less and less happy about that idea.","Musicians are at the bottom of the creative pyramid and authors are at the top, and many people think it's unacceptable for someone to attempt to jump from the bottom to the top of the pyramid.","I just want to leave this world with a massive catalog of songs.","When you're on your own, you have all the self-censorship that everybody has when they try and write. All the little voices that say, 'No, you can't write that, what will they think of that?'","It's always a pleasure on a personal note for me to come back to Australia.","Writing is a necessary thing for me, just to keep myself level. It has beneficial effects on my life.","I lost my innocence with Johnny Cash. I used to watch the 'Johnny Cash Show' on television in Wangaratta when I was about 9 or 10 years old. At that stage I had really no idea about rock n' roll. I watched him, and from that point I saw that music could be an evil thing - a beautiful, evil thing.","I'm not saying this in a condescending kind of way, but it's quite simple: The making of America was a heroic thing. Australia has a much murkier, much more complex view of its history. It's just full of all these open wounds we don't really know what to do with.","After a while, you just don't do things you don't wanna do - that's the great freedom you get, the older you get. You learn what to do and what not to do, and what will be a waste of time and what won't be a waste of time.","The big problem with songwriting for me is starting a new song. It's the thing where all the anguish exists, not in the writing of the song, but the starting of the new song.","There's an element to songwriting that I can't explain, that comes from somewhere else. I can't explain that dividing line between nothing and something that happens within a song, where you have absolutely nothing, and then suddenly you have something. It's like the origin of the universe.","Personally I find the story of Christ incredibly moving.","When you're talking about rock n' roll, myth-making is what it's all about.","No, I wouldn't direct a movie, no. I couldn't. I don't have the patience for it, I don't have the people skills. You have to be clever. I'm not really clever in that kind of way. And you have to be able to manipulate people, but at the same time allow them to feel like they are manipulating you, to get the kind of movie that you want.","You write a scene, and it works or it doesn't. It's immediate.","At the end, we're kind of observers - creative people, I mean. I feel like an observer, and I'm pretty much able to step out of things and see how things are playing out.","I've spent my life butting my head against other people's lack of imagination.","The work ethic at art school is completely different than the work ethic amongst people who get into music. People who paint, it's an honorable thing to spend all day and all night in front of your canvas - that is the romantic vision of the painter.","I don't have any authority to talk about the domestic policies of America. But as an outsider, I am mystified by the fact that you are encouraged to buy a gun, but if you use it for the purpose that it is expressly designed for, you get the death penalty. That aspect of America is kind of mystifying.","It's an Australian thing to be dismissive. We find that endearing. Americans don't. They believe what you say.","I write a lot, and very often I write a couple of lines that are particularly revealing in some kind of way. And then as a few more lines get added and a piece gets added, eventually the song pretty much takes over and you can't really find a way to change those things.","People think I'm a miserable sod but it's only because I get asked such bloody miserable questions.","I'm a believer. I don't go to church. I don't belong to any particular religion, but I do believe in God. I couldn't write what I write about and be creative without a certain form of belief.","At some point you start seeing the difference between what you really want, and what is your priority order. I feel that today I know what I want. That's the problem with perspective, as well as focus and concentration.","I've always had an obligation to creation, above all.","I love rock-n-roll. I think it's an exciting art form. It's revolutionary. Still revolutionary and it changed people. It changed their hearts. But yeah, even rock-n-roll has a lot of rubbish, really bad music.","To my undying shame, I do read reviews. I don't read them all, but I like to get some kind of idea how things are going.","If beautiful movies can influence you to go out and hug your children, then we have to be honest and say that other movies can inspire you to do bad things.","A rock musician's career is short-lived. To extend it, you need to do other things to keep yourself fresh.","Writing screenplays makes me a better musician because it clears my head. After writing a movie, I go running back to music as fast as I can.","I've always been at war with the guitar. All vocalists are fighting a war with the electric rhythm guitar.","L.A. is full of screenwriters. I don't know why. On many levels, it's such a thankless occupation.","I used to believe that if I could do certain things - write a book or be a successful musician - that I'd be transformed into a happy person, but it doesn't work that way.","One of my big fears is drying up, and the more I create, the more I feel myself shrinking beneath the backlog of work I've done.","With writing a song, I've always felt, right from the start, like I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel. I don't ever feel there's a font of ideas to fall back on.","Guns are part of the American psyche, aren't they? This is collateral damage for having a Wild West mentality. It's intrinsic to the American psyche. It's never going to change.","I've always felt like an imposter, in the whole, as a musician.","I always thought my records were number one; it's just the charts didn't think so.","Kylie Minogue is the greatest thing that has happened to Australian music.","My father was a teacher and my mother also worked in the school, so the family has a background in education.","I don't really do Japanese interviews. I don't think there's much call for me in Japan.","Most screen violence is tedious.","Songwriting, I have to take myself away from everybody to do. It's an unsightly act.","Accessible local libraries are vital to communities and to children.","I won't go into the details, but I ready myself for the day. I am a high-maintenance type of guy.","If I'm hanging around too much, my wife and kids say, 'Hey, why don't you go downstairs and start a new novel?'","People are always surprised to see clues to my being a normal kind of guy. As if I'm somehow letting the team down.","Songs you can dip in and out of, but a book... well, it can overpower you.","The more settled I've become, the more problematic my characters have become. There was a period when I wrote sensitive and gentle songs and these came at a time when life was at its most destructive. I think you write about what you need, on some level.","Self-editing is the way I write. Ten verses of a song and it's finished. Then we start playing it and if I see that it's too long, I'll start cutting.","I became a script writer with absolutely no idea of how to write a script whatsoever. I still feel a bit of an outsider in that regard. If I can maintain that approach to screenwriting, it can continue to be enjoyable.","I consider myself to be first and foremost a comic writer. The way I entertain myself - especially in those long and grim hours in the office - is to write stuff I find funny.","I don't write happy songs. Who does? I don't know anybody who writes happy songs, really.","The more information you have, the more human our heroes become and consequently the less mysterious and godlike. They need to be godlike.","As Australians, we see the law as inherently bad. We have a real inherent distaste for authority in our makeup.","The songs that I like are the ones that you can't visualize, that are just cries from the heart - those very straight, direct songs that make rock & roll music so wonderful.","I'm not in the business of telling people what to do. I'm much more in the business of describing things, situations and stuff like that and leaving them out there, and you can make up your minds about them.","What you're really after when you see a film or listen to a song is a singular vision, and I'm not sure how much of that you really get in Hollywood.","Early on I realized when you write a song about someone, it flatters them on some level, and gives you a lot of room to move within a relationship. A song can kind of get the girl, for sure.","I've always hated narrative songs. I hate those songs where, basically, it's an unfolding of a story.","I think it's a part of us as human beings that we search outside of ourselves for meaning.","The band is a living, breathing thing. It grows in the same way we do as human beings and if it doesn't, it dies. It's important to feed the organism, and one way of doing that is to set musical challenges that keep it alive.","The problem with books, now that I've written one, is that the idea of adaptation is so much easier than sitting down to write something new.","When you're making a film, there are so many people involved that you get opinions and notes from people and you don't even know who they are. I find that quite difficult and it wears you down.","I've watched 'Oprah Winfrey.' And I'm proud. I don't care what anybody says! I don't know whether I've watched it. I've been in the room while it's been on.","I'm a kind of hard-wired pessimist. I can't help but see the world in a certain kind of way.","When I perform onstage, I'm actually kind of nearsighted, so I don't have any real, true understanding of what the audience is like.","I was reading The Bible a lot through my 20s, mostly the Old Testament, just because I was knocked out by the language and the stories. I felt that the God being talked about there, who was this insane, vindictive patriarch - it was kind of thrilling, and titillated something in me at the time.","I see it as my duty in some way is to be out in the world as an Australian putting forward what I consider to be authentic Australian music.","I'm kind of old-school and love nothing more than sitting, opening a book, and reading it. But I also love listening to audio books.","At school I was an anti-magnet for women.","I write hate lyrics really well. It's not every day you can use them, really.","Everything that's said against me offends me, whether it's true or not.","I've always worn suits. To me they're a very practical kind of thing to wear. You put one on and don't really have to think about what you're going to wear.","I'm not a misogynist, so you can dispense with that. I think I've done wonders for the feminist movement.","I get criticized for a lot of what I write about, but as far as I'm concerned I'm actually standing up and having a look at what goes on in the minds of men, and I have the authority to talk about it because I'm a man.","I have a very strange relationship in general with women around my music. There's some that understand it and some that think there should be a law against it.","Look, when I look back, from 20 onwards, I was actually having a pretty good time, I have to say.","The idea of acting is something that absolutely repulses me. I just can't do it. I'm terrible at it. I get roped into films every now and then, and it's always a disaster.","What I'm resistant to is the 'Walk the Line' biopic, where you have this redemptive life done in two hours. It just doesn't wash with me. I've been there and things don't work out that way.","I love being manipulated by what I see. I love weepies and romantic comedies where you're reaching for the Kleenex at the right moment.","I have a particular dislike for children's films. I'm way past the novelty aspect.","If you're Australian, you feel it in your bones because you're at odds with everybody else, except other Australians, in the sense that people always seem to be behaving strangely. People always seem to be behaving the wrong way, in a different way. You say things and there are silences.","I don't know, maybe Australian humour isn't supposed to be funny. It's as dry as the Sahara, and I think people miss that.","I have an armchair interest in gardening, but I don't like to get my knees dirty. I don't have a garden.","I suspect the older you get the more invisible you become.","Moving to the country is a very bold thing to do. You can have vague romantic notions about doing that, but in actuality, it can be a terrifying thing.","The guitar is something you kind of embrace, and the piano is something you kind of - when you play it, you sort of push it away. It feels very different.","Most of my ideals and stuff really come from my mother.","To me, I don't write when I'm depressed. If I'm depressed, which is actually rare, I'm not doing anything, you know, and I'm not able to do anything.","You can't trust an artist that just makes good records.","Film seems to be a medium designed for betrayal and violence.","I'm an Australian, and when I grew up much of my influences were American - blues music and country music, all that sort of thing.","Being a parent can make you a horrible person at times, because you're pushed to the limit constantly.","I'm not someone who's particularly in touch with the way they feel. I've heard it said that you should be a 'human being' not a 'human doing', but I'm a human doing, very much so.","The last thing I ever wanted to get involved with is Hollywood. The way it works is that people get an idea you could possibly do something, but there's a one-in-a-hundred chance that it could get made.","When I'm singing 'Deanna,' for example, which I sing pretty much every night, it brings forward a kind of imagined, romanticized lie about this particular person, which I find really comforting and exciting to sing about.","I would hate to think my songs were giving advice to people.","Some people, myself in particular, have an adversarial relationship with the camera, and it sprouts up in every photograph.","The big problem with songwriting for me is starting a new song. It's the thing where all the anguish exists, not in the writing of the song, but the starting of the new song. What do I write about? I never know."],"Nick Clegg":["The UK is not going to leave the European Union. Of course not. We are inextricably wound up with Europe. In terms of culture, history and geography, we are a European nation.","For far too long the world's poorest people have seen no benefit from the vast natural resources in their own backyards. It is time to end the injustice where ordinary people are silent witnesses, left to suffer without basic services, as the profits from their countries' assets are hidden and plundered by corrupt regimes.","I say this as a young dad seeing children going into primary school: I don't think we should underestimate the formative effect on a child of those first years in primary school.","If the euro zone doesn't come up with a comprehensive vision of its own future, you'll have a whole range of nationalist, xenophobic and extreme movements increasing across the European Union. And, frankly, questions about the British debate on EU membership will just be a small sideshow compared to the rise of political populism.","One thing I have frankly decided is that when it comes to political reform we have two conservative parties in British politics. Both the Labour and Conservative parties have constantly and repeatedly failed to honour promises they have made about reforming, cleaning, modernising our clapped-out system.","I am quite strict as a dad but I don't want to be censorious.","One of the big changes in politics has been because families, individuals, have felt worried, insecure... worried about the economy, worried about their jobs, worried about their kids' futures... actually the disconnect between the public and media discourse and people's everyday concerns has become bigger not smaller.","The Liberal Democrat Party and the Conservative Party come at things very differently when it comes to Europe. When it comes to political reform, we have a much greater tradition in the Liberal Democrats of social justice and fairness than the Conservatives do.","When I became leader, I made very clear I was not going to choose the easy life. I have always taken risks. I don't like comfort-zone politics.","Joining the Liberal Party was a no-brainer for me... And when you are a young man, you don't get a calculator out saying, 'Am I going to get to power?' You get propelled forward by idealism.","Actually, the curious thing is that the more you become a subject of admiration or loathing, the more you're examined under a microscope, the distance seems to open up between who you really are and the portrayals that people impose on you.","We have got to make sure there is proper independent scrutiny and accountability for people in the press, just as there should be in any other industry where things go wrong. But let's not try and think it is for politicians or governments to tell people what they stick in newspapers. That is deeply illiberal.","We need to teach our kids, because there is such a celebrity culture at the moment, that however rich you are, however famous you are, however glamorous you are, everyone has to live by the same rules.","With the EU taking in ten more countries and adopting a new Constitution, organisations need more than ever intelligent professional help in engaging with the EU institutions.","We need to reach out to small 'l' liberal voters who have a modern outlook on life, who want a party that is hard-headed on the economy - more credible on the economy than Labour - but more socially progressive and fairer than the Conservatives.","The caricature of what George Osborne is doing on the fiscal side is absurd. If you read some of the commentary, particularly from the left, you would think he was turning the clock back to the 1930s.","The Conservative Party is not honouring the commitment to Lords reform and, as a result, part of our contract has now been broken. Clearly I cannot permit a situation where Conservative rebels can pick and choose the parts of the contract they like, while Liberal Democrat MPs are bound to the entire agreement.","I will not accept a new wave of fiscal retrenchment, of belt-tightening, without asking people at the top to make their contribution, to make an additional contribution. I don't think you can ask people on middle and low incomes, who, after all, are the vast majority of the British population, to bear the brunt of this adjustment.","Most people in this country are very fair-minded; they understand we're in the middle of a very difficult journey of repairing, rescuing, restoring our British economy, and they want us, and they want particularly Liberal Democrats in government, to fight for the fairest possible way of doing that.","Grown-up politicians talk to each other across party lines. Over the last few weeks I have had lengthy conversations with Ed Miliband, David Miliband, with Tony Blair, with Peter Mandelson... talking about Europe, talking about political reform.","Do I get up every morning and ask: am I doing the things that I believe in and am I doing them for the best possible motives? Yes. Unambiguously yes.","You have a political and media elite who have an idiom by which they describe politics. It's highly, highly polarised. It's right, left, red, blue, up, down, victorious, crushed.","My dad's side of the family had lots of artists and musicians. There's an emotional, quite sentimental quality to Slavic culture. It's very open, it loves art, it loves music, it loves literature. It's very warm, it's very up, it's very down. I would celebrate that.","I don't want to clip on the armour every morning. I've seen some politicians do this and they get a bit mangled and bitter. I just refuse to do that. I refuse to be angry or bitter or complain, and I remain open. I may sometimes be a bit too open but I'm not going to change that one bit.","I'm very lucky. I am one of those people who is able to go home, shut the front door and completely focus on the kids.","If you scratch below the surface and ask what really makes me tick, it's the liberalism of trying to promote freedom and opportunity. Promoting social mobility is one of the keys to that.","I totally accept that it's a legitimate criticism that when you are involved in the day-to-day scrum of government... that what can get lost is the narrative, the hymn sheet... the song that inspires and lifts people's sights.","I've just been away for a week, and I dropped my BlackBerry in the sea while I was messing around with the kids, so no one can reach me. Blissful. I heartily recommend it.","Politics is a highly tribal business.","The Labour Party has become consumed by collective bile towards... the Liberal Democrats. That portrays a rather nasty arrogance.","I didn't become leader to transform the Liberal Democrats into an enlarged form of the Electoral Reform Society. It's not the be all and end all for us. There are other very, very key ambitions in politics, not least social mobility and life chances, that I care about as passionately if not more.","If there's one thing I'm not going to apologise for as the leader of the Liberal Democrats in government after 60 or 70 years of being out of government, it's that you just cannot avoid but deal with the world the way it is.","I don't even pretend we can occupy the Lib Dem holier-than-thou, hands-entirely-clean-and-entirely-empty-type stance. No, we are getting our hands dirty, and inevitably and totally understandably we are being accused of being just like any other politicians.","One thing I've very quickly learned is that if you wake up every morning worrying about what's in the press, you would go completely and utterly potty.","I think that the days when newspaper barons could basically click their fingers and governments would snap to attention have gone.","Tony Blair and Gordon Brown committed to John Major's spending envelopes in 1997. No-one said that Tony Blair and John Major were identical. This happens quite often that parties actually, despite all the sound and fury, agree on the overall need to make sure that we live within our means as a country.","Our Sheffield and London homes are worth well over a million but the bank owns most of them - we are mortgaged up to the gills.","I don't lead a particularly Bohemian existence. The main criterion for me is not to be judgemental of other people so long as what they do is not harmful or offensive to others.","I wish more people knew that the only one of the three main parties where not a single MP flipped from one property to the next, and not a single MP avoided capital-gains tax, where every single London MP did not claim a penny of second-home allowance, was the Liberal Democrats.","Liberalism is a really old British tradition and it has a completely different attitude towards the individual and the relationship between the individual and the state than the collectivist response of Labour, and particularly Old Labour, does.","I have got instincts that, I think, are very much in tune with people's very keen sense to see something different. I did not dream of being in politics since I was knee-high to a grasshopper. I was not involved in student politics, or not in that partisan way.","Although I am a young leader, I actually came to it strangely quite late. I have a different perspective, partly because of my family, partly because of what I did for ten years: negotiating trade deals, working out in Central Asia doing assistance projects.","Any government, of whatever composition, needs to mobilise opinion way beyond its own ranks in order to do the difficult things that it does.","We can't return to the 19th century, draw up our drawbridges and say, we don't have anything to do with each other, Germany will not work with the Netherlands, the UK will not work with France. That's ludicrous. We are condemned to work with each other.","What we should be doing in the EU as a whole is more economic integration in the single market, rather than less.","I don't watch a huge amount of telly. I read a lot. I'm reading at the moment 'Freedom,' by Jonathan Franzen, a great big brick of a book, and I'm loving it.","I am a passionate believer in freedom of speech. I would not support anything which would impinge on aggressive robust freedom of the British press, but when things go wrong and there has been outright illegality, there should be proper accountability.","The choices politicians make must be based on values - not an arbitrary, axe-wielding approach to public spending or a dismal exchange between Gordon Brown and David Cameron about percentages that sounds like an argument between different book-keepers.","We are keen to stress that a strong euro zone is good for a strong United Kingdom. It's not for us to write the changes that the euro zone needs to embark on.","Most of what needs to be changed in the euro zone can be done without treaty changes. The demand for treaty change is as political as it is legal and I don't think it's going to happen soon.","You've got some very powerful countries: Poland, the United Kingdom, Sweden and others who have a genuine desire to see the euro zone straighten itself out. It's good for all of us, whether you're in the euro zone or not, to make sure that it doesn't lead to a fracturing.","What I hope is in five years' time, I can go to the British people in the election and say: Lots of you doubted that coalition politics worked, but it has worked.","Voters tell politicians what they want through the ballot box. Constantly second-guessing them by speculating whether the parties should gang up on each other misses the point.","My head spins. One moment I'm told I'm too edgy, then people say I'm too angry, then that I show too much passion... make your minds up.","The British political system and the whole clapped out Westminster architecture, and the language that we use about politics, it's completely unsustainable. You either decide to be part of that transition to do something different. Or you cling to old certainties.","I would be open about the fact that, clearly, politicians should be able to speak to each other. David Cameron doesn't seem to accept this, but if the British people have voted then of course you have to try and provide good stable government.","Liberal Democrats in government will not follow the last Labour government by sounding the retreat on the protection of civil liberties in the United Kingdom. It continues to be essential that our civil liberties are safeguarded, and that the state is not given the powers to snoop on its citizens at will."],"Nick Clooney":["We didn't defeat the Nazis by becoming Nazis.","Our nest eggs, no matter how small, are safe.","No matter how many troops we have in place or how long they stay, we cannot impose a parliamentary democracy there any more than the insurgents can impose a theocracy.","Conventional wisdom holds that setting a timetable for getting American troops out of Iraq would be a mistake.","The kind of Iraq that emerges from all of this is ultimately out of our hands.","Perhaps our Irish friends should not so completely turn their backs on their historical dishes, no matter how many jokes they might have to endure.","Our actions in the Middle East over the last 15 years have already guaranteed radical Muslims quite enough ammunition to kill Americans for the next century, even if Guantanamo did not exist.","We don't defeat evil by becoming evil.","The worst thing that can happen to us in an ideological struggle is to become what we are fighting.","America has faced much more difficult times, including potential national extinction, without flinching.","The quality that defines us as Americans is the courage to respond to being hit. The courage to root out and destroy the killers. And, most importantly, the courage to hold on to our values and protect our hard-won freedoms while doing it.","It is impossible to exaggerate the wide, and widening, gulf between the American attitude on the Iraq war and the view from our friends across the Atlantic.","America, the temple of invention and industry, doesn't make things anymore.","One of the pleasant duties of America's most famous announcers during the relatively short swing era of the big bands was to host late-night remotes from some of the most famous ballrooms throughout the country.","In matters large and small, many people seemed concerned about churlishness, an ugliness in our relationships that appears to be increasing rather than decreasing.","Social Security is at last on the nation's front burner.","In my opinion, the president is right to address future funding, even though Social Security will show a surplus through 2018 and will not run out of funds until 2042.","It is statesmanlike for the administration and Congress to look to our nation's welfare beyond their terms in office.","A salute from this corner to President Bush for saying he was willing to investigate raising or eliminating the cap on salaries subject to the Social Security tax.","Currently, 94 out of 100 of us pay the Social Security tax all year round.","We like to believe that, in our lifetime, the human condition is improving.","As I listened, it occurred to me that interest in and affection for the animals that share the planet with us may be a more unifying force than any other.","Those who actually hate animals to the point of being cruel to them are outcasts to the rest of us, no matter where in the world they live.","Respect and affection for animals, particularly those who share our homes, recognize no geographic borders.","Whatever its other limitations, the Big Apple and those who live there make room for their dogs and cats, take good care of them and abide by the rules made necessary by a huge population.","We decided that how we react to and treat those fellow mortals, wild and domestic, tells us more about ourselves than, perhaps, some of us want to know.","What the F.D.I.C. does is to put the full faith and credit of the United States government behind every savings account in the nation, up to a limit that has changed over the years and stands now at $100,000.","In economic panics throughout history, the wiping out of the savings accounts of lower earners and the middle class has often led to social revolution, sometimes violent upheavals.","When runaway inflation and bank failures struck in Germany in the 1920s, the middle class was destroyed, which led directly to the rise of the Nazis.","For some reason, on that sparkling afternoon last week, I actually saw the coal that was passing by and it set me to thinking how important coal was to our everyday lives when I was a little boy."],"Nick Cummins":["The universe works in crazy ways. Your good luck will come in waves, and so does your bad, so you have to take the good with the bad and press forward.","You never say never. There's always a chance to do things in the future.","I like to get in the mindset of the honey badger when I go into contact. There's no doubts, no fears. If you can do that as a human, you're killin' it.","You don't give yourself a nickname unless you're bloody struggling.","One of the stories that inspires me is that it is documented that a honey badger killed a lion in a one-on-one.","At training, I consider myself a bit of a morale booster. I take a pack of lollies just to boost the boys' morale. I see that as crucial. I try and be a good influence and keep a high energy.","If you're a single Sheila and you're trying to find an Australian bloke, you duck off down there to Australia. You go to the Red Centre: you'll find there's a few shearers, a few stockmen, and there you will find an Australian bloke.","Every man's got to find themselves, and I found myself in bloody Western Australia, of all places - there was as far away as I could.","I'd love to go to the Olympics. I grew up watching it on TV, and I was always very patriotic and passionate watching that. I'd like to give that back to my country, but I know I can't just walk into the side.","The hair on this melon, there's nothing special going on there - trust me - other than a bit of Head and Shoulders, of course. It's a 100 percent bog-standard do.","The more nature and stuff, the better. The source of our power comes from nature, and the closer to nature you are, the more you can power up.","I reckon you have to put a presence in front of your opponent - a bit of confidence and attitude - and then you can change what their next move may be.","Growing up, I was like any Aussie kid - you know we love our sport - that was my favourite subject at school. That is a subject, right?","Sometimes it can be difficult when you're talking to a journo after the game, saying, 'Yeah mate, I was on the burst.' And then the translator is trying to translate that into Japanese, and apparently there is no actual translation.","Inside every man, there's a yearning to express your wild side.","Every experience you can get adds to you; it really adds to the mental side of things, too.","Everyone has their own mission in life and what they've got to do. You can't knock them for it. There's always a lot going in people's lives.","Most people travel outside of Australia. They don't realise what we've got.","The quoll is like the Australian version of the honey badger. It's a little mongrel that gets around and is pretty fierce and will take on a few things. You don't want to get that in your campsite.","In Sevens, fitness is crucial, and it's going to come down to how quickly my body gets in shape.","I remember, the first time I gave Dad a proper hug, it was big.","Everyone has their own mission in life and what they've got to do. You can't knock them for it. There's always a lot going on in people's lives.","When my brother was four years old and I was four months, we were the same weight.","Family's number one; just, that's flat out it, and I think a lot of people, when they're put in a certain position, will come to that conclusion, and you'll just do whatever.","Give them a big hug. He's your old man - why is it so hard?"],"Nick D'Aloisio":["My first app was released in July or August of 2008. It was a 'fingermill' - a treadmill for your fingers. My level of programming was quite basic to begin with, so it was more gimmicky to start with. Day one it was up there, I had 79 pounds worth of revenue.","There is a generation of skimmers. It's not that they don't want to read in-depth content, but they want to evaluate what the content is before they commit time. Especially on a mobile phone - you don't have the phone, or cellular data, or screen size to be reading full-length content.","One thing I'd like to do is angel investing in small companies. That's what's exciting, and if you are lucky to have a bit of money, you can take those risks.","I was using Twitter a lot on my phone, and was realising there was a massive gap between the link on the tweet and the full story. If you could come up with a summary layer to show in Twitter, that would be awesome.","I like playing sport. I'm a bit of a design enthusiast, and like spending time with my girlfriend and mates.","I thought of the idea of Summly in March or April 2011. I was 15 years old and I was revising for some kind of history exam. The problem was I was trying to find information that was useful to me. When you type into Google an esoteric term, you get quite a lot of stuff that's not relevant.","I put together an iPhone app called TrimIt and released that in July 2011. About a month later, the private fund of the Hong Kong billionaire Li-Kashing cold emailed me and expressed an interest to invest, but they didn't realize I was 15. They thought it was a U.K. company with a team.","The App Store has democratized the creation of content. As a 12-year-old kid, I was able to put my application on the store. No one knows who's behind the screen so you can't tell I'm a 12-year-old.","My motivation has always been to do technology apps and companies, not making money. Just because the money's come, nothing's changed.","Yahoo to me, as the founder of a company, is one of the biggest opportunities you could have; it's one of those classic Internet companies.","It's the scale that Yahoo brings - and that user base - that I really want to build products for."],"Nick Davies":["I've learnt that your life is more interesting and fulfilling when you don't lead it in a straight line and you go off on zigzags. I've made it a rule that if life becomes too comfortable and easy, I'll disrupt it.","In my case, I got hit a lot by bullies when I was a child, and so I naturally bristle against anybody who abuses power. And that seems to make me rather persistent when it comes to exposing the abuse of power.","Notoriously, in 1975, Murdoch abused his position as a newspaper owner to support a plot that ousted the democratically elected prime minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam, who had dared to wander away from the mogul's path.","The effect of climate change is not simply to reduce rain during the summer months, but also to increase the number of torrential storms. When the rain falls that hard and fast, it cannot sink into the ground and go down to the aquifers.","The vast bulk of Murdoch's news output, including the huge majority of any falsehood and distortion, is simply the spontaneous product of his highly commercialised newsrooms. It sells.","The U.S. dropped more high explosives on Vietnam than the Allies used on Germany and Japan together in the Second World War.","It is an odd thing about newspapers that they live by exposure, yet they keep their own worlds concealed.","The friends of tabloid newspapers often point out that their journalism exists only because millions of people pay money to read it.","Back in the 1980s, the 'News of the World' had specialised in digging into the privacy of criminals. In the 1990s, enriched by the excavation of Princess Diana's volatile life, they had widened their work to mine the activities of any celebrity, any public figure.","A trial deals with only a limited amount of information, considering only the evidence which is available and also admissible and which relates directly to the charges on the indictment.","In a film muddied by fictional detail, the new Spielberg production Fifth Estate's portrayal of the Guardian's work with Wikileaks is accurate in describing the running dispute between journalists who wanted to redact documents to make them safe and Julian Assange, who wanted no such restraint.","The death of the MG marks the end of one of the most perfect products of free enterprise, born out of the voracious will to succeed of one man and the burgeoning market for middle-class status symbols. The car first appeared as a souped-up Morris Oxford in 1923 when it won the Land's End Rally.","Julian Assange is self-consciously an individual. He thinks in his own way, primarily as a physicist, having studied pure maths and physics at university in Australia where he grew up.","Once, the world was full of mysteries, some of them frightening, some of them wonderful, some of them merely fascinating. Now, it can be a banal and predictable place, the tracks of daily life so well-beaten and defined, our culture awash with the imbecile obvious, our existence suffocating in safety. But mysteries remain.","On first acquaintance, the mystery of the Mayans of Guatemala can seem simply bizarre, as it was when I first encountered Maximon the god.","Something very worrying has been going on at Scotland Yard. We now know that in dealing with the phone-hacking affair at the 'News of the World,' they cut short their original inquiry; suppressed evidence; misled the public and the press; concealed information and broke the law. Why?","The Murdoch-owned 'Sunday Times' has an appalling history of involvement in illegal activity. And it's because they're Sunday papers; they're trying to get scoops that the dailies haven't got.","You don't get shouted at at the 'Guardian.' Nobody bullies you at the paper; nobody tells you what to write. Now, I love working in that atmosphere; I am free to research and write what I want.","It's the tabloids, with their intense commercial need to get scoops to bring in readers, that run a regime of fear, where reporters are bullied, shouted at. That's where things go wrong.","I spent two years working on building sites, working on the railways as a guard and in a racing stable, exercising racehorses. I learnt to build relationships. The experience of not being stuck in some middle-class bubble taught me things that being at university hadn't.","Reporters have to use their imagination, really put themselves in the shoes of the person they want to interview."],"Nick Dempsey":["People who learn to windsurf, they're in it for life. It never gets boring. It's always different, amazing, exciting. It's such a wonderful feeling when you're ripping through the waves, feeling weightless.","Going to the Olympic Games is the greatest experience anybody could have, and you just don't want to let yourself down.","The reality is being an Olympic windsurfer is bloody hard work, and it is a huge commitment.","My dad had a board, and my older brothers windsurfed. I just wanted to do what my brothers did. I was seven, I think, and I was like, 'Can I go, can I go, can I go?,' and I've never turned back.","As an athlete, my first Olympic experience was Sydney 2000. I remember seeing people getting medals, and I thought, 'Wow, that's where I want to be.'"],"Nick Denton":["Henry Blodget does occasionally have a new idea. If you're making a point about aggregation or the emptiness of modern journalism, he's far from the best target. Try Huffpo - or Gawker writers whose souls have been corroded by irony.","An employer would be a complete fool to let an image like college partying influence their hiring decisions.","You could argue that as web audiences have grown larger and advertisers have demanded scale, the web has dumbed down - like the mainstream media we so mocked.","I have to come to terms with the paternalism of American business. Companies are expected to take on so many social responsibilities which are the province of the state in Europe.","I think straight couples have a schedule: You're together for two years and then there's the 'where is this going?' question, which wouldn't necessarily be good for everyone, but I think it's pretty healthy for relationships, for there to be a presumption that there is a decision to be made.","Most good media come out of somebody saying, 'This should exist; this is something I want to read.'","Forget about someone's resume or how they present themselves at a party. Can they blog or not? The blog doesn't lie.","Google and others truncate headlines at 70 characters. On the Manti Teo story, Deadspin's scoop fell down the Google search results, overtaken by copycat stories with simpler headlines. Deadspin's headline was 118 characters. Vital information - 'hoax' - was one of the words that was cut off.","Google demotes search results that don't get clicked on.","Is there Gawker ethics? I mean, I guess there's Gawker ethics. It's a dangerous thing to talk about.","My background is economics and maths. I think one of the reasons I studied humanities at all, or even went into journalism, is because, like, science and maths wasn't cool in England when I was growing up. No one ever talked to the engineering students at Oxford.","I think people are sort of waking up to it now, how probably the biggest change in Internet media isn't the immediacy of it, or the low costs, but the measurability. Which is actually terrifying if you're a traditional journalist, and used to pushing what people ought to like, or what you think they ought to like.","I've never really understood people who climb socially by sucking up. It seems like the least efficient way to climb, and also the most psychologically debilitating.","I regret the stories we didn't do - the stories that we knew about and talked about but didn't have all of, so didn't publish. The whole idea of Gawker was to remove the barrier between the thought and the talk - and the page.","The idea of harnessing the intelligence of the readership has been lost in the quest for Facebook likes. For many, readers have become synonymous with hateful commenters. It's time for a renewed push to realize some of the original dreams of the web.","I don't really mind playing tabloid monster. I always liked those characters in the old movies.","There was a rivalry - and some pie-throwing. But that was probably because Gawker and Radar had more in common than they wanted to admit. Each was the other's future. Radar served up the exclusives I always envied. Gawker was actually comfortable on the web, in the medium Radar should have made its own.","You know how the best story angles often spring from that thought you have on reading an article or watching a show - that thought you have before the responsible journalist in you comes up with something boring. I usually recommend people get in touch with their deep 'reptilian brain.'","The original idea of blog publishing was that writer and reader would be on the same level. That it would be a conversation - not a lecture. People lost sight of that. We didn't. Kinja is designed to break down the walls of the ghettos. So that everybody - editor, writer, source, subject, expert, fan - can be a contributor.","Jonah Peretti is one of the smartest web publishers out there. And Buzzfeed is an aggressive and dynamic company.","Ben Smith's quick-hit campaign 'scoops' are about as viral as cat videos. That fits with Buzzfeed.","The most interesting comments, they don't come from people with Klout scores. They don't come from people with a history on our sites.","Superior writers, videographers and other content makers want to work with their own kind and for their own kind.","Web media needs to move to TV metaphor - with full-screen imagery and other content interrupted with full-screen ads.","Relentless and cynical traffic-trawling is bad for the soul.","We believe that the best Web content optimization strategy is something as old as journalism itself: the shocking truth and the authentic opinion.","It's no wonder that new ventures such as The Daily look first to Gawker Media when staffing up. We should not wait for a poaching expedition to pay someone what they deserve. I apologize if that has been the case and will do better in 2012.","Three-quarters of our sites - Kotaku, Gawker, Jezebel, Deadspin, Gizmodo, Lifehacker - are led by editors who built their careers within Gawker Media. That's the career path.","Critics say Internet advertising suffers from limitless inventory, which depresses prices. These exclusive front-page sponsorships are not limitless. If HBO doesn't move quickly enough, Showtime can buy out Gawker and Jezebel for the key fall TV season. On any individual day, there isn't room for both of them; and that's healthy.","Apple makes beautiful products. I own a Mac Pro, a Mac Book, a Mac Mini, an iPad, an iPhone, pretty much the entire collection.","It irritates me that everybody concentrates on Gawker, because it's just one of 15 sites and it doesn't even get the most traffic. It's a significant site, but it's not what we are.","As a print journalist, if you hear a rumour you try to stand it up and if you can't, the story dies. With a blog you can throw the rumour out there and ask for help. You can say: 'We don't know if this is true or not.'","Personally, as a print journalist, I always found the most interesting stories to be the ones hacks talked about in the bar after work.","I want to institutionalise and automate chequebook journalism.","While I love the medium, I've always been skeptical about the value of blogs as businesses.","That's always been my test for what makes a story: is this something journalists would gossip with each other about?"],"Nick Earls":["You can have your own language. You can have your own dialect; you can have your own way of saying things, but if you don't actually understand the way the language fits together, it's chaos.","I think one of the things the writers' festival does that is very good is that it brings writers from around the world and around the country and locally and puts them all in the one spot together, and that's what a lot of the world's great writers' festivals do.","I got into writing because books and stories were always a big part of my life. I loved listening to them and then reading them, and I loved making them up.","When I was about eight, I realised the person whose name was on the book got money for it, and it seemed almost too good to be true that you could get paid for making things up.","I wrote my first novel-length story when I was 14 but had no idea what to do with it. Brisbane was a long way from the publishing industry then. Nowhere's a long way from the publishing industry now.","Being a parent means my time use has to be a bit more focused, but it also gives me a new non-writing dimension to my life, which is a healthy thing. I can't wander along for weeks with an idea drifting through my head - I have someone who will drag me back into life, and that's a good thing.","When I create a character, particularly my central character, I want someone who is interesting and feels real and who might have quite a few virtues but is unlikely to be perfect, who hasn't necessarily made all the right choices.","E-books present the greatest opportunity readers have ever had to find each other. It's a chance for stories written for paper to find new life and a chance for new stories to appear, freed from the constraints of paper publishing.","I'm happy to work until I'm 70 if I'm able to. Actually, I'm happy to keep writing as long as people keep buying my books.","I want to grow up to be Tom Keneally or David Malouf: still in the game, relevant, putting out quality work, and paying tax aged 78 and 80.","I grew up in a family full of strong women. A great aunt on my mother's side had been a matron on a hospital ship in World War II, and one on my father's side had served in the Women's Royal Naval Service.","My maternal grandmother was the longest-lived of my grandparents. She migrated to Australia in her 80s and lived into her 90s. It was great that she got to be part of my adult life.","One of the most interesting female characters I've written about was Meg Riddoch, the lead character in 'The Thompson Gunner'.","Having to think so much about fictitious relationships that work or don't work, and with each relationship between characters managing to do one or other of those in its own peculiar way, I spend a lot of time thinking about relationships, real and imagined.","I like to jot down ideas on the back of envelopes and to recognise the potential value in small things. I also like the freedom to think without feeling compelled to write too early. Stories are often better if we can hold back and get to know the characters and the sounds of language."],"Nick Faldo":["When it blows here, even the seagulls walk.","He hits it long. His shoulders are impressively quick through the ball. That's where he's getting his power from. He's young and has great elasticity.","We were happily married for eight months. Unfortunately, we were married for four and a half years.","I would like to thank the press from the heart of my bottom.","I never mixed with golfers when I was playing, mainly because I didn't want to talk golf all night.","My time with my family is a priority."],"Nick Ferguson":["Like most athletes, I like to go home and relax. I try not to bring the game home with me. I might play some video games that are, let's just say, for mature audiences only. And I might get some flak for this, but I like to watch 'Seinfeld.' Sometimes, laughter is the best medicine.","As a kid, there are some things you looked forward to. You looked forward to Charlie Brown during Halloween and you looked forward to Monday Night Football.","I expected to get drafted. I knew that I wouldn't get drafted on that first day due to the fact that not a lot of people had the opportunity to see me play much.","It's always great when a defense is able to create turnovers and score. That's something we missed last year. We'd get some turnovers, but we never scored points.","The career isn't guaranteed for as long as you might want to play.","My dad was a longshoreman in the Port of Miami. Tough job. I worked down there in the summer once. One day. Never again. My dad was a no-nonsense guy. As a kid, I hated his rules, but as a man, I understand what he was teaching. He taught me you have to work hard for everything you get.","When I was in high school, my mom hated football. But then, the more I played, the more it grew on her. This game has done a lot for my family - not just from a financial standpoint, but it also helped bring my family together.","I remember bumming rides across town to Georgia Tech, trying to get myself registered, trying to apply for financial aid, trying to get their coaches to watch my film.","My mom didn't let me play tackle until I was in high school. She didn't want me to get hurt.","We played a lot of sandlot ball, so we were used to tackling each other, or falling on the concrete, things of that nature. And nine times out of 10, our flag games turned into tackle anyway. So when I got to high school, tackle football was kind of natural."],"Nick Flynn":["On a good day I write, all day.","I became an electrician after high school. But I always had this thing in me to write. But it was always a little shameful. To say you were a poet was saying you were kind of crazy, and I carried that around for a long time. I still kind of carry that. And I think it might be true, actually.","I can weep pretty easily. I can get tears in my eyes from a beautiful work of art.","That Dick Cheney is pro-torture surprises no one; he freely admits it.","That soldiers do terrible things during wartime should not surprise us.","Everything we do, I'd imagine, influences everything we will do.","You come to realize people are not simple.","Certain stories we carry with us, events in our life, they define who we are. It's not a matter of getting over anything; we have to make the best of it.","When I was a child, writing was the worst possible choice of a career in my family.","My father had always identified himself as a writer to my mother when they met. When they met, he was writing this great novel, there was no doubt about it. Part of why she left him was this delusion of greatness and identifying it very directly with being an artist.","If you're going to write about someone's life, you don't just use them for wallpaper. You have to honor and respect that life.","In life you get one take, and it's perfect. It's strange, afterwards you might think I shouldn't have reacted that way, but that's the way you reacted. That's your take; that's all you get.","I'm not sure why working at a homeless shelter made sense to me, except that I needed to immerse myself in some sort of larger real-life situation to get me out of the cage of my mind, in some ways.","I had to steel myself against this psychic devastation - to see your father on the street. It's hard enough to pick up somebody you don't know from the streets, and then to actually have other people pick your father up - it was psychically devastating.","When I was a child, writing was the worst possible choice of a career in my family. My father had always identified himself as a writer to my mother when they met. When they met, he was writing this great novel, there was no doubt about it.","The attention one gets from being a poet isn't great.","It takes an entire book to tell you what it was like. To see Robert De Niro play your father - it's not a simple answer. To see Julianne Moore play your mother. To see Paul Dano play you - that's an even more inscrutable question... he's amazing, he's totally amazing, but I can't really say if he's a good me or not.","In life you get one take, and it's perfect.","Here's a secret: Everyone, if they live long enough, will lose their way at some point. You will lose your way; you will wake up one morning and find yourself lost. This is a hard, simple truth.","The first book I could call mine, my first book, was a picture book, 'The Magic Monkey' - it was adapted from an old Chinese legend by a thirteen-year-old prodigy named Plato Chan with the help of his sister.","The only strategy I know of is to write every day, which I don't always do, because sometimes I just can't, for various reasons that seem out of my control.","I get inspired by my friends, and if a friend is a writer, that is even deeper.","For years before I became a father, I would try to spend as much time as I could with my friends who were parents and their kids. And I was really impressed. They all sort of managed to do it, and do it gracefully.","That's the thing about a book: You're in the public life for a little bit, and then you sort of go away for a little while - several years, in my case - and then you come out again, hopefully.","There's this sort of male energy that we have that can seem very destructive. But it doesn't have to be. It actually can be a very positive force.","I'd always imagined that one day I would be a father, but mostly it was off my radar. I admired friends who had somehow figured out how to cross that threshold.","Change is one of the only constants in Buddhism; as meditation became the way I breathed in the days, this became apparent.","For the first few months, I was a comically inept parent. The first night home from the hospital, I held her bare body against my bare chest until a friend who was a doctor came by and asked what I was doing, and told me to put some clothes on that baby.","What I do is write, and I try to write as closely as I can into what I call 'the mystery.'","To be honest, in my five years as an electrician, I never got the license.","Our job as writers, as far as I can tell, is to attempt to express what seems inexpressible.","I believe poetry has very little to do with memory."],"Nick Fradiani":["There will never be another 'American Idol,' which produced so many credible superstars over the years. It was a phenomenon in pop culture. It changed music.","American Idols that come off the show and don't have a hit song - that makes it tough. If you come off the show and the song isn't big, and it takes a couple months to get your single out there - that time could be damaging.","The one thing I'm really the most confident in as an artist is my songwriting ability and ear for pop music. I'm really excited to show that off. It was a side that I wasn't able to show on 'American Idol.'","I've been grinding at music for over a decade now. Since I was 18, I decided that this is what I wanted to do. It's not an easy thing. When you start getting 25, 26, people are like, 'Oh you're a musician huh? That's what you're gonna do? When are you going to get a real job?' I never gave up.","I've been a legitimate fan of Keith Urban's for a long time and have been to a bunch of his concerts.","I can sing, but I never considered myself a powerhouse vocalist but more of a rock-pop singer.","I have my master's degree in secondary education. I actually interned at a high school and student-taught at a high school for a year."],"Nick Frost":["I always think I could play a fantastic psychopath. I'd like to play a psycho. With a heart, you know. A caring lunatic.","If you think about America, it is about getting your backpack on and heading out.","I find acting tough, but sitting around chatting - that's easy.","I was an amazing bartender and a great waiter. I think, in a way, that was my acting school.","I like to think I'm some savage realist.","I'm comedy's forgotten nearly man.","I think some people see me as being some kind of lovable, bumbling buffoon, and I'm actually quite mouthy and sharp, and that doesn't compute.","I like to go home early, that's my thing. My idea of a pub crawl lasts from midday until 5 P.M., then I can go home, play with my kid, have tea and go to bed.","I'd be happy doing anything on a film set.","My wife's brother has a little house on a small island in the Baltic Sea, and we go there at Christmas. The 30-minute crossing from the mainland to this island is the most terrifying cruise you'll ever take. They give you a barf bag when you walk on board.","I wanted to write rather than do anything else. But 'cause I left school at 15, I didn't know what a noun was, still don't.","It's nice to have someone write a couture character for you.","I fall in love with every film while I'm doing it. I fall in love with the directors, I fall in love with the process. I don't think I could do it otherwise.","People presume just because you're a bigger bloke that you wouldn't be physically fit or up for the fight, but that couldn't be further from the truth.","The fight scenes in 'The World's End' have a certain balletic quality to them.","A lot of people who do drama say comedy is the hardest thing, but, not wanting to sound like a bighead, comedy is easy for me, as I've always been fairly funny.","I love working. I feel guilty about doing nothing; I get bored.","Someone once pulled me aside and said it was all right to succeed, and I realised that I knew what failure felt like, but I didn't know what success felt like. I've carried that with me ever since.","Even though I didn't write 'Shaun Of The Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz,' I never felt left out of the creative process.","I am a geek in terms of, I love 'Close Encounters' and I love 'Star Wars,' but other things... 'Doctor Who,' I don't really care about at all, I couldn't give a fig about it.","I don't describe myself as a sociable person now. I can be quite... you know... grumpy? Is that a word? I guess I can be a bit grumpy.","I would be happy living on a massive ranch in Montana and not seeing anyone except my friends and family.","There's a difference between watching a film and watching a bit of cinema and enjoying a film as a piece of cinema.","I would agree 'Paul' is a sci-fi genre movie. And a road movie.","People say, 'Oh, you're famous now, so you must go to L.A.' - I don't live in L.A. now - but it's like, why wouldn't you? The weather is amazing, the film industry's there, it's a great quality of life.","One of my biggest disappointments is watching the trailer for the second 'Lord of the Rings' film and having Gandalf in it. Why? You know, he died in the first one, why give it away in the trailer just to try and sell a thousand more seats? It's daft.","I'd like to play the voice of the Iron in the Monopoly movie.","I'm not going to say I'm not a fan, but I'm a fan of house music, essentially, and kind of indie, and I was always into the kind of sub-pop Seattle Mud Honey and Pearl Jam kind of sound. But my kind of big love was house music ever since I was 15/16, going to raves when I was 15 or 16 years old and not going to school, like a naughty boy.","People are not going to like everything.","I love Twitter; I'm on Twitter quite a lot.","The zeitgeist is ever-changing. If you try second guess what people want, you'll miss it.","I'm usually up at 6 A.M., even on the weekend.","My formative years were all about 'Star Wars' - the first three, not the last crap, obviously. I understood 'Star Trek' but it was too caricatured for me.","I volunteered on a farming community in Israel for two years when I was a teenager. One of the jobs involved clearing out a massive warehouse full of chickens ready for the abattoir. The smell of 40,000 chickens in 45C is awful.","As a kid, I wasn't listening to The Who; I was listening to Frankie Knuckles.","In the early 2000s, I was introduced to the noble art of kickboxing, it thrilled me, and I loved it. I loved the honour and the discipline, and I also loved the punching.","Football and me have never got on. My instinct and love for the harder end of contact had always meant I was perhaps a little too heavy-handed for football. Somehow it left me feeling unfulfilled.","I'm not good at meeting people, and I'm not good at small talk."],"Nick Goepper":["I think the Winter Olympics are definitely on a smaller scale than the summer games, but with the inclusion of cool new sports like slope style skiing and snowboarding, it is going to breathe new life into them and attract a whole new crowd.","If you want something bad enough, and you're having enough fun doing it, you can accomplish it. You just got to get creative and find a way.","I think I have the ability to win any contest I enter. As long as I stay healthy and keep having fun with my skiing, there's no regressing.","The craziest thing is walking down the streets of New York and people recognizing me and asking for my photo. It has been pretty wild. I am used to getting spotted in ski towns, but I never thought it would happen in a place like this.","Skiing not only for yourself and your family, but for your country, was surreal. The amount of support I got from back home in Indiana was insane.","The skiing center of the world is southeastern Indiana, where I like to call home. It looks like the Alps there; it's crazy.","I skied on Astroturf and PVC pipe on the slope in my backyard.","Most places in the Midwest, you ski on piles of trash, like retired landfills.","Contrary to popular belief, there are actually quite a few guys in the action sports community that have faith and are Christians.","The inclusion of slope style in the Olympics is cool. I think it's going to be a total breath of fresh air. The Olympics needs us more than we need it.","I like to think that faith has been a part of my life since I was a lot younger. It's definitely a part of my athletic career. I always wear a cross on my goggles during contests when I'm doing something gnarly. It's a reminder that I've got someone else helping me out.","I'm pretty well-rounded. I can do most of my tricks left and right, in both directions. I try to be smooth and confident. But it's still developing. I'm still trying to find my own personal touch in the way I ski.","I had just got back from skiing, and I was just hanging out, browsing the Internet, and I found some article that was a press release that said slope style was gonna be included in the Olympics. And the first thing I did was call up my coach Mike Hanley, and we were ecstatic.","I haven't done any major filming with a major production company yet, but I've definitely done a lot of filming with a lot of professionals, filmers, and film little edits and put them up online. But I would definitely say that slope style skiers are entertainers as much as they are athletes."],"Nick Hanauer":["The person earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 isn't going out to eat at restaurants. They're not taking piano lessons. They're not going to the gym or the yoga studio. They're not sending mom flowers on Mother's day. What good is this person in the economy? If you raise it to $15 an hour, they're doing all of those things.","Prosperity in human society is misunderstood. The difference between a rich and poor society is the number of problems that society solves for its citizens. That means technological innovation is the source of all prosperity, but with every tech innovation, you also get disruption - ultimately, social and civic disruption.","I have a 15-year-old boy, and we are about to give him car keys, which seems like an act of insanity when you know what you know about 15-year-old boy behavior. But in 2018, we'll have self-driving cars, and it will be so much better. My son may be the last generation of kids who learns to drive.","I'm not the smartest guy you've ever met, or the hardest-working. I was a mediocre student. I'm not technical at all - I can't write a word of code. What sets me apart, I think, is a tolerance for risk and an intuition about what will happen in the future. Seeing where things are headed is the essence of entrepreneurship.","Most people believe, mistakenly, that wealth in a human society has something to do with money, but that's not true. Money is simply a medium of exchange. Prosperity in a human society is the accumulation of solutions to human problems that we create for ourselves.","The most insidious thing about trickle-down economics is not the claim that if the rich get richer, everyone is better off. It is the claim made by those who oppose any increase in the minimum wage that if the poor get richer, that will be bad for the economy. This is nonsense.","When you have a tax system in which most of the exemptions and the lowest rates benefit the richest, all in the name of job creation, all that happens is that the rich get richer.","Tech innovation is something societies have to pursue as vigorously as they can. We have to innovate civically and socially at the same rate; otherwise, you create unfortunate disruptions, and that's where you have people opposing technological innovations.","A thriving middle class is the source of growth in a technological, capitalist economy. Investing in the middle class is the most pro-business thing you can do.","The theory that if wages go up, employment goes down isn't a physical law like F=MA. It's a moral law, like 'Bedtime is 9:00 P.M.'","You show me a highly unequal society, and I will show you a police state. Or an uprising. There are no counterexamples. None. It's not if, it's when.","People want to think of economics as a natural science, like physics, with the comforting reliability of simple-to-understand theories like F=MA. Unfortunately, it isn't. Economics is a social science, and the so-called theories are really social and moral constructs.","The most powerful forces in economics are not numbers or facts. They are prejudices and preferences. No amount of evidence will ever change the degree to which many of the rich and powerful prefer themselves to be richer and more powerful and others poorer and weaker.","We became enthralled with the view that wealth trickled down from the top and that if you poured money into rich people, sort of like an ingredient, prosperity and jobs would squirt out of them like donuts. And if you understand economies in the 19th-century way, that view is plausible, and I think a lot of people accepted it.","If low taxes were the way that people like me created wealth, then we'd be starting our companies in the Congo or Somalia or Afghanistan, but we're not. We come to places where there are lots and lots of customers.","Economics is mostly how humans rationalize who gets what and why. It's how we instantiate our preferences about status, privileges, and power.","During Seattle's successful campaign for a $15 an hour minimum wage, our opponents would sometimes roll their eyes and snort, 'If $15 is so good, why not $50?' It was a straw man argument: Nobody was proposing a $50 minimum wage; it would have been too high, and we said so.","Amazon didn't create any jobs. Amazon probably destroyed a million jobs in our economy.","The truth is that all civic and social change is friction. Politics is friction. The only way you can bend the arc of history is to create that kind of friction, which is something that makes most people incredibly uncomfortable but which, for whatever reason, because of my upbringing or because of my genetics, is something that doesn't bug me.","Like most plutocrats, I, too, am a proud and unapologetic capitalist. I have founded, cofounded or funded over 30 companies across a range of industries. I was the first non-family investor in Amazon.com. I cofounded a company called aQuantive that we sold to Microsoft for 6.4 billion dollars. My friends and I, we own a bank.","We plutocrats need to get this trickle-down economics thing behind us: this idea that the better we do, the better everyone else will do. It's not true. How could it be? I earn 1,000 times the median wage, but I do not buy 1,000 times as much stuff, do I?","No matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get, we can never drive a great national economy. Only a thriving middle class can do that.","Middle-out economics rejects the old misconception that an economy is a perfectly efficient, mechanistic system and embraces the much more accurate idea of an economy as a complex ecosystem made up of real people who are dependent on one another.","The middle class creates us rich people, not the other way around.","There is no earthly reason why Walmart and McDonald's and Walgreens and these other giant, profitable institutions should have one worker in need of public assistance. It's ridiculous.","I think the idea that giant profitable corporations should pay their workers enough so that they don't need food stamps - since when is that left-wing? How did that become 'leftie?' That doesn't seem leftie to me. That seems common sense.","We rich people have been falsely persuaded by our schooling and the affirmation of society, and have convinced ourselves, that we are the main job creators. It's simply not true.","Prosperity isn't something that squirts out of rich people.","I come from generations of progressive, atheist Jews.","I'm not the world's best philosopher. But I am one of the world's best strategists. I will put my strategic abilities against anybody on Earth.","I have absolutely no rituals or routines other than I work obsessively and think constantly about my work, to the dismay and discomfort of everyone I employ. And my family.","One of the things that I think makes me successful is the way in which I collaborate with others. In my opinion, nothing great is ever the product of one mind. It's always a consequence of some sort of self-critical collaboration.","A lot of people think that persuasion is all about values and aligning values. I largely disagree. I think persuasion generally, and political persuasion more particularly, has much more to do with explaining in new ways and connecting dots in new ways than just invoking emotions and values.","I have, oddly, two ski houses - trying to sell one.","Greed is a sin because humans are social creatures. And they simply cannot survive without the opposite of greed, which is cooperation.","I think the people who end up being extraordinarily successful - it's been my observation - tend to care enormously about status, particularly business people, right? Because the only point of money, you know, the only reason to have a 300-foot-long boat is because they're bigger than 200-foot-long boats.","Government does create prosperity and growth by creating the conditions that allow both entrepreneurs and their customers to thrive; balancing the power of capitalists like me and workers isn't bad for capitalism - it's essential to it.","You see, we capitalists will never actually ask you to work overtime. I don't even track your hours. I just make it clear that I trust you to get your job done in the time allotted. And then I hand you twice as much work as you can reasonably do in a 40-hour week.","The higher the unemployment rate, the more leverage I have to 'encourage' you to 'do what it takes' to keep your job. And so you work even more hours, pushing unemployment up and wages down. And that, my friends, is one of the little tricks that keeps you poor and me rich.","Rising inequality is toxic to growth. High levels of inequality exclude people - both as innovators and customers - diminishing both innovation and demand.","In software, it's easy to understand what people want, and it's hard to build. Internet stuff is super easy to build, but it's hard to know what people want.","The thing about us businesspeople is that we love our customers rich and our employees poor.","All human endeavor, all human civilization, is the act of solving collective action problems. Should we put out our own fires, or should we have a fire department? Should we build roads, or should we hack our way through the woods from one factory to another?","Diversity is America's most valuable resource. It is what makes us the most innovative nation on Earth.","In a sufficiently prosperous society where people specialize sufficiently, and where enough of the crappy work is done by machines, all work becomes art.","The only really expensive thing in our family budget, frankly, is private air travel.","I make an eight-figure income annually.","Business people do two things with their time fundamentally. The first is that they try to create sales, right? Revenue, key to business. But the other thing they devote their time to equally is cost containment. That is to say, how to not create jobs. Because the fewer jobs you can create for the revenue you create, the more profit you make.","If Jeff Bezos and I had started Amazon.com in a poverty-stricken corner of Africa, there would have been no job creation because there would be no people to buy the stuff from Amazon.com. The difference here is the American middle class, which is by every measure the most extraordinary economic achievement in the history of the world.","Once America's CEOs get back to the business of growing their companies rather than growing their share prices, shareholder value will take care of itself, and all Americans will share in the higher wages and other benefits of a renewed era of economic growth.","It is true that rich people can spend more money than middle class people, but there's this upper limit on what we can spend. I drive a very nice car, but it's only one car. I don't own a thousand, even though I earn a thousand times the median wage. I have a few jackets, not a few thousand.","The thing about a real economy is that it actually is like the game of Monopoly in the sense that when one person has all the money, the game is over. And in a game of Monopoly, of course, that's quite charming, but in a real economy, it's much more problematic.","The thing I've learned most about poverty is how expensive it is to be poor. It's super easy to pay rent every month if you earn enough to pay rent and have a decent job. It's super hard to pay rent if you need a coupon from the state and then need to go find an apartment that will accept that coupon and only that coupon."],"Nick Harkaway":["Yes, you are under surveillance. Yes, it is odious. Yes, it should bother you. And yes, it's hard to know how to avoid it.","The First World War was a horror of gas, industrialised slaughter, fear, and appalling human suffering.","Peace is not a state - it is a choice, and you have to remake it every day. It's possible to get a sort of stability, a habit of peace, but it's like an egg balanced, spinning, on its point: lose your momentum, and your equilibrium is gone, too.","Names aren't just coathooks, they're coats. They're the first thing anyone knows about you.","We need to differentiate between commercial piracy - where criminal organisations produce illicit DVDs on a huge scale - and domestic, unauthorised filesharing, which may or may not be detrimental to overall sales.","My scientific qualifications are relatively scant. I like science. I try really hard to educate myself about it, but in the end, if something has to go 'boom,' and it would probably only go 'fwoosh,' I am relatively unconcerned about that, which is a sin, but not, I think, a grave one.","As I work, I see my writing - each scene, each chapter, each section, each book - in three-act structures and classic myths, and I analyze them through the handy filter of the detective story.","The end doesn't justify anything, because all we ever live with is the means.","I don't do a lot of research, exactly, but I'm constantly wandering through the world finding things incredible and remembering them.","There is not now, nor I suspect will there ever be, a le Carre novel with ninjas in it. Most serious novelists are wary of including ninjas in their writing. That's a shame, because many much-admired works of modern fiction could benefit from a few.","My reading of history is that we continually inherit trouble.","Executive power in any nation arguably has more in common with executive power in another country than with the citizens it should serve.","I'm an irredeemable urbanite. I can't imagine living more than a five-minute walk from my fellow human beings. Other people are vital to my peace of mind.","In abandoning the understanding that things - services, goods, wars, and houses - have costs, we risk becoming infantilised, incapable of making decisions about government or finance, and perhaps above all about the environment, the wellbeing of the planet upon which we depend and which our children will inherit from us.","We lose stories every day because they drift out of use and into the vast limbo of in-copyright, out-of-print books whose ownership is unclear.","We are bodies which think, and we're at home with steampunk because it is an ethos of design and creativity which acknowledges the humanly physical: that which we can understand with our fingers.","Steampunk appeals to the idea of uniqueness, to the one-off item, while every mainstream consumer technology of recent years is about putting human beings into ever more granular, packageable and mass-produced identities so that they can be sold or sold to, perfectly mapped and understood.","Knowledge is not just power - it is control.","If you ask who I aspire to, well, if a single line of mine was as funny as P. G. Wodehouse can be, that would be great.","I wanted a pseudonym partly because I'm quite shy and private. I know that sounds ludicrous, but if I should be lucky enough to make a hit, I wanted to be able to shrug off the mantel of Nick Harkaway when I got home.","I read my father's books growing up. I thought then and I still think now that his writing is wonderful. It delights and infuriates me in equal measure that he's still that good.","The great thing is to have been surrounded by stories all my life.","I'm a novelist: I spend a great part of my day pretending to myself that I'm in a different world, being a different person, faced with decisions I pretend I haven't created.","I do public appearances. I'm bluff, hearty, goofy. I wear loud clothes, and I read the funny bits. I occasionally get taken to task for one thing or another, and I acknowledge my fault, my flaw, my failure, and I move on.","Prize lists are out, and you're not on them? Nature of the world - means nothing. Prizes are a lottery.","I never engage negatively with reviewers. If someone says something that enrages me, I do what I do on stage. I make a joke about myself and move on. Sometimes people say things that are manifestly wrong or even apparently malicious. That's fine, too. It's a response.","I know that when I talk to my parents and my friends, there's a strong feeling of the world out of control and damaged.","I am the world's most appalling martial artist. I am so bad. I've studied jujitsu, kickboxing, t'ai chi. Once, I was sparring with someone, made a mistake, and managed to knock them down. I was so shocked that I dropped to my knees to see if they were all right, and then they knocked me out cold. From the floor.","I think lots of boys sat down with 'The Three Musketeers' and felt it was a really long book, but then discovered that it's a really gripping swashbuckling story.","There's a saying in the movie industry that if your movie is about what you actually think it's about, you're in big trouble. I think it's the same with books.","My dad and I compete on the pool table; that's the most important competition of our lives. The fact that I'm writing and it works for me is one of the great joys for him. We talk about writing, and it's great.","I grew up on the Roger Moore and Sean Connery Bond movies, so the DNA of my spies is extremely ridiculous and goofy.","After university, I went into film. I started out making tea, managed a brief stint as an assistant director, then found myself writing a screenplay. In the end, I wrote quite a few - but by January 2006, I wanted out.","Suddenly, the idea of writing a book was like coming home. I didn't tell anyone except my wife, Clare. I just began.","I'm not shy, exactly, but I am private. I don't like to talk about myself. I had to learn - I was interviewed for print, radio and even TV.","I'm fascinated by human agency - by the process of decision, both in the individual and the mass.","I studied revolutions at university, and I think each revolution must begin with a moment of 'no.' If enough people have that moment at the same time, it becomes a movement.","I am an avid reader of comics, though I came to them late.","'Gone-Away World' was a shotgun blast, an explosion out of the box I'd put myself into writing film scripts. 'Tigerman' is shorter, tighter, more crafted.","My wife runs the charity Reprieve, and so rendition, droning, and capital punishment are very much the topics of our dinner table because of that.","I think the reason I wrote screenplays for nearly a decade was because it was my territory. I could stake that out.","In the aftermath of September 11, you can't - as Tony Blair was so fond of suggesting - draw a line under historical events. They don't go away. They come back.","Booksellers are tied to publishing - they need conventional publishing models to continue - but for those companies, that's not the case. Amazon is an infrastructure company; Apple sells hardware; Google is really an advertising company. You can't afford as a publisher to have those companies control your route to market.","An important part of the Internet is that it provides a space for people whose identities are socially unacceptable. If it enables someone who feels minoritised to be who they want to be, it's actually worth having other people be offensive. I'd much rather have both than have neither.","The mainstream of literary culture in the U.K. is very averse to writing about technology.","In a novel, even if you put a country in the wrong hemisphere, which I've done, I can always claim it was part of the additional weirdness of the story.","I wrote the first draft of 'Tigerman' while my wife was pregnant - needless to say, I was relaxed and casual about her well-being during this tender time - and the novel clearly has its center in that panicked parental desperation that accompanies a first child and in the admittedly comedic extremes to which it drives us.","I'm not an absolutist about free speech. Intellectually, I believe that most of the time it's better to let things get said, argue them, and put lies and stupidities to rest. Practically, I know that newspapers rarely issue corrections with the same prominence they give to denouncements - and Twitter, by its nature, never does.","The idea that the law should punish what is rude; that government should protect our tender sensibilities from those who would - quite often with shallow motivations but sometimes with deeper and more serious complaints - challenge our national certainties and rituals, should alarm and anger us.","With true free speech has to come an understanding of when and when not to use it. But you can't legislate that. It must be voluntary - especially in a world where a whisper can reach a million people in an eye blink.","Margaret Thatcher inherited a country in transition. The British Empire was still a considerable entity well into the 20th century.","In the span of a human lifetime, and well within the collective memory, Britain went from a stable imperial power ruling an appreciable fraction of the Earth's surface to being a tumultuous patchwork which was at least superficially in decline.","We don't need to chase a nostalgic rendering of Britain as it never was and never can be: we need instead an understanding of who we really are and what a happy, prosperous, just nation might look like.","Cheese is good. And Britain, despite the grumblings of the French and the outrage of the Swiss, not to mention some plucky challenges from Italy, Austria, and Spain, has some of the best cheese in the world. We're world leaders in cheese.","At the heart of both democracy and capitalism is a simple assumption that, across the board, people make free and relatively rational decisions: that we are, to borrow a medical term, Gillick Competent.","I do not propose that everyone in Guantanamo or its evil twin at Bagram is innocent. I just don't believe we should incarcerate people without trial and torture them or facilitate and profit from their torture.","We simply cannot afford to allow our government to go unscrutinised, most of all in amid the bleak seeming imperatives of the 'war on terror'.","My family has something of a special relationship with confidence tricks: my grandfather was a professional swindler.","We have a curious relationship with 'funny' in the U.K. We love to laugh, but we also think that making people laugh is just a little bit second-tier, especially in a literary context.","Happiness is boundlessly weird. Other people's choices often seem to delight them, where I would run screaming.","Sir Terry Pratchett - he was knighted in 2009, and on him it looked earned rather than entitled - wrote about dragons, wizards, turtles, witches, time-travelling monks, and suitcases with legs.","I make up names for people all the time - it's part of writing. Very often, the name comes with the character, along with of a sense of who they are and what they do.","In both 'Tigerman' and my first book, 'The Gone-Away World,' there are characters who never really get names. They're too fundamentally who they are to be bound by a name, so I couldn't give them one.","Whether you're choosing for yourself or for a character - or for a child - names have baggage of their own.","Digital books are still painfully ugly and weirdly irritating to interact with. They look like copies of paper, but they can't be designed or typeset in the same way as paper, and however splendid the cover images may look on a hi-res screen, they're still images rather than physical things.","To my irritation, you still can't flick through an ebook properly; you can't riffle the pages, you can't look at more than one page at once.","Throughout the '90s and early 2000s, our financial industry and governments leaned on a snake-oil mirage of wealth creation, a bubble predicated on the obvious falsehood that things could only get better.","Amazon makes money differently from a conventional publisher. It is an infrastructure player.","E-readers are uninspired. They're slabs of plastic with fiddly controls and display a badly-formatted, typographically impoverished rendering of a paper book. That's not the electronic book I want. I want a gorgeous physical object, with paper pages, that can transform into any story I choose, perfectly presented on the page.","Digitisation was supposed to lead to a great democratisation of access to creative work.","Amazon is a corporation, not a philanthropic trust dedicated to the production of works of art and literature.","Google's library plan was staggering and exciting - it wasn't the idea I objected to, but the method.","The market, as we're all painfully aware in the aftermath of the banking crisis, can be an idiot. It has no perception of right or wrong, or even sensible or insane. It sees profit.","I'm usually reading too many books - in fact, I'm usually reading enough books that if the stack fell on me, I'd be injured.","I work in our living room, a strange room in a strange, topsy-turvy house. I work underneath this enormous bookshelf.","When the time comes to work, I work.","I used desperately to want to be a brooding hero from literature, but I'm optimistic, healthy and fair-haired.","My books are written from the heart, to entertain: they're books I would like to read. Because of that, when I meet people who like them, we have so much to talk about!","In ancient Greece, Socrates reportedly didn't fancy a literate society. He felt that people would lose the capacity to think for themselves, simply adopting the perspective of a handy written opinion, and that they would cease to remember what could be written down.","In a social context, digital technology introduces you to neighbours of the mind - people who are separated by distance, but close to you in thought and interest.","It's true that interacting through text means no eyelines, no facial expressions, no tone of voice. That can be an advantage, helping us to consider content rather than eloquence, import rather than source.","The Internet has the capacity to extend to us genuine choice, and that is not without risk. Real power does entail real responsibility.","An enormous amount of a writer's life is performance. I find myself wondering, at the moment, whether I do too much of it.","I'm caught somewhere between introversion and extroversion. Performance is natural to me, joyful, but it is also exhausting. I can feed on it, but the expense is high, too, like being a carnivore: I have to chase down my meals.","Victorian theorists competed to identify how many biologically differentiated races lived on Earth and proposed inherent characteristics for them, formulated explanations for these presumed variations in humanity.","The reason steampunk attracts people is that it is premised on a technology which is visible and pleasing to the naked eye, and whose moving parts are comprehensible on a human scale.","I'm a white, middle-aged, married, middle-class male with kids. I couldn't be disenfranchised if I tried.","Revolutions come in two stages: the bit where everything gets smashed and the bit where you have to build it again. The first is great fun; the second is so very hard.","Professional politicians will say anything, and they're always careful to leave themselves room to turn around and do the other.","I want a politics that doesn't need to pretend to be holy or perfect or infallible. I want a politics that gets on with it.","A lot of author events are basically hour-long classes in entropy perched on bad seating under bright, hard lights, with - if you're lucky - bad Chardonnay and cheese on a stick waiting for you at the end of the ride.","Performance is hard. I know this. I really enjoy it, but I have bombed, I have fluffed, and I have said the wrong thing.","'Tigerman' was born in the front seat of a Hilux SUV on the road north out of Chiang Mai.","All my characters are me, in one way or another.","Being a parent is weird. It changes people in subtle and unsubtle ways. In my case, it awoke a kind of manic sentinel in my brain. Anything in the house that might be a threat to the kids or to my wife gets terminated - food, sharp edges, poor wiring.","The notion of our leaders as patrician ascetics of unassailable virtue is risible.","We tend to assume that data is either private or public, either owned by one person or shared by many. In fact there's more to it than that, above and beyond the upsetting reality that private data is now anything but."],"Nick Hornby":["I wasted the 1980s. I wasted every minute at Cambridge talking to people who knew more about music than I did.","I have boys, and boys are particularly resistant to reading books. I had some success recently with Sherman Alexie's great young adult novel 'The Absolutely True Diary Of A Part-Time Indian.' I told my son it was highly inappropriate for him and one of the most banned books in America. That got his attention, and he raced through it.","I think quite a misguided literary culture has grown up in the 20th century that says a book has to have a seriousness of purpose and a seriousness of language.","I think that every book that's in a bookstore should entertain in some way.","Youth is a quality not unlike health: it's found in greater abundance among the young, but we all need access to it.","The Oscars are like a political campaign. You have to have the right candidates, and the people in Hollywood know what they are.","The natural state of the football fan is bitter disappointment, no matter what the score.","It takes big business a couple of decades to work out how best to exploit a cultural form; once that has happened, 'that high-low fork in the road' is unavoidable, and the middle way begins to look impossibly daunting.","I'm quite gloomy. I just am one of those people, vaguely lugubrious.","People love Jane Austen, even though those books are absurd to us, because we like the clarity of it: we can see very clearly what Elizabeth Bennett has to overcome, what she has to deal with.","When you see the poet laureate saying that every child should have read 'Ulysses' and that you're just giving up on children if you think it's elitist - does that include children with special needs or whose first language isn't English?","When someone says they've read your book 15 times, you think, 'Well, you should read something else.'","One of the depressing things one realizes as one gets older is how much of one's tastes and attitudes are simply products of economic circumstance at the time.","If it's not gripping you, you are reading the wrong book.","I kind of stumbled on the material for 'An Education' and thought it would make a good movie, and one of the things that came out of that, for me, was that I learned that if you write a big part for a girl or a young woman, you get the opportunity to work with the best talent in the world.","Screenwriting is about condensing.","We need a romantic illusion to embark on relationships in the first place. After that, they survive or fail for other, more practical reasons.","There's music every day. I don't think I could write without it. Not that I listen while I'm writing. It's more hearing a piece of music that I want to somehow convert into prose, as a creative inspiration.","At a crude estimate, I must have played 'Thunder Road' 1,500 times.","I'm really not a big rereader - I'm too aware of my own ignorance.","However varied you try to make your work, you still bump up against the end of you. You keep knocking into a wall, and the wall is your own skull. But when you adapt somebody's work, it's like a door into somewhere else. It feels like a holiday from myself.","I always thought 'Of Mice and Men' was such a perfect book because there's nothing not to understand, but it's still really clever and moving and complicated, but everybody understands the complication.","Sequels are very rarely a good idea, and in any case, the success of the book changed my relationship with the club in some ways.","I don't want my books to exclude anyone, but if they have to, then I would rather they excluded the people who feel they are too smart for them!","Everything's complicated, even those things that seem flat in their bleakness or sadness.","We can't be as good as we'd want to, so the question then becomes, how do we cope with our own badness?","Radio football is football reduced to its lowest common denominator.","Typically, booksellers like to put things into neat little categories.","I didn't really want to write about music very much in 'High Fidelity.' I wanted to write about the relationship stuff, and the music stuff is kind of a bit of fun on top and something to frame it with.","Joni Mitchell's someone who has tried to make sense of her own world, sometimes painfully, through song.","I like writing about popular culture. It helps to place people. I think you can be really, really accurate if you know enough about it, and place people precisely.","The whole purpose of books is that we read them, and if you find you can't, it might not be your inadequacy that's to blame. 'Good' books can be pretty awful sometimes.","I'm a reader for lots of reasons. On the whole, I tend to hang out with readers, and I'm scared they wouldn't want to hang out with me if I stopped.","I love the detail about the workings of the human heart and mind that only fiction can provide - film can't get in close enough.","Your failure to enjoy a highly rated novel doesn't mean you're dim - you may find that Graham Greene is more to your taste, or Stephen Hawking or Iris Murdoch or Ian Rankin. Dickens, Stephen King, whoever.","Every time we pick up a book from a sense of duty and we find that we're struggling to get through it, we reinforce the notion that reading is something we should do, but telly is something that we want to do.","If you can get every kid to have found a book that he or she loves, then you've done a great job.","Jeremy Corbyn has proved popular with young voters in part because he has promised an end to austerity.","I used to be a teacher, and I know how difficult it is to strike a balance between focused conversation and an atmosphere which prevents creativity and thought.","Lots of times when I'm offered things, I can't see how a story gets filmed. Either it's too internal or it doesn't have a strong spine.","'An Education' was a complicated piece of work because it came from a tiny essay, so it took me a while to find the story I wanted to tell and the characters I wanted to tell it about. That really only emerged after four or five drafts.","With 'Brooklyn,' I knew the story I wanted to tell, and I just had a very strong sense that if I turned the volume up a little bit, it could be something really special.","Sometimes when people are attached to a project, they need persuading to stay attached, and then, in retrospect, they're not the right person.","When you're adapting a novel, there are always scenes taken out of the book, and no matter which scenes they are, it's always someone's favorite. As a screenwriter, you realize, 'Well, it doesn't work if you include everyone's favorite scenes.'","I only want to write books and movies about women.","Why are we scared of a '50s weepie? Why are we scared of a movie that pulls you in and punches you in the stomach?","We don't feel duty-bound to get all the way through a TV program. If we're not enjoying it, we turn over. Movies, we tend to give more of the benefit of the doubt because they're only 90 minutes or two hours. But books, there is this thing of, 'It's a book. I've got to finish it.'","Once you create this thing between duty and reading, it's over. Reading's over.","The whole point of reading is that the writer is speaking to you, and if you're not listening, you're not going to have any fun reading.","If you're reading a novel that was written in 1964, you'll find out more about 1964 than if you're reading a nonfiction book written in 1964 because you're hearing how language was actually used and hearing what people's actual concerns were at the beginning of the 1960s.","I think the moment you're writing about somebody who's not exactly you, then the challenge is all equal.","My computer is littered with abandoned projects.","In a way, novel writing is such a permanently student lifestyle. When it comes to movies, and you have to go to these meetings and try and impress people and get money out of them, I feel as though I'm playacting at being somebody who's grown up.","I think it's weird when you become rich at 40.","It takes me two to three years to write a novel. A screenplay is 100 pages and takes five years.","I think firmly that art is no use to anyone unless it offers some kind of consolation or hope.","It wasn't until 1963 that you would really want to listen to any kind of English music.","When most people come in from work, 95 percent of them reach for the remote control. Then they read before they go to sleep, to get off to sleep. They do that because reading feels like a duty, and TV feels like fun.","I hated teaching Shakespeare. In order for the students to understand what was going on, you had to tell them the story of 'Macbeth' or whatever. Shakespeare is about character and language, and they didn't get any of that.","I only read the very best music books. Donald Fagan's memoir 'Eminent Hipsters' is great. Bob Dylan's memoir 'Chronicles' and Patty Smith's 'Just Kids' are both incredible.","I think, always, with a new book, I get nervous. I think mostly it is because work is really important to me, and a book doing well is important because it buys you another one. Not because of the money but if you keep doing interesting work, work that people like, they will want you to do more, and offers that are interesting come in.","I would like to have a go at TV. I think, especially when you have kids, that you spend a lot of time watching telly, and you think, 'How come I'm not doing that?'","I spent as much time watching telly and films when I was a kid as I did lying around reading books. I think it's crazy that writers are only allowed to say that certain books have influenced them.","I can't imagine writing a screenplay where I didn't feel deeply connected at some kind of visceral level to the material.","The more screenwriting you do, the more you become aware that particular scenes aren't going to end up in the movie because they're too expensive. That has perhaps changed the way I think about writing novels, actually, because now I write expensive scenes whenever I can.","I think I am naturally depressive.","Studying English was useless, completely useless. It took me years to recover from that. Every time I tried to write, it sounded like a bad university essay.","I applied for a job on 'Melody Maker' once.","I've always been able to enjoy aspects of my life.","There were authors I read as an adult who completely inspired me. But when I was a teenager, I got to hang out with Tom Stoppard for a bit. My mum was his wife's secretary. He was obviously super smart, but he was also approachable and normal. I think he was the first person I'd ever met who I'd thought, 'Oh, I see. There's a living in this.'","You can't really ask for anything more than to be working for your entire life - and to be doing something that some people respond to.","A lot of what 'Funny Girl' is about, for me, is the experience feeling very happy doing a certain thing with a certain group of people. That partly came about because of having really positive experiences writing movies.","I always naturally want to change things up if I possibly can. I never want to write a sequel to a book. I don't want to go back over things. I don't want to adapt my own books for the screen. That's something that's important to me, the keeping it fresh.","The easiest thing to write was 'Fever Pitch' because it was a memoir.","Whether I am writing about a man or woman makes no difference in terms of difficulty.","Writing is about confidence and wondering what the point of anything is.","If you're 22 and got everything you want, what are you going to write about for the rest of your life?","I think it does everybody a lot of good to have a period of no success.","I do not wish to produce prose that draws attention to itself, rather than the world it describes.","Home was extremely normal. But my dad's life was quite exotic, really. When I went away to stay with him, it was a different world. I never wanted to be in that world. I was much happier with my mates at home.","I have the same interests as women. Well, apart from football and music, obviously. I've always had as many female friends as male ones. The novels I read as a young man were all by women writers, and when I started writing, I wanted to set my books inside the home.","Men use music and football to fill up holes in their lives.","The most important thing for me is realism. I don't like writing which does somersaults on the page, and I'm no great fan of the hard work literary novel.","It's like when you get sick of your own cooking: I occasionally wish I could write something that didn't come out sounding like me. All writers must experience that.","Words don't come very easily to me. Which, given my profession, is a worrying impediment.","The best bit of novel writing is being allowed to write exactly what you want at the speed that you want, and to include as many different people and places and times as you want, working with pretty much only one person, the editor, whose job it is to get it in good shape for publication.","I think I became less literary after I sold more!","All the Oscars stuff for 'An Education' was incredibly exciting, especially because it was such an underdog project - no one would give us the money for it, and we all nearly gave up because it wasn't getting anywhere, then suddenly a breakthrough and this really lovely film, which then took on a life of its own.","Football really felt like a private thing when I was in my teens because it wasn't on television, for a start, apart from 'Match of the Day.'","If adults are not enjoying something they're doing in their leisure time, they should stop doing it.","It seems to me quite often that the journeys of young women are more moving because they are hemmed in more, and dramatically it's more interesting to think about and write about people whose lives are circumscribed in some way.","I write slowly. I can't move on until I've got a paragraph right.","I've never met anyone who is seriously bad.","I think the things that are most intimate are nameless and shapeless.","I couldn't imagine a list of 10 records that didn't contain a punk record - that didn't contain a Clash record.","I used to go and see the Clash a fair bit. I did think they were dead cool, and very handsome.","I'd say I got into Marvin Gaye properly in college.","I can't stand it when writers moan about what film-makers might do or have done to their books. There's a very simple answer: don't take the money.","I miss independent record stores very much.","The writing in those HBO dramas, like 'The Wire,' is as good as anything I've seen.","It's a great relief that you're not as bad a parent as you thought you were.","The Internet's changed everything. There are no record stores to hang out in anymore.","My relationships are fairly stable.","With movies, it always feels like such a long shot getting it made.","I can remember my father gave me a huge history of football for my 12th birthday - I used to read that a lot. I can remember thinking it was cool that something I was interested in even had a history. Most things I loved didn't.","Dylan's 'Chronicles' is easily the best rock n' roll memoir ever written, as far as I'm concerned. There aren't many stories in there, but if you want to know where an artist came from and why he thinks the way he does, then that's the one."],"Nick Johnson":["The further you get into technology, the further you go into gaming. That's the general rule.","A lot of the things that until now seemed unthinkable are starting to be thinkable.","I was happy that I was drafted, and then it was the Yankees and that just made it even better.","You look at all the great players that they've had and the potential of playing in Yankee Stadium.","I just wanted to go play in the big leagues. But possibly playing for the Yankees is very special.","I just try to get on anyway that I can, hit, hit-by-pitch, walk, home runs, anything.","When you get on base, holes open up and things happen and you're able to find a way to score runs.","I think maybe L.A. or San Francisco could be rushed, but Sacramento is just laid back!","You play to win, to get that World Series ring, All-Star games and whatever comes with it.","I'll get mine in a few years, when I get up there and when the time comes.","The concept of industry domination of regulatory agencies was well known and documented in the literature by the 1960s.","I don't plan on going back to legal work. I wanted an international career, and finance seemed to be where some interesting career opportunities were.","I had a great time with baseball growing up. I was lucky to grow up with it and to learn.","No matter what kind of day I've had at school, I always look forward to golf."],"Nick Jonas":["Having haters is just a part of the business, and the more haters you have, the more people like you - that's how I view it, because I try to see the positive in things.","I keep my political views to myself.","It sounds funny, but my biggest fear is that I'm not perfect. I'm a perfectionist, and I get upset when things go wrong or when I don't do well.","I love pizza; you can't really go wrong with pizza.","The tricky thing is, from what I've heard, I'm a bit emotionally unavailable.","Acting has always been a passion of mine, so any opportunity that allows me to do that is definitely of interest to me.","My thoughts on gay marriage are that everyone has the right to love and be loved, and that's the position I take.","I am who I am, and I can't change that. It's not something I've labored over.","I like Instagram - it's a good way to keep up with my friends without having to text or call all the time, and I really like Snapchat.","Find things you're passionate about, and find others who are as passionate as you are and will focus on giving you an opportunity to shine and to have your moment where you can be in front of others to show what you can do.","I think a lot of what you do in acting, and for the most part singing and dancing and everything, is trial and error. It's all about just seeing what works, and if it does, to use it, and if not, to throw it away.","I've gone to normal clubs, straight clubs, and I've gone to gay clubs to party with my friends and fans. There's no difference. I have nothing to prove. I'm very comfortable in my own skin, and I'm thankful to have as many close gay friends as I have, people who have been so supportive in my life and have always been there for me.","I trained myself to not get my hopes up, because there were so many times in the room where you'd be like, 'This feels amazing, this is a hit!' And it never saw the light of day.","The world of music is changing so dramatically every day, the way people hear music. It's different. It's a new day and requires new thinking.","People who are feeling bullied and people who feel like outsiders should talk to their parents and guardians about finding a place with likeminded people where they can feel accepted. That's what I needed, and that's what I found with musical theater.","It's a dream of mine to win a Grammy one day. I'm not saying I'm Grammy-worthy, but it would be a dream come true.","I'm not one of these Disney haters. I'm really appreciative of the foundation it laid for me.","My upbringing was faith-based, but we believed you should love all others as you want to be loved, because everyone should be treated equally. That's helped me have an understanding of people on different journeys and in different walks of life. At the end of the day, we're all the same, because we all want to be loved.","The one mentality I've always tried to have is that no matter what stage in your career that you are in as a musician or a performer or a songwriter or whatever, there's always more to learn.","As far as One Direction goes, and Mindless Behavior and all the other bands, I'm all for it, and if there's ever an opportunity to work with them, that'd be great.","I made a resolution in 2010 to stop drinking Diet Coke, and I haven't had Diet Coke since then. I think it was the best life change I've ever made, because I drank quite a lot of it.","I've always been quite driven. I take after my father.","I love the show 'Nashville,' I mean, that's a show that's pretty incredible.","I kind of date my musical discovery back to when I was 13 years old, getting my iTunes account and using that as a major tool to discover new music.","I get to wake up every day and create music. And even when it's a tough moment as far as career ups and downs, it's always something you're passionate about, and it's a beautiful way to spend your life.","My faith plays a big part in who I am: a Christian guy playing pop-rock music. I'm in a pop-rock band, not a Christian band.","I admire Kings of Leon. I think their records are amazing. Just from hanging out with them, I can say they're good guys. It's cool to see that they get to do what they love. But I think they clearly have an appreciation for where they came from, and it has shaped who they are.","I think my favorite song from another artist would have to be 'Superstition' by Stevie Wonder.","I'm pretty crazy about the Yankees. When I can't actually watch a game, I TiVo it. I am also a die-hard Dallas Cowboys fan. I don't tell many people that because I will get made fun on because I'm from New Jersey!","It doesn't matter if the world is pulling you down. With Christ, you have everything.","I've been blessed to have acting opportunities in movies, television, as well as Broadway, and definitely want to continue to do so.","I'm actually pretty good with computers. I use computers when I'm working on making and producing music, so I do know a thing or two!","I really like scripted dramas. My favorite show of all time would have to be 'Lost': I loved how the writers and producers were able to weave the different storylines together; and the acting in that show was incredible.","My real musical discovery started when I was 10 with Stevie Wonder and the Jackson 5, and acts that I connected with because they were young when they were doing it, like me. Then I kind of came into my own a couple of years later; I found new artists that shaped my musical landscape. For instance, Kings of Leon played a big part in that.","I think part of the beauty of being a pop phenomenon is that you're going 1,000 miles per hour, and it's all happening - and that's also the hard part about it.","I see my career as not just music, but as hopefully an entertainer on all mediums, and someone who can have real influence and make great art.","I've been known to drop a spoken-word bit into a song from time to time. But not straight-up rap. I don't know that I have that gift.","Quality. That's the key. Everything I do, I want it to have that stamp that people like Jay Z, for instance, have on all the things they touch.","Being a pastor's kid comes with a lot of pressure and scrutiny. A lot of my dad's sermons were about respect. It was a beautiful way to be taught about love and two people being equal.","I think that dating other musicians can be complicated at times. Especially when they think highly of themselves.","I have really musical parents, and my dad was always encouraging, but the desire to get onstage and perform really did come from me. I'd never push my future children.","I flirted with Rihanna once. It didn't work - but it didn't not work. It didn't go anywhere, but it was a great conversation.","I would have studied English, but I really don't like to read.","My first introduction to pop music was probably the Osmonds, the Jackson 5, the BeeGees... Then the Beatles eventually. My father was pretty specific about what we listened to early on.","I have a lot of memos in my phone of songs; I've had dreams about a melody. It's always melody first as far as when stuff like that happens - I find that my melodic sense is my strongest asset as a songwriter.","Growing up, my dad was a pastor, and much like The First Family or people in front of the public eye, we were highly scrutinized as a family within the church and looked at as - well, I guess you would call an example of what that family image should be.","I grew up here in New York City and New Jersey, performing on Broadway shows, surrounded by some of my closest friends from the LGBT community. My father, a minister from New Jersey, shaped my view that love is love, that we are all equal.","I feel really fortunate to come from a home that was always supportive and stemming from creativity, integrity and building character."],"Nick Kroll":["In high school, I went to a place called the Mountain School. It's on a farm in Vermont, and I read Emerson and Thoreau and ran around the woods. Now I go hiking with a bunch of my comedy buddies. We talk about our emotions. I also do a lot of writing on hikes, just to get the blood flowing and the ideas moving.","I wish I was a cool guy and could drink coffee black, but I put almond milk and raw cane sugar in it.","You have to have a first job to learn how to act, do interviews, pose for photo shoots, and negotiate how you'll say lines with writers. My first network show, 'Cavemen,' just happened to be one that was culturally reviled.","If you talk to most ambitious people, people who are high achievers, they're rarely at peace with what they're doing because they need an engine to keep moving.","I didn't have any terrible survival jobs. The main job I had before I was able to transition over to acting full-time was working at an after-school program at a middle school teaching improv and standup. So even when I had a regular job, I was still lucky enough to be doing the stuff I loved in some way.","An autograph is actually refreshing because everyone has cameras now and wants a selfie. That's why I carry signed headshots with me, to give out.","I had a world theme at my Bar Mitzvah: each table was a different country. I had a miserable time. There was one picture of me, and I'm wearing a double-breasted suit. There were all these people having fun, and I'm just standing there. I look like a corporate lawyer who just found out he's not making partner.","I think, in storytelling, people want to see triumph, and so it's usually nice to start with failure and see someone somehow rise above it. People like to see people try. And they like to see people fail for comedy, and they like to see people succeed for the drama and emotion.","Meeting someone you admire, and then that person's like, 'I'm a fan of your work' - it's a really neat feeling.","I found, especially with stand-up, that if a premise works, you can make the joke work. If a premise doesn't work, you can't force it to.","The one place I've seen something really come together is in editing. Sometimes you can save pieces in a way that you're really shocked.","In general in comedy, there are fewer people making a ton of money and a lot more people making a living. For me, the goal is just being able to make exactly the show I wanted to make.","Anyone you give a ton of money to is going to go slightly crazy. I don't think comedians are particularly special in that regard; they just are better or more vocal in their expressions of their craziness.","Whether it's corporate investigations or comedy, there are certain inherent truths to trying to get what you want while trying to be a decent person doing it.","My friends, we all improvise together usually. So we write what I think is a good script but always leave a lot of room to find stuff on the day; and we always do find something. That's the advantage to having actors who are, in their own right, writers.","I think my goal was just to do comedy, honestly. It still is. Whatever form that took or takes, it doesn't matter.","Really, I just love doing comedy. Any form it takes is great, as long as I can keep doing it, you know? If I can do my show and 'The League' while also getting to do other bits, that's awesome.","A comedian is sort of like a wild animal. It really just depends on where you catch them. Sometimes they want to cuddle up, and sometimes they'll snap at you. But for me, more often than not, if I'm talking to somebody who makes their living in comedy, it'll be a very thoughtful conversation driven from an emotionally honest place.","My thinking is, if we're setting out to make comedy in which nothing is off limits, then everybody is fair game.","I would be psyched to get a phone call from Al Sharpton. I need to find out who does his hair. It's beautiful. It's a gorgeous mane.","Contrary to widespread belief, I do know something about science.","One of the worst things about being an actor, besides people being nice to you and getting free stuff all the time - but really, one of the worst things is not knowing what's coming next. You could shoot a pilot, and they could have you on hold for six months waiting to find out what is going to happen with the show, and you're locked into it.","I feel incredibly lucky at this moment in my career to get paid to do basically exactly what I always wanted to do. I appreciate that in general. But you know, like any job, a job is a job, and there are days that are going to be boring, or you have a boss you don't like, or people you work with.","There's just a feeling, when you're just an actor - I have great admiration for people who are just actors. I don't understand it, the idea of waiting to get cast, being at the whim of others. I find it incredibly powerless and frightening, so that's why I've been constantly trying to create my own content.","I came to New York and started doing stand-up and improv, and started auditioning for commercials and voiceovers and stuff. My first job was on a pilot of that prank show called 'Boiling Points' on MTV.","For me, I was literally trying to stay afloat. I never actually thought I would get my own sketch show. So the idea that one day I would have my own show is pretty wild. But once I got it, I thought, 'Yeah, this is exactly what I always wanted to do.'","My friends and family always thought I was pretty funny, but I don't know if they thought I was get-my-own-show funny.","Oftentimes the shows that don't work help you get it right.","Wikipedia is a strange thing. Whoever gets there first, you know, they decide. Like the picture: You can't choose it! You can't be like, 'You know, I hate that picture of me doing stand-up from 2005 - that doesn't exemplify who I am.' You take it down, and someone puts it back up.","We all suffer in our own way; like, life is miserable. And I'm not, 'Oh, I'm a stand-up who's sad,' but the reality is that just about everyone is quietly unhappy. I don't think that pertains to comedians specifically. I think most people look at themselves in the mirror and are not happy with what they see.","I won't share everything, both in my act or in interviews. Some of the people who become the most famous are the most self-revelatory, and I'm like, 'No, it's just not worth it to me.'","I did, like, one or two plays in high school, but I don't think I realized I wanted to do comedy until I got to college, and I started doing improv and saw the Upright Citizens Brigade perform and did workshops with them.","When I was a kid, I would do Andrew Dice Clay jokes for my siblings. Like, we'd be on vacation, and I'd just recite Andrew Dice Clay jokes. They seemed to think that was pretty funny. Then it evolved into 'Wayne's World.'","I guess my first big break was getting the hit show 'Cavemen' on ABC. People made fun of it, but it was a huge opportunity for me and moved me out to L.A., where I learned a ton about acting and how much I didn't want to be in makeup for four hours a day.","'Cavemen' was obviously a big opportunity. I learned a lot about how to act and about the politics of being on a set every day. Like, who do you have to listen to and who you don't have to listen to.","I started doing improv in college, and I met Mike Birbiglia and John Mulaney and a bunch of other very funny, talented people who I'm still friends with and work with.","I speak some Spanish. I would love to go make a movie in Spanish. I'd love to be in an Almodovar movie or an Inarritu.","Between podcasts and places like Funny or Die or CollegeHumor, there are so many venues to get the word out. It makes it difficult in that there's a never-ending desire for content, so you have to constantly be turning stuff out, but that makes you better and more prolific in general.","When you start as an actor, you can only hope you'll be able to act at all - let alone on a show that lasts seven seasons.","I got my SAG card doing commercials.","Doing radio commercials was how I was really able to leave my day job.","I can't play video games or games on my phone because I'll go into a deep vortex, and no one will hear from me for weeks.","When you start out, it sometimes feels like you're fighting audiences every night just to prove that you're funny.","I guess there should be somewhere on the Internet that feels like a source of sacred truth. But Wikipedia sure isn't it.","Comedy can't be done in a vacuum, and you can't do it on your own. So if you have a community of people, it's a great symbiotic relationship.","Comedy is so collaborative. You're going to come up with better jokes with people you like joking around with. It just makes sense.","I'm proud of the work that we did, and my hope is that everyone who worked on 'Kroll Show,' it will be a credit that people will be like, 'Oh, you worked on that show? The word on that show was that it was good.'","Usually, one of the first things I think about when I'm developing a character is what they're wearing. I mean, it sounds very cheesy and very actor-y, but it really does help me figure it out.","I do a lot of eavesdropping. That's one of the things I miss about New York: just checking people out.","I think a lot of podcasts have a lot of amazing character work. Seth Morris does this amazing character, Boch Duco, which I think is one of the funniest, most well-realized characters that I've ever seen or heard.","When I first got to New York, Comedy Central was the only place to go if you weren't on HBO or network. And then FX, Adult Swim, and other sort of ventures came up, and all of a sudden there were other places to go, and I think Comedy Central is making a concerted effort to become a place where smart, funny weirdoes can come and do their stuff.","Without realizing it, I think I've wanted to do a sketch show since I was, like, 11 years old. Like everybody else in comedy, I grew up watching 'Saturday Night Live,' and I was doing characters with my friends.","Part of making art is learning how you make it best. I'm not great at sitting down at a desk and writing for three hours. I write best verbally, talking through an idea with people, so I do my best work when I collaborate.","I have so many funny friends that I hang out and do bits with, and the fact that we can hire each other is amazing. I asked all of them to help make 'Kroll Show' the best that it can be. I'm selfishly trying to use their funny genius for my own benefit.","The height of my athletic achievement was in 8th grade when I was the point guard for my Jewish day school basketball team. We played in a public school league and, amazingly, went undefeated. I say 'amazingly' because our power forward was 5 ft. 6 in.","Fantasy football has changed how I watch football because now every game is interesting start to finish. Even when its the Browns and Lions.","The first movie that I ever said was my favorite movie - and I've said for the longest - is 'The Producers,' Mel Brooks' original 'Producers.' The two lead performances from Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder are both unstoppable performances and then supported by amazing supporting characters throughout.","I find Spike Jones' movies to be really very inventive and funny, but they're really sad and touching and really key into the different facets of the human experience.","I was never a western guy, but I happened upon 'Tombstone' one day on TV and was really sort of taken with it. It's one of those movies that, if it's on TV, I can't turn it off. I just have to watch the whole thing.","In, like, seventh or eighth grade every day after school, my friend Andrew and I would watch 'Wayne's World.' And I think it's a great example of a sketch effectively turned into a movie and a story that really works with a good journey. Not easily accomplished, but such a good journey.","Even though 'Kroll' was a crazy sketch show with big characters, one of the things I'm proud of about the show is that the characters were always kind of coming from an emotionally honest place for whoever I thought that character was.","I'm a good uncle, but I'm not a great caretaker. I feel oftentimes pretty selfish within the relationships I have with my siblings and, historically, with what I give back versus what I've taken over the years.","I don't like downtime, and I just am too insecure that I'll not work again if I don't start the ball rolling on the next round of things. Everything takes so long to make and come to fruition.","The more variance I have in my days, the more exciting each thing is and the more I enjoy doing it.","I usually need to read emails to actually wake up. I'll read these and Twitter, and my brain will start to get going about what a narcissistic monster I am. I read on Twitter who is talking about me. I'll also start making jokes for the day based on what I read on Twitter.","Kashi looks like twigs, so it makes me feel like I'm healthy. This cereal has been with me since childhood. Once a year in my family, we had a junk food day. I could eat Cocoa Crisps and Fruit Loops. Now I'm back eating Kashi. As much as I hate to admit it, my mother has won.","I miss the New York bagel but miss the New York bialy even more. It's a great compromise of bagel feeling with less dough stuffing."],"Nick Lachey":["To me, having kids is the ultimate job in life. I want to be most successful at being a good father.","I think that N*SYNC had opportunities laid out in front of them because of their connections with people whom Backstreet were affiliated with, and to not utilize those connections would be stupid. That's just life. They're both very talented groups.","Every day, I wake the kids up. Morning time is kind of 'daddy time,' and that's something I look forward to every day.","I always feel stupid giving advice since I've been married, what, a year? I can say this: Be in it for the long haul and just know there are going to be rough patches. No two people are the same, there are going to be areas where you just don't click.","Marriage is a team effort. Both of us share that philosophy.","There's a lot of reflection that goes on whenever I write a song - it's been a wild whirlwind last couple of years and there's a lot to talk about, and hopefully that's evident in the music.","We can't control it, and we've basically quit trying. People are going to talk, and people are going to lie.","I try to be the best husband I can be, and if people respect that, that's cool. But there's no 'perfect husband.' We just all try to do the best we can, you know what I mean?","We live in a bizarre world - there are cameras in our house!","I tell people, Don't take my advice. What do I know?","We have so much left to experience and learn about each other - it's almost like we've been remarried with the show being over. Now it's a whole new life for us.","There's no bigger supporter in Jessica's life than me.","Her success is my success.","This is a great time in our lives and careers.","It all comes back to the same place, whether she does well, I do well, or we both do well, which is obviously what we're hoping for. It's all good. You know? We're definitely pull for each other.","She knows I'm her biggest fan, I cheer for her louder than anybody.","I tell her all the time I'd gladly retire and hang out with the kids and clean the house. I want to have a good life and great family, and from a professional standpoint I want to be successful, but it's not the most important thing at all.","We're planning on being married for a long, long time.","Definitely, when I have a place and I'm going to be there for any significant amount of time, I want to have dogs. I like a pet you can have some fun with and who does everything you do.","In New York, I feel like, anything goes.","My brother and I are kind of known for doing fairly ridiculous and stupid things.","There's definitely something to the 'Daddy's girl' thing - my daughter can have her way with me pretty easily.","That's what's cool - you don't know what your kids are gonna be drawn to or what's gonna excite them and what's gonna motivate them. So it's cool to see their personalities develop and see the things that they lean toward.","To me, I don't feel like a dancer. I feel like an idiot trying to be a dancer.","I tell my 5-year-old, 'Once you commit to something, stick it out.' I would never want him to look at Dad and think Dad was a quitter.","People used to come home from school and plop down in front of the TV and religiously watch 'TRL.' It was a moment in time that I think a lot of people have a lot of fond memories of. It's a fun trip to take down memory lane because it was a great time for a lot of people, bands included.","I've just learned to enjoy every moment for what it is and take it all in.","I'm so immature and still feel so young. Forty doesn't feel any different than 30 did.","Music has always been an incredibly significant part of my life and a meaningful way in which I express myself.","I've had a wonderful, longstanding relationship with VH1 over the course of my music career, and I couldn't be more excited to enter into this new chapter as resident host for 'Big Morning Buzz.'","I love the rush of doing live TV - you never know what will happen next.","You can't believe everything that's written or reported in the media.","When you're a musician and you come from a singing background, specifically one that focused a lot on a cappella music as I have, it's just a real joy to be around so many talented people and talented groups who have a passion for what they do.","I have very vivid memories of my mother reading to us as kids.","My son is all into construction vehicles like most boys are, so he's enthralled with dump trucks and bulldozers.","Any time you learn and grow, it's an exciting time.","Part of the fun of kids is the craziness, and you've got to embrace that side of it as well.","It's kind of cliche, but communication is the biggest thing in a relationship. You have to talk; you have to express yourselves. You don't want to look back and resent not being heard.","I don't think there's necessarily anything that's rock solid about any marriage. It's all about that balance, especially when you have kids.","I, as a man, don't even pretend to know what a woman goes through during pregnancy.","I think that kids need to be guided; they need to be disciplined, but in a way that's constructive, so that's what I try to do."],"Nick Lampson":["There is nothing nobler than risking your life for your country.","But this Veterans Day, I believe we should do more than sing the praises of the bravery and patriotism that our veterans have embodied in the past. We should take this opportunity to re-evaluate how we are treating our veterans in the present.","One of the most important accomplishments of the Caucus is raising awareness with law enforcement and communities nationwide on the issues of child safety and Internet safety.","None of the things I have done would have been accomplished without a true team effort.","The war on terror is a fight that we did not start, but it is one that we shall finish.","We were also able to do a great deal of work to improve highways, airports and airways, waterways, and railways, all of which are important and have provided a better quality of life and economic development opportunities for my constituents.","We must always emphasize research and development of science and mathematics, and I can think of no better way to achieve this than through our future in space.","I will continue to push for doubling the strength of the U.S. Border Patrol, and to make sure that every cargo container that enters this nation is screened for radiation and potential weapons of mass destruction.","With 1.7 million private sector jobs lost and half a million jobs shipped overseas over the past three years, we must take action to spur job creation and restore economic prosperity.","We are telling veterans they must sacrifice to pay for the pet projects and contracts to campaign donors of powerful members of Congress.","Today, I will vote in support of the Marriage Protection Amendment. I shall do so because like President Bush, I strongly believe that marriage should be between a man and a woman.","The local communities, through their leaders, were able to build a communications network that allowed my work here to reflect the needs and interests of the people within the 9th Congressional District. It's been an honor to do that and we did so successfully.","Such an arrangement would provide Taiwan and China with a forum for dialogue whereby they may forge closer ties based on mutual understanding and respect, leading to permanent peace in the Taiwan Strait.","Mr. Speaker, in seeking to return to the United Nations, the Republic of China on Taiwan will once again ask diplomatic allies to present its case before the United Nations this fall.","Moreover, as we live in an era of the ascendancy of democracy and human rights, we must see that Taiwan has been a vibrant democracy with a democratically elected president and legislature.","More needs to be done to take the fight to the enemy and secure our borders against the terrorist threat. We need more protection on land, sea and air.","Free nations of the world cannot allow Taiwan, a beacon of democracy, to be subdued by an authoritarian China.","Congress should stop treating veterans like they're asking for a hand out when it comes to the benefits they were promised, and they should realize that, were it not for these veterans, there would be nothing to hand out.","As southeast Texas's only Member of the House Transportation Committee, I'm especially proud of being able to help bring hundreds of millions of dollars to the region to create jobs and improve the area infrastructure.","Any veteran can tell you it is already hard enough to see a doctor down at the VA and get the health care they were promised when they signed up to serve this country.","While we face economic obstacles that challenge every decision made in Washington, decisions made merely for political gain must stop. It's time to restore civility in Congress. It's time for action where action is needed - all politics aside.","Despite global economic concerns, other nations are continuing to push forward and invest in their space capabilities. A U.S. withdrawal from the industry will only allow others to surge in their own capabilities, potentially impacting our national security and technology competitiveness in the future."],"Nick Love":["Two things revolutionised life: moving to the countryside and falling in love.","In my real life I live in the countryside, I walk a lot, I shoot clay pigeons, I don't get involved in the film business or anything, and then in my cinematic life, I think I am drawn to the dark side.","I don't want to die with regrets. I like living and experiencing and feeling the whole lot.","I understand working-class culture, tribalism and the ethos of violence, so I make films about these things.","I'm a good little middle-class boy. I live in Gloucestershire or Kensington. I don't exist in the war zone, but it's certainly not far away. I grew up in an area where it is a war zone - south London.","I do show violence as entertainment. Clearly, I'd be a liar if I said I didn't.","I've got a reputation for doing a certain type of film: lads' movies that glamorise violence. The more my reputation as a bad boy grows, the more my life moves away from that.","This sounds really hokey, but I think Buddhism is the only religion that is genuinely peaceful, so I'd try to promote it in a contemporary society.","My mum is incredibly leftwing, and my dad was quite rightwing - no surprise they didn't stay together - and so I had two very conflicting political opinions as a child, neither of which I was interested in taking any notice of, being a sort of little reprobate.","There is no hiding the fact I'm an avid Millwall fan.","I'm not making films for critics, I'm making films for people to go out and enjoy."],"Nick Lowe":["They tell me I produced songs. I just stood in the back, wore a good suit and said, Yeah, that's happening.","The number of contemporary artists who appeal to me is infinitesimal.","All those years we'd spent learning these chops, and all those gigs in Germany where you'd play all night, and along comes punk. It has nothing to do with that. A lot of people went out of business.","As long as my body holds out, I'll be grooving when I'm 70, and not some sort of horrible spectacle.","Be a military flier or be in a band; those were the two hippest things I could imagine.","Elvis Costello had a brand new bag. He was a musician, but he knew all about the attitude part of it.","Going to Nashville to meet the in-laws was the first time when I'd been in America and not been seen as some sort of eccentric character with a cute accent.","I like being a big fish in a small pond. I'm not interested in a huge audience because it brings headaches.","I suppose I was waiting until I was old enough to have some sort of experience to sing about. When you're young, it's hard to sing the blues. Nobody believes you.","I work very hard on getting the songs as direct and examined as I can before I go in the studio.","I'm playing to the sort of people who like the same records.","If a hit came along, I wouldn't be unhappy about that. But I'm a bit too old for that now-doing videos and all those types of TV shows. I've kind of done all that, in the '70s.","If anyone comes along, I'm more than happy to welcome them, but I'm not interested in world domination.","In the '70s, you had to come up with an album every year whether you were ready or not.","The world is full of musicians who can play great, and you wouldn't cross the road to see them. It's people who have this indefinable attitude that are the good ones.","These days, rock 'n' roll is much more about rock than about roll. I don't do rock. But I'm interested in that roll part, because that's the funny little bit that makes it hip.","When punk rock came along, the one thing you were not supposed to be was musical.","When somebody like Elvis Costello comes along, anybody can make a good record with him.","You've got to really know your song, inside and out."],"Nick Mancuso":["I have been an actor now for 40 years having worked in over 10 countries and three languages.","I went to a catholic public school St Helens and learned English by watching bugs bunny cartoons.","I started to act in highschool and became a professional actor at 19.","I was on a founding members of the Canadian theatre movement in the late 60's till the mid 70's and performed theatre from Halifax to Vancouver and all places in between.","I have always been a Malibu Man, like all actors.","The actor's life is the road. Always has been, always will be. That is his cross and his glory.","Fame is everywhere; the 15 minutes are now the dominant themes of our times.","Sex is the great equalizer.","Death and sex are the dominant reality of our day.","At root fame is a sham. I'm not going to live forever and if I am I certainly need don't you to tell me that so that I will buy a car or a box of dried up crackers.","We are the world. We are the people and we deserve better not because we're worth it but because no worth can be put on the incalculable, on the infinite, on life.","I'm not invited. I'm not on the A list, haven't been on it in 20 years and my feet have never trod its red fluffy carpets.","Every citizen in every country in the world now grows up in two nations. Their own and Hollywood.","A few nights ago I went to a Hollywood screening of a small independent film made by Sally Kirkland, an old friend of mine who also did terrific job acting in it. There were other actors in it and they were all terrific."],"Nick Mason":["Part of the gestation of 'The Wall' was this business of alienation from the audience, and so the interesting thing was, what 'The Wall' eventually became was something that absolutely engaged the audience.","Ever since the Beatles, the concept of lovable mop tops, it's a bit of a fantasy, but it's a lovely idea that people make wonderful music and live a wonderful life being friends together. Sadly, life isn't quite like that.","I was brought up in a car family, my dad loved cars and I was taught the art of making an Austin 7 operate.","Watching something being constructed, whether you're passing a building site or whether you're watching an artist at work, is fascinating, and I think that's the enjoyment.","There are so many ingredients that are contained in 'The Wall' that were not necessarily contained in other Pink Floyd records, particularly following on from 'Animals,' which was very spare and sparse. Production on it was much more massive, the complexity of the recording was much more intense.","I have about 40 cars, of which 25 to 30 are what you might call serious.","When you're in the car, how well you do is down to you and you alone-no band, no management, no marketing.","I went to watch my father at Silverstone in the early 1950s, and I've still got the car he was in.","The reality is, like any band, you can never quite quantify who does what.","Of course, with the people you really know, no one changes that much.","But I also enjoy music outside the band. I've been doing production for other people, including Robert Wyatt. Check him out. The album we did together, 'Rock Bottom,' I think it's really lasted well. It's a 35-year-old album, but it worked.","I've always liked a very dry snare and, like everyone else, a very dry bass drum.","I do have electric guitars, because I've always believed, especially when I'm working in the studio with other bands as producer, that there should be a really nice Strat around.","The last thing we would want is for our fans to feel that we're trying to find the 17th opportunity to sell them the same song.","The GTO is such an important car because it's a racing car and a touring car and that's pretty unusual.","I started racing myself and once you get bitten by that bug you really are hooked.","People simply don't have room, physical room, to keep, for instance, 2-inch tape in the sort of quantities that are required to hold a full archive. It's not just a matter of having three or four boxes, it's 40, 90 boxes of 2-inch tape, and very few people have the resources that sort of stuff properly.","The fact of the matter is that 40 years ago, unless you bought the record, you couldn't hear the music. It was such a narrow track in comparison to today.","There were a lot of gifted amateurs in my day. Most of the kids now play fantastically well. I think there are so many bands around now who might get there, but it's a tougher journey.","One tends to look back at the mistakes as the same thing - relinquishing control of something at some point in your career."],"Nick McDonell":["I was brought up to believe you should always live the most interesting life you can.","I'm terrified of getting what I'm not deserving of, feeling that I've got something for nothing... at the expense of brilliant starving writers all over the world. But I have to hope these people who are helping me have integrity.","I'm not good enough to write about my friends, who are all brilliant and sophisticated.","I'm interested in illuminating the enormous disparity between vast poverty and the tiny upper class... This vast inequity is unfair by definition, and I am interested in illuminating that and, where possible, changing that.","In the beginning of college I wanted to be an English major, but then I became interested in international relations.","The more I have written, the less it has been about exploring myself, and the more it has been about exploring the world around me.","I played football; I was a running back, and I took a hit, and I had a hairline fracture in my leg which no one spotted, and I was playing basketball all winter and it got worse. And then I was long jumping, about 20 feet, and I landed one time and there was this big crack, and all the bones were jutting out of my leg.","A degree of self-awareness is extremely valuable... I hope I have that going forward.","Someone once accused me of slumming. I don't know what that means. I play basketball. And through that, I get to see a world that is not smart-kid world.","I knew I loved writing, and I was raised by people who love books.","I'm an inexperienced reporter, and I'm still learning.","I know that I work hard for the things that I do, and I really go to the places that I report on."],"Nick Moran":["My brothers are both 6 ft. 5 in., and if you have younger brothers who are bigger than you then you have to learn the ancient martial art of sarcasm.","Every film has to be the next something else; originality isn't celebrated because you can't market it.","As my mum still candidly says, I was the runt of the litter.","I haven't got any kids yet and it is something I need to address. I'm sure that, God willing, that'll be the next and most fabulous episode of my little life.","I've run out of mates that haven't had a baby now. It does make me think of my parents having a family so young and the fact that I've been able to avoid it for so long. It does make me a feel a little bit selfish.","You learn as much from doing a bad film as a good one.","No one thinks they're irritating. Nobody thinks they're boring. So if you're playing a character like that you have to play them as how they think of themselves.","This stupid celebrity thing is just a consequence of being good at what you do. I mean, no one would photograph David Beckham if he wasn't the best attacking midfielder in the country - much as I hate Man. U!","Someone told me about drama schools, and they seemed like mythological places - you can really go and be in drama classes all day? I inadvertently entered into this world where people wore bicycle clips and did song-and-dance routines in the corridors.","I built up a knowledge of 1960s and '70s British films because my dad used to work nights, and I'd sit up with my mum and watch films - 'How I Won the War' and the films of Richard Lester, Karel Reisz and John Schlesinger.","You want to be appreciated for all your work as opposed to one performance, but I'll always be 'that bloke from 'Lock, Stock'.' You've got to embrace it.","When you've been in the tabloids as a drunken 'It-boy', people automatically assume you're thick."],"Nick Nolte":["Everyone chases a bit of what they say life is about: money, desire... But when you stop chasing, you realise life is a rhythm and it's very peaceful, very quiet. You see, it's quite a miracle.","The only people who ever called me a rebel were people who wanted me to do what they wanted.","Living in a small town, one of the keys to survival was your imagination.","You give up your narcissism, your egotism. That's how you achieve chemistry.","You have to struggle a bit, hustle a little, and be willing to go bankrupt. Once you're willing to do that, everything opens up and you get the freedom. My joke is that next year, I'll make the first film that costs zero dollars.","I've made a lot of mistakes and I don't regret any of them. Sometimes that's the only way you learn.","You don't want to make awards the reason you're doing things.","Birth is violent, and out of that violence is our only chance of rebirth.","I am a good sewer. My mother taught me how to sew.","It's easier to go somewhere if you've been there before.","If you're older you want to tell stories about the pool of human life and living and to communicate, not only to your age group but to do an age group that can begin to understand, that has enough experience of life far beyond the taste of life.","If you get yourself in a hole, you dig yourself out.","You don't learn anything from success. You know, it's comfortable, it's nice, it's warm, but success just leaves you kind of feeling a little bloated.","I have a lot of scars, man. My mother said that a man is not a man unless he has a scar on his face. And what she meant by a scar was some kind of battle that you had to go through, whether it was psychological or physical. To her, a scar was actually beautiful and not something that marred you.","Now, there is always a tremendous fear of science and progressing forward into areas of the unknown and it is a valid fear. Some of the genetic alterations of food are a little edgy.","I never felt comfortable in real life very well. It's always been an awkward kind of thing for me and so when I hit the stage I just sensed freedom. I sensed, 'Here's a place that I can have all the experiences of life and not feel uncomfortable about it.'","We truly have an ancient part of the brain that was about survival when we were prey but we seem to have gone past prey. We eat everything and nothing eats us.","If you feel you have a film that's valid, you stick your ass on the line.","When you are making the one you are doing, you think it is the greatest film going. And then you do another one and it is a great film.","Early on I decided that I was going to lie to the press. The best approach to talking about my personal life was to lie.","We're really all alone. We can't ever get inside another person's spirit, and see the world they do. So we are alone in that sense. The only way we have to communicate feelings is through words.","I like working with writer-directors because you can solve problems right there.","All American males are failed athletes, and it was big time even if it was Little League. It meant a lot to you.","When I was a kid, my dad went to World War II. I didn't know him. I was born in '41.","We're social animals. We've got to get along together. It's in our nature. We're hardwired that way.","Peace, truthfully, is how you feel inside.","If I'm not a successful human being, who I am?","We're very reluctant to change, even though we know that all things change, and especially our relationships are just determined to change.","About the only thing that'll stay with you that you can trust all your life is your breath. Your breath will be there at the very last, because when it stops, you will stop.","I can't get any satiation. My brain is wired in such a way that I - in my research, I probably have a lack of D1 and D2 receptor sites. These are dopamine receptor sites, and satiation is a process that involves a cascade.","You work at a job, and you reach a certain level, and you're a little satisfied, and you keep going at it a little more, and you finally finish it. You go, 'Ah,' all your dopamine receptor sites are full. You're satiated.","Yes, you can get addicted to exercise.","I've never been all that comfortable in real life.","Hollywood is all made up, anyway. Especially the stories and angles that people want to pin on you.","In 'Over the Hedge,' I played a bear, and I spent all this time listening to the sounds they make when they fight and mate, when they're angry or happy.","Violence isn't really my thing.","You're playing a role, but you're still feeling it. You can walk away from it after 'Cut,' but if you're playing a sad or mixed-up person, it's hard to stay in that place for these longish period of times. You kind of have to check out.","Actors are really working with bodies, with their minds, and with their emotions. Feelings, basically. That's what movies are about, going from one feeling to another.","The greatest movie would be the movie that gave the audience a cathartic feeling of transcendence.","In the sixties, you're still thinking you could do something about this slow disintegration of the body.","If I'm going to have to deal, as I get older, with arthritic pain, I don't want to get into opiates.","If you had a cancer on your skin and had it burned it off, you'd wash it and clean it every day.","It's fun to change your body and find new things that your body does because of the weight.","I'm pretty much of a physical actor.","Nobody likes to lose power or reach a point of humility.","Action films have a certain illogicalness to them. They're what we call, when we're working, 'exaggerated realism.'","I'm glad I never went to war.","The truth was that, you know, there was no reason to send me to Shattuck Military School. But it was a disciplinarian school.","Electing a black president was probably the only coup America could pull off.","I'd like to do one European film a year.","American society is still puritanical.","I accept the dying process. I would just like to be as healthy as I possibly can at each step and phase along the way.","The thing about '48 Hrs.' that really isn't thought about much is that's the first film where the black and the white criticize each other.","After Civil Rights, it was very awkward for whites and blacks. We didn't know how to talk to each other.","Americans aren't good at accents, but the English are because their accents change. You go five or six blocks and the accent is different, so they are used to hearing different pitches. In America, you gotta travel maybe 10 states before you can really hear a difference.","Acting is always therapeutic.","World War II affected the male population in a very detrimental way. They were happy to be home, happy to be alive, happy they won, but they could not express to anybody the horror they had been through.","Success comes to you with luck and a lot of hard work, but it doesn't give you the right to be any better than anybody else.","The way you conquer fear is to feel it all the way, and then you'll find out that there's nothing there - it's just emotion.","It's failure, really, that you grow by, although nobody likes to experience it.","You do come to a point where you can get your life in control a bit.","The difference between a murderer and myself is only that I choose not to do it. But I'm capable.","Acting is a bit of a substitute for life.","With 3D, all you're doing is trying to shock the audience; there's no value to the storytelling.","In America, the old are neglected.","Ageing's a difficult thing, moving closer to death, but it's okay. I've had a good time living, so I'm gonna have a good time dying.","Asking for forgiveness is just one of the most painful kind of experiences.","Sometimes the writing can be so good that the actor doesn't really have to do anything.","I've been called 'the voice actor.'","I've been in movies where the movie doesn't come together but the role comes together, or the movie comes together but the role doesn't come together or something like that. Something misses. It's very difficult to make it hit on all cylinders - it's just very rare.","Obviously I had gone all through high school and into college, and you don't do that not knowing how to read.","Women are just more oriented toward feelings - and I don't mean that in a negative way. But with a male actor and a male director, the emotional exploration can only go so far. With a female director, you can end up exploring so many more depths.","When women talk about their feelings, they're not asking for solutions.","I never fought much. It just wasn't my thing. I suppose I could, but I've never got into fights. Not a real one.","I have a high degree of sensitivity, always have. I was very shy as a child. I don't know why that was.","How do I relax? Meditate, I guess. I quit golf. You twist your back and get all cranked up.","I can't ad-lib, or not for long.","I never caught on to being a bully.","No one wants to spend too long inside their own darkness.","No one consciously wants to destroy themselves. It always comes in a disguise. But then you have to deal with it some way."],"Nick Offerman":["I come from a family of fishermen. Fishing is very important to us. We don't hunt. We're not gun folk.","I am a saxophone player.","If properly dried and trimmed, New York-style pizza could be used to make a box for Chicago-style pizza.","I've learned through experience that to trouble celebrities with my handshake doesn't do anybody any good.","I also grew up building theatrical scenery. I spent many years building scenery as a large part of my income and that allowed me to really develop my shop skills.","I have a Kenwood charcoal grill. In our house, if anybody is cooking, it's me. I love making burgers. I love making pork tenderloin. Lamb chops I do on the grill a lot. But you just can't beat brats.","I think it's fascinating that I receive attention for what people perceive to be a level of manliness or machismo, when amongst my family of farmers and paramedics and regular Americans, I'm kind of the sissy in my family.","It's funny, growing up there was never anybody around me with any kind of artistic bent.","My uncles, who are farmers in Minooka, Illinois - I grew up with them and their pickup trucks and mustaches, and to me that was masculinity: big hairy sweaty guys who could pick up a bus.","If you're an original thinker, you are going get told 'no' a lot, and you have to be able to hear 'no' many times from the bankers and trust that at some point, someone is going to recognize that you are an artist and not a can of soda.","Meat is a big deal in my life. I do love breakfast food, but I don't think that's extraordinary. I'm a normal American. We love eggs and meat and potatoes and gravy.","For years I drove a big Ford F250 pickup. That was my ride because two-thirds of my work was wood work, and I'm always driving up to Northern California, where I harvest salvaged trees.","I have a wonderfully hedonistic appetite, and if I wasn't really strict with myself, I'd weigh 300 pounds. I'm not good with moderation.","And what we've lost sight of is that performing manual labor with your hands is one of the most incredibly satisfying and positive things you can do.","I am always so happy to be at 'SNL.' I still feel like a kid when I'm there, like I can't believe I'm watching them make the show.","I grew up among farmers in Illinois and so you always have to have the tools you might need in the eventuality of a flat tire or a broken window.","I'm enjoying the opportunity that 'Parks And Recreation' affords me to exploit my own soapbox agenda, which is to try to encourage people to make things with their hands.","I've had to learn and discipline myself that I'm much happier and much less depressed if I give myself a project. It's just that simple.","When I hear young people today complain about being bored - and the things that keep them from being bored are generally exclusively videogames and/or computer pastimes - I just try to encourage them to go outside.","I would like Americans to make things with their hands. Thomas Jefferson and I feel that makes for a much stronger nation.","When I got to Los Angeles, I started building cabins in peoples' yards, building post-and-beam structures and cutting the joinery for those.","When I was in high school, I would perform every year in those plays and there was something I really loved about it. But I was completely unaware that you could sort of get into an acting career.","I'm very hairy, and men in film and TV are no longer allowed to be hairy.","I have a corn creamer that I love. It extracts pulp and juice from kernels, and I simmer that down into a creamed corn that has an almost mashed potato-like consistency. I add butter and hit it with chopped fresh chives at the end for an accent of color.","I've been working steadily as an actor since around 1998. I wasn't well known in the public, but I was a dependable working journeyman.","My wife happens to be probably the greatest working woman in comedy. I can't think of anyone who even approaches her achievements and her abilities.","When I got my job on 'Parks,' it was so dreamy, kind of unfathomable. I didn't think a job that excellent could exist for me.","I've never seen a theater community to rival that of Chicago. Neither New York nor L.A. has the raw talent or integrity that Chicago theater has, and I think it's because Chicago doesn't have Broadway or the film and TV business to distract it.","If I had more time, I'd watch more woodworking or home-improvement shows, but, not enough hours in the day.","There have been a few occurrences where people in restaurants have sent me a rasher of bacon, which I am not going to turn my nose up at. I never let them down.","We have such an embarrassment of riches when it comes to choice. Do you want to hike in the Alps? There are 300 pairs of shoes you can order within the next 10 minutes. You have your choice of everything.","I always had a lot of confidence in my work and the unique flavor I like to bring to my characters, but you know I'm not a huge dreamer.","I spent a lot of my youth working outside in the elements, and I kind of revel in defeating tough weather.","I grew up in a small town in Illinois, and my dad was a basketball coach. Thanks to him, I have excellent fundamentals in both basketball and baseball.","I worked a lot in Chicago's theater scene as a fight choreographer. And so I do have a lot of experience in stage combat and also in Kabuki dance and Kabuki theater.","You know, even working actors can end up having a lot of spare time. And you can either go sit at the Starbucks and wait for your agent to call you, or you can go learn how to build a Shaker blanket chest with hand-cut dovetails.","You know, it's hard to beat bacon at anytime of day. But I also am a big fan of corned beef hash."],"Nick Park":["I love doing features, but it's a very different ballgame. Sometimes I yearn for short films again, working with a small team, getting my hands on the clay.","The nice thing about animation is that you can realise your inventions without understanding all the hard theory.","I used to get in trouble at school for day-dreaming.","The best films come about through experimentation.","Mainstream animated movies are dumbed-down and sanitised: they make the world in their own image rather than exploring the limitless possibilities that are out there.","Success brings with it pressure to conform. I always thought that success would lead to freedom, but the opposite is true: more people get involved, and committees make decisions, and it becomes a fight to stay free.","When we first sold the Wallace and Gromit shorts to America, people suggested we get rid of the strange British accents and put clear American voices on them, and we held out.","If you respect the audience enough, they can take onboard many things.","Gromit was the name of a cat. When I started modeling the cat I just didn't feel it was quite right, so I made it into a dog because he could have a bigger nose and bigger, longer legs.","Americans like the British kind of quirkiness and the strange accent. They find it kind of cute or something, with a certain charm.","I'm always there at home thinking of Wallace and Gromit ideas.","There is something about the Australian psyche that seems to like films that are slightly offbeat.","We can do things that we never could before. Stop-motion lets you build tiny little worlds, and computers make that world even more believable.","We have to look forward and keep filming new films and not get stuck in the past.","But I think people see 'Wallace and Gromit' as something akin to an elderly couple. These two know each other so well. Nothing can split them apart.","I always considered Ray Harryhausen's work so fine that it was way out of my league: in terms of realism and naturalism, in terms of animal movement.","With some CGI, I think the brain slightly perceives that things aren't real. There's no gravity, the light's not quite real, the shadows aren't quite real.","My father, an architectural photographer, was an incurable tinkerer, maker and mender.","Like my father, I would never as a child throw anything away, keeping old toys, electric motors and bits of broken machines under my bed in what I called my Box of Useful Things.","After studying in Sheffield, I went down to London to do my post-graduate degree at the National Film and Television School, embarking on the movie that would eventually become 'A Grand Day Out.'","I have to admit to not being the greatest technician, but stop motion animation gives me licence to create machines that wouldn't otherwise be possible - inventions that seem real and actually work.","Wallace and Gromit's contraptions are created purely for gags, but we all have the urge to invent - especially children. If they're bored, kids will make something from cardboard boxes, yoghurt pots, tape and elastic bands. Often, those constructions are the best.","My dream was to draw for 'The Beano.' When I was 10 years old, I started drawing cartoon strips with 'The Beano' in mind. I lived in that world. You own a comic, it's yours and adults don't understand it. You could pile them up under the bed, and if you were off school ill, you'd go through them all.","As I get on and films take four years to complete, I tend to have a hankering for very short projects so you can move on to the next idea. It's the ideas I'm interested in. What comes out of your head.","Get out and make films. There are so many cameras now to suit any budget, so there are no excuses.","When I was a teenager, my dad watched my films and told me I could go to art college and study animation. He made me see that I could do this for a living.","There is no worse situation to be in than Oscar night. Not knowing whether you've won is completely draining.","I went back over the sketch books I'd filled at Sheffield for ideas and discovered Wallace and Gromit, except Gromit was a cat then. I made them into Plasticene shapes and started 'A Grand Day Out.' It took me longer than I expected.","It's very hard to adapt something. You end up changing it too much to make a good movie out of it. I prefer to work with things that are custom made for my kind of animation.","My colleagues and I have to constantly remind each other that we must keep our own view on the world while making films. With 'Chicken Run,' we learned how easy it is to be influenced by outside forces, but you mustn't lose the heart and soul of what you are doing."],"Nick Petrie":["I love the beautiful distractions of the world - television and movies, video games, the Internet in general. But I try really hard to avoid them, because they don't help me become a better writer. They subtract hours from my day. And a writer's main currency is time. Time to daydream, time to walk and think, time to sit and do the work.","Reading good books is one distraction that will help you become a better writer. And writing - that's the thing - writing is what will really make you a better writer. Write bad stories until you begin to write so-so stories, which might, if you keep at it, turn to writing good stories.","I don't outline or plan ahead when I write a novel. The more I know about what's going to happen, the less interesting it is to me; and if it's less interesting for me, it will be that way for the reader.","It's interesting what pops out of an author's subconscious when he's not thinking about it.","In crime fiction, I cut my teeth on early Robert Parker, Elmore Leonard, John D. MacDonald, and Alan Furst. I always loved the writing of Hemingway and Faulkner. Cormac McCarthy's 'Border Trilogy' has been a huge influence; I think I read those novels four times.","I'm most interested in people who've lived life in the extreme, which is what draws me to crime fiction.","I try not to think too much about my writing process - I tend to feel my way forward and find more insights that way.","I've always been drawn to the extremes of human behavior, and crime fiction is a great way to explore the lives and stories of fascinating people.","I'm not a big believer in the idea of genre - I'm a fan of any writer who can pull me into compelling characters and stories - but I can't imagine I'll start writing domestic dramas any time soon.","I try to write about realistic people doing realistic things. Or as close as I can get, given that I'm trying to write a suspenseful crime novel.","The minute the reader isn't sure what's happening, you're lost.","It's fun to figure out a way to make something happen that will get the reader involved on a visceral level. When written well, an exciting scene on the page will actually have a physical effect on the reader - your heart will beat faster, your adrenaline will start to flow.","Character drives the story, and the story drives the book. I don't think about where the action should go, or how much there should be, until it's required by the characters. When I find myself adding conflict just because I'm afraid that the reader might get bored, I know I've taken a wrong turn somewhere.","It's odd for me to compare my stuff to Lee Child's, because I'm such of fan of his, and also because it's curiously something I never did until I kept hearing about our protagonists' similarities.","From a purely craft standpoint, a simple character has a single motivation, while complex characters have two or three or more motivations, at least one of which is in direct conflict with another.","To be a carpenter or a builder or a home inspector, you have to have that kind of visual brain where you can sort of imagine something taken apart.","Don't wait for inspiration. Learn to cultivate it.","I find that I do my best work at the beginning of the day, but I'm rarely in a writing mood when I sit down. I'm usually somewhat sleep-deprived, and I always have a long list of other responsibilities calling my name."],"Nick Price":["Overall the fundamentals seem to be there and he's obviously got a very mature head on his shoulders. He's got a kind of presence.","He's got everything. He' not a great player yet because he hasn't won any major championships, but it's a matter of time. He's an outstanding talent. I didn't realize how tall he is.","The technology backbone is no longer an afterthought."],"Nick Rahall":["Today we thank God for all the blessings He has bestowed upon this great Country and ask Him to continue to heal our land and meet our needs - and we do so through the power of prayer.","For hundreds of millions of Americans who believe in God, prayer is our bridge between Earth and Heaven, our way of opening our hearts to the Lord. Through this intimate relationship we find peace and guidance.","But through world wars and a Great Depression, through painful social upheaval and a Cold War, and now through the attacks of September 11, 2001, our Nation has indeed survived.","Today, our actions must be motivated only by our intense desire to achieve a just and lasting peace. The compassion and charity of the American people should be reflected in this legislation, though sadly, they are silenced.","I believe that the Framers of the Constitution made their intent clear when they wrote the First Amendment. I believe they wanted to keep the new government from endorsing one religion over another, not erase the public consciousness or common faith.","A resilient people cherishing liberty and equality and the rule of law will endure.","Reasonable, even intelligent people can, and frequently do, disagree on how best to achieve peace in the Middle East, but, peace must be the goal of our foreign policy tools, whether they be by the stick or by the carrot.","A free people, free to believe as we wish, free to speak our minds, free to raise our children as we see fit, will, make no mistake about it, endure.","America, 5 years after this brutal attack, is testament that a Nation conceived in liberty and equality will endure. It is a triumph of millions of Americans but it is also the triumph of an idea larger than any one person, larger than any one nation.","As a people of faith, we know that prayer is a powerful instrument. And as one Nation under God, we know that many times our most powerful tool is prayer.","Madam Speaker, I have spent more than half my life as a member of the Resources Committee. In that time I have supported numerous wilderness designations. In fact, I cannot recall ever opposing a wilderness bill.","Our work to provide equal opportunities for all Americans should be a year-round mission.","Over the last six years, airlines have experienced severe financial pressure to leave smaller communities, making demands on the EAS program even greater.","Peace cannot come from punishing the Palestinian people.","Simply put, I believe we should not seek the lowest common denominator when it comes to wilderness and saddle a wilderness designation with exceptions, exclusions, and exemptions.","The President's announcement sounded less like a national energy plan than like a page from an election-year play book. This Administration's plan to reduce obscene oil company profits is to regulate them less.","We all understand that compromise is part of the legislative process, yet at the same time, I would submit that wilderness is not for sale.","Wilderness designations should not be the result of a quid pro quo. They should rise or fall on their own merits.","Wilderness is not defined by the absence of certain activities, but rather by the presence of certain unique and invaluable characteristics.","With that in mind and in celebration of National Prayer Day, today I have proposed in the House of Representatives a Constitutional Amendment that would restore voluntary prayer in our Nation's schools."],"Nick Rhodes":["Style has always been very important to us. We grew up in the '70s. Music was glam rock, punk rock and a very stylish movement.","I got this idea about being afraid to let go of something and being afraid of sinking into a state of almost anesthesia, where you have to trust other people. Just the paranoia of it all. And it seemed to suit the frenetic track. So I just wrote it out and, you know, said it.","You listen to a piece of music and it will remind you of something - it might make you happy, it might make you sad, but it is very emotive. And I think that Duran Duran have always understood that.","The most stylish country in the world is Italy.","For me, a bit of anthropology in the evening is always better than staying and watching the telly.","If you look at the content of songs people write, it's usually about the things they know best.","You can only sleep in one bed at a time.","Obviously with every new album we make, we always have to believe in it and feel we've gone in the right direction.","I find that the older you get, the more helpful eyeliner is.","My ultimate style icon is Grace Jones.","Women's fashion is more interesting than men's.","I suppose that I'm fairly comfortable with the clown hat on.","MTV didn't exist in 1980, but by 1982, it had gotten to be a force to be reckoned with.","The Internet is the greatest tool for any artist to have interaction with any audience.","I'm sure I'm a schizophrenic. The problem is I can't tell the difference between which one's which, which one is the real me.","I felt very grown up when I was wearing makeup, thank you very much.","I think maybe my attention span is too long to tweet.","I'm fascinated with genetic science, and I have been for a very long time. I always look at science and technology because I think that the developments in my lifetime have been so remarkable - and we're only at the tip of the iceberg with projects like decoding the human genome.","I love pop culture. I love to be inside of it, and step outside and look back in.","I think pop culture is the greatest subject matter out there - 'Other People's Lives,' as we wrote about on the last Duran Duran album. Most ideas for great songs come from real situations, something your friend said to you the night before, the girl that just left, or something traumatic in your life.","I still love music - that's never gonna go away.","A lot of other bands have tried to go out there and say we've got views on this and views on that. But some of it I've found opportunist. Duran Duran has always been honest about everything. We've always laid everything out."],"Nick Robinson":["Fifteen is such a weird age to be. Nobody treats you like an adult, but you desperately want to be one. You still have these childlike aspects, but you're just kind of coming into the world.","I'm a big fan of regular school and regular education. I just learn better in a classroom where I can talk to other students. I want to go to prom and dances and have that social aspect.","I like seeing those 300-pound women that toss those discus. I just feel like they're so scary. It freaks me out a little bit to know that there are women like that.","A worldly actor is a better actor. It sounds pretentious, but I think having these experiences can translate back into your work.","I'm very lucky to be on 'Melissa and Joey' because it's a multi-cam sitcom, and it was a nice transition from theatre because it's taped in front of a live audience.","I'd like to start trying different fields of work. I don't want to be stuck in just comedy, and I'd be interested to try to break into the movie business because it's so much different than television.","I don't really have a lot of hip-hop and all of that, so I have a lot of John Lennon. That's one that I really like, and The Clash, the Rolling Stones, groups that I think are kind of timeless.","I grew up playing in the woods.","I don't believe that people die and come back as spirits, but I think there might be some unexplained events.","Acting's not particularly complicated. But the great thing is you can step into somebody else's shoes without dealing with the consequences. It's very therapeutic in that way.","I usually get down with a little Violent Femmes in the summer. You know, 'Blister In The Sun.'","We were in Chagrin Falls, Ohio. It's a nice town, but it's aggressively quaint. They've got a popcorn shop above a waterfall and parades that come through town. It's all-American.","I actually grew up watching 'Survivorman' and Bear Grylls. I know that pine needles are a good source of vitamin C and just random facts from watching the stuff.","I realized I really enjoyed theatre, so I did shows up in Seattle like 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and 'Lost in Yonkers.'","My cousin was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, and it's just a really tragic disease, and as of yet there is no cure, so I feel I want to get it as much publicity to do it as I can."],"Nick Saban":["When you invest your time, you make a goal and a decision of something that you want to accomplish. Whether it's make good grades in school, be a good athlete, be a good person, go down and do some community service and help somebody who's in need, whatever it is you choose to do, you're investing your time in that.","One thing about championship teams is that they're resilient. No matter what is thrown at them, no matter how deep the hole, they find a way to bounce back and overcome adversity.","We all have anxiety about things. We all have little insecurities, but eventually you have to face your fears if you want to be successful, and everybody has some fear of failure.","We create a standard for how we want to do things, and everybody's got to buy into that standard or you really can't have any team chemistry.","What makes Freddy Krueger such a horrible character? What makes him scare you to death? You can't get rid of the guy. He never goes away.","When you have the ability to affect other people and be somebody that somebody wants to emulate, care enough to help somebody else for their benefit, that's what makes you a good teammate, and that's what everybody's looking for.","I don't want people to think I'm not happy when we win - I am. But there's a difference between being happy for the feeling of accomplishing something and being overjoyed and feeling, 'This is it - we conquered the world.' We didn't. We just won a game.","Golf is a great example to me. Golf is a metaphor of life. I mean, every shot. You have this beautiful hole, this beautiful opportunity to get a good score.","I think when you win the national championship, it works throughout your team. Where human nature is to say, I did well. I got my quota this month. Now do I get some time off? Do I get a bonus? Do I get to go on a cruise? But it's not to keep trying to be the best. That's not necessarily human nature.","Mediocre people don't like high achievers, and high achievers don't like mediocre people.","I don't know if I'm different from everybody else, but there's really only two things to me that are really, really important - recruiting good players in the program and developing those players once they get here.","I think people who grow up in one particular environment, like the Alabama-Auburn game, they don't ever get the same appreciation for the Ohio State-Michigan game or the Michigan State-Notre Dame game or the Michigan-Michigan State game, the Browns and the Steelers.","When people have success, one of two things happen. They either get really satisfied and want to keep thinking about it and talking about what they did, or the success becomes a little addictive, and it makes them want to keep having more.","I think a lot of times you have to face your fears. I think everybody has to face their fears.","If you're a coach, you're a teacher.","I guess I'm motivated by the fear of failure to some degree and knowing what can happen when you don't do things the way you need to do them to have success.","I always ask myself the question, do you like to win, or do you hate to lose?","The thing I like about college football so much is you can affect these guys a lot more when they are 18-22, 23 years old in terms of people and having a chance to be more successful. They are still a value type development, where you have a chance to help them mature a bit and help them be a little more successful in life.","College football is the only game in the country, of any kind, that the college game is longer than the pro game.","You can blame the other guy for saying it, or you can look at yourself and say, 'I must have contributed to this.'","I certainly like to win. But I really hate to lose. So when you think about that, you're always motivated to, 'I don't want to lose the next game. I don't want to lose the next game.'","I feel like I've been very blessed to have some great mentors through the years, starting with Don James, who was my college coach, who really inspired me to want to be a coach, which is not something that I really had in mind.","When you play quarterback, you have to process information quickly, get the ball out of your hand to the right guy.","I played so long ago, I don't think anybody even knew you could transfer. I don't think they knew anything about it.","All I know is that if we play well, we control our own destiny in terms of what we do.","I've had a lot more success helping guys then just being punitive.","I'm not going to be the Alabama coach.","It's never OK to lose a game.","There's certain things that I was taught growing up about not quitting and seeing things through. I think if I would have come home and told my dad that I was going to quit the team, I think he would have kicked me out of the house. I don't think I'd have a place to stay.","I enjoyed the NFL. I respected the players. It was a great opportunity to learn a lot of things, but the challenges were a little different, and it didn't seem that you could control your own destiny, especially in terms of how you could bring players to the team.","I think the worst thing a player can do is just not be yourself.","You get excited about getting married, aight, but after you're married for awhile, you gotta have a process to make it work, aight.","Once you get good, you need a total disposition about staying good.","I don't try to sensationalize anybody. I'm not trying to entertain. I'm trying to give information and give access to me and tell about our program.","It's a free country. I know we have a lot of regulations in the world right now in what we can and can't do. I would rather our people be responsible and not have to be regulated.","First of all, you've got to have a vision of 'What kind of program do I want to have?' Then you've got to have a plan to implement it. Then you've got to set the example that you want, develop the principles and values that are important, and get people to buy into it.","There's two parts of leadership. You've got to be a good leader - you've got to be somebody that people want to emulate and care about the other people. But the other guys that you have have to accept their leadership. They have to respond to it. That's the chemistry that you never know how that is going to happen.","Teachers are always trying to inspire people to do better, to learn, to grow. That's what we do, and we're proud of the success we've had here doing that, and it's something we'll certainly continue to do.","I don't know that there's any particular scientific evidence that you could say, more guys get hurt in this offense versus that one, or hurry-up, or whatever, but everything that we've ever done in the NCAA is about exposure. How many exposures does a player get?","Soccer is a continuous game, rugby is a continuous game, but for the physical elements that are involved in playing a football game and the number of plays that you play, I don't know that it was ever intended to be a continuous game.","I think I'm pretty misunderstood, because I'm not just about football.","I don't think I'm complicated at all. I'm not political, and I'm not trying to be diplomatic. I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, and I don't say bad things about people. There is no agenda. There's no trying to fool somebody.","Now, everybody always says there's no 'I' in team, but there is an 'I' in win, because the individuals make the team what it is, and how they think and what they do is important to the team. So when you act like the individual is not important, well, it is damn important who these people are and what they are.","Steph Curry is special in terms of the kind of competitor he is.","I don't believe you name a starter until the starter wins the team.","I think there's a certain pride people have in competition.","You can't allow yourself to be vulnerable.","My wife goes to Birmingham five times a week. My mom lives in Birmingham now after moving from Myrtle Beach. It's not just the job. A lot of people don't get that. My life is here.","One thing I always tell players is that there are three bad things: Nothing good happens after midnight, nothing good happens when you're around guns unless you're going hunting, and you don't want to mess around with women that you don't know because a lot of times, bad things happen.","It's been our goal as a program to always give our players the best opportunity to be successful, whether it's personally, academically, or athletically.","If I say I like one person, that means everybody that voted for the other person doesn't like me. So, why would I do that?","I want what's best for our country. I'm not sure I can figure that out.","I want what's best for people who want to improve the quality of their life. I hope whoever our leader is will do all that he can do to make our country safe and improve the quality of life for a lot of the people we have in our country, and I don't think I am qualified to determine who that should be.","There needs to be somebody that looks out for what's best for the game, not what's best for the Big 10 or what's best for the SEC or what's best for Jim Harbaugh, but what's best for the game of college football - the integrity of the game, the coaches, the players, and the people that play it.","There needs to be a college football commissioner.","When I talk about a successful program, define that. It's not just winning the national championship every year because nobody can do that.","I loved it at LSU.","I just want everybody to know that I'm opposed to an unauthorized biography on anybody.","I don't ever want the players to relax in a game.","One of these days when I'm finished coaching at Alabama, I'll write an authorized book because there's only one expert on my life, and guess who that is... me. And there won't be any misinformation. There won't be any false statements. There won't be any hearsay. There won't be any expert analysis from anybody else. It will be the real deal.","Mick Jagger can sing. Mick Jagger is a great entertainer.","I never want to discontinue giving kids opportunities.","You wear your team out, and it's hard to get them back.","You can control your own destiny a little bit better in college. It's hard to control all the variables, especially with the salary cap and things like that, in pro football. You can't keep your team together, and you are going to have more changes all the time. Personnel decisions aren't always made by you, especially who you bring to your team.","I think you have to be more flexible to be a pro coach because once you pay the guy the money, whether he can backpedal the way you want him to or whatever, his style of play may not suit you, but you still are going to play him, and he is going to be a part of your team.","It's great to see our players get some of their dreams come true.","Our players get scrutinized pretty hard at Alabama.","Rex Ryan does a lot of the same kind of stuff that we do in terms of how they play in the secondary and what they do.","My wife gets so mad at me because I don't like to cook on the grill.","As a coach, when it comes to football players, we're trying to change their behavior and make them better. As people, we're trying to change their behavior and make them better.","Bill Belichick was probably the most organized coach that I've ever been involved with.","We played in a number of these neutral site games, I would call them, whether it's a playoff game, a bowl game, or one of these kickoff classic type things, which I think is helpful to, you know, our players in terms of playing some place that's not really a home game for them.","George Perles at Michigan State was the first coach that gave me responsibility as far as being a coordinator. I learned a lot from that experience.","Honesty and integrity is an important part of our character, my character.","If we'd had Drew Brees, I might still be in Miami.","I think center is a critical position.","I think anytime you play somebody on a yearly basis, you develop a history for what they like to do.","Everybody thinks when I say a guy is a good game manager, that's a negative, but I think it's a real positive. You have the ball in your hand every time when you're a quarterback. Whether you're handing it off or throwing to somebody, I think that's extremely important."],"Nick Sagan":["It goes back to the starfish. That's when the light bulb really popped over my head. We'd found one on the beach, and I was struck by what astonishing creatures they are, talking with Dad about how they regenerate.","Something my father dearly loved is the scientific method, and it's founded in this element of humility. The idea is that you pursue the truth wherever it goes; you need to evidence, and you can - you see if it's repeatable.","Dad was a world-famous astronomer; Mom was the artist who drew the iconic Pioneer plaque.","I've met secular humanists who grew up in evangelical households, for whom 'Cosmos' was their first exposure to a scientific way of viewing the world.","Dad was a difference maker. He reached out to people. He took them by the awe and wonder we feel over the most important questions we can think to imagine. He pulled them away from blind faith, away from pseudoscience, toward a deeper, richer understanding of the universe.","My father was not only a planetary scientist and a great popularizer of science, but he thought very deeply about the world. He was a scholar, he studied history. He taught a class in critical thinking, and he was very, very aware of the directions we might go.","There is a danger, increasingly, that we're in a post-fact society where it seems my ignorance is as good as your facts.","Science is a wonderful way of getting out what's real.","Here on Earth, we've found organisms that thrive in environmental conditions we would have once thought uninhabitable. The presence of these extremophiles suggests that life could potentially take hold on worlds other than our own.","American sci-fi has fallen into the doldrums in part because of the anti-science sentiment that's so prevalent in our culture lately.","British and Canadian sci-fi strikes me as more forward-looking than its American counterpart, as evidenced by the success of Iain M. Banks, Charlie Stross, Robert Charles Wilson, and Cory Doctorow.","For a genre that's about looking to the future, science fiction has sure been looking backwards lately. Nostalgia is what sells best, with readers spending their money on movie tie-in novels and sequels to long-running series.","We have not been asking the serious questions about the future of our species, questions sci-fi regularly explores by showing us the best and worst of what could be.","Humans having any kind of sporting chance against hostile alien invaders armed with superior technology - Good luck. If they're advanced enough to cross the enormous distances of interstellar space, they're advanced enough to wipe us out without breaking whatever in their physiology passes for a sweat.","Beyond 'Contact,' I think there's something compelling about 'District 9.'","Human divisions would be child's play for any reasonably competent alien overlord to exploit - check the masterful 'Twilight Zone' episode 'The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street' for an example of how that might play out.","We're so bitterly divided these days, the appearance of a true 'other' might be the best chance of bringing us all together.","Astonishingly powerful and poignant, 'Gravity' is the rarest of rares: a space survival film informed by a genuine reverence for the awe-inspiring cosmos we inhabit.","'Life in space is impossible,' we're warned, and amidst the hypnotic beauty of these heavens, we become painfully aware of what a hostile environment space is, how unforgiving, how unsympathetic to human desires.","Bringing the astronaut's nightmare to life so vividly is a remarkable accomplishment but Alfonso and Jonas Cuaron want more than just the adrenaline ride - they're feeding our wonder and inviting us to think deeply about profound questions of existence.","I think of 'Shrapnel' as the anti-'Star Trek.'","'Shrapnel' is based on the idea that we do colonize the solar system, but it's not clean and optimistic. The haves are putting the screws to the have-nots. The story is about the last stand of the last free colony in the solar system.","Higher levels of technology allow fewer people to do more damage.","As a science-fiction writer, I feel my responsibility is to look ahead and see the dangers of what might happen and try to warn people of the potential pitfalls.","I'm thrilled to be working with the Science Channel. A chance to shine a light on the wonder and exciting possibilities of science with such a smart and talented team is a dream come true for me. It's very gratifying to me personally, and it's also a way to honor my family."],"Nick Stahl":["I don't do stunts and I don't think many actors do. For an actor to say they do their own stunts I don't think is very respectful of the profession of stunt men and women.","Well, it was very interesting to play a character and stretch it over such a long time - 12 episodes. I had never done a TV show before, so week to week it was unclear what we would be asked to do.","In my experience sometimes the darker the material that you're doing, the more necessary it is to have some sort of levity around. I've worked on more lighthearted pieces that have been more brutal and tougher to make.","Sometimes you find that there is better material in small and more independent movies. There's more risk-taking.","Oh man. If I had magic powers... I would hope that I would use them for good. I think I would. But I would do something pretty trivial like making traffic disappear."],"Nick Swardson":["If you want to be a comedian, go out. Do a week in Des Moines, Iowa. Try to make those people laugh.","Improv kind of goes hand in hand with what I do. I was on 'Reno 911!' for six years, and that was a completely improvised show.","I started in the club route. I did the alternative scene later on. When I lived in New York, I did the Luna Lounge and stuff, where Janeane Garofalo and David Cross and all those guys worked out of, but I came from a comedy club background. I'm proud of that background. I'm one of the people that really crossed over and did both.","When you live the life of a comedian, it's such a state of arrested development. I can't deal with anything very maturely. I'm still really bad at paying bills or doing anything that would be considered semi-adult. I'm really bad at it. It's weird I can create and run a TV show, but I can't pay my phone bill.","For me, honestly, one of the first movies I did I was always pounding coffee, and I crashed so horribly. So I've kind of weaned myself off. You keep getting second and third winds. But for me, I've stopped doing energy drinks or any kind of stimulant. I just kind of go natural.","I always thought that the fastest way for me to get ahead and get noticed and to do well was to make my act very accessible. When I first started, I talked about family stuff, my dog, my cat. It was all I knew back then; I wasn't forcing anything, but I wasn't like, 'Hey, don't you hate doing homework?'","Comedy is so subjective, you know what I mean? To sit there and technically pick it apart is so stupid.","I'm developing more stuff in my voice, more Nick Swardson. It's me as myself in a sense and kind of in my voice, no accent no affectation. I'm growing into my own persona.","No one will ever be as good as Phil Hartman. He was such an amazing genius, and may be the best sketch performer of all time.","Improv plays such a huge role in finding great lines - you'll be surprised at what comes out of your mind inadvertently. A lot of times it's better than a script you've worked out ahead of time.","Most sketch aficionados have an enormous amount of respect for 'Mr. Show.' I didn't have HBO back then, so I was always trying to find episodes. Bob Odenkirk and David Cross became celebrities, and Jay Johnston - who's lesser known, but brilliant - deserves a lot of credit, too."],"Nick Szabo":["Instead of the cashier and ticket-ripper of the movie theater, the block chain consists of thousands of computers that can process digital tickets, money, and many other fiduciary objects in digital form. Think of thousands of robots wearing green eye shades, all checking each other's accounting.","What proplets do is they look to the blockchain to see who owns them; they are kind of like SIM cards today - they know where they are at.","Let's try to secure everything.","With original cryptography, you are just trying to secure one narrow thing - say, communications - and you are trying to secure it from a third party. But you can't secure it from the party you are talking to if they forward your email; it doesn't matter how well your email is encrypted.","Smart property might be created by embedding smart contracts in physical objects.","Let's try to protect everything that's important to us.","There's a strong distinction to be made between dry code smart contacts and wet code's physical law. So law is based on our minds, our wetware - it's based on analogy. The law is more flexible; software is more rigid. Various laws tend to be batched in jurisdictional silos. Software tends to be independent.","Physical wealth has not necessarily been very secure.","It's completely reasonable, even if some Bitcoin currency purists wouldn't like it, to have credit and debit card payments denominated in Bitcoin rather than dollars, and net settled on Bitcoin instead of on Fedwire."],"Nick Tomaino":["Decentralized consensus technology will reach the mainstream when products are built that both empower consumers to take control of their own data and also offer users great UXs.","The crypto market has set the bar shockingly low for entrepreneurs to raise money, and this is dangerous for everyone involved.","Despite popular belief, Bitcoin is a bad medium of exchange for people that value financial privacy because of the transparent ledger that reveals an address, timestamp, and amount for every transaction on the network.","Ethereum exists because it enables developers to write smart contracts better than Bitcoin in the near-term. Zcash will exist because it will attempt to do privacy better than Bitcoin in the near-term, and the token gives you access to the anonymity protocol.","There needs to be some standards around launching an ICO and investing in ICOs in the space, and I caution all to tread carefully until those standards emerge.","Cryptoeconomics is so fascinating to study because it's a combination of technology, economics, and psychology.","Blockchain assets derive value from their usefulness. Bitcoin has value because people value the payment network. BTC is required to use the network, so people demand it. If Bitcoin continues to be useful, it will continue to have value.","While it's not obvious to people now, in the long-run, the permissionless innovation that Bitcoin enables will ultimately improve the lives of billions of people."],"Nick Tosches":["Mortality applies to every aspect of life. The fear of death is the driving fear of life.","Life is a racket. Writing is a racket. Sincerity is a racket. Everything's a racket.","The things I wanted to be when I was a kid were an archeologist, because of dinosaur bones; a garbage man, because they got to ride on the side of the trucks; and a writer.","To me, music's something I can dance to or listen to. To write about it is always more of what the music represents, or what it reflects. Like an ideal song, to me, is a song that you can dance to, that summons up some darker and greater mystery.","When I was young, I kept trying to read 'Moby-Dick', and I couldn't get that far into it. And I kept thinking, 'Well, man, if I can't read the great American novel, I could never be a writer.' And this bothered me a great deal.","For years, I never really pondered how I came to be a writer from where I came from.","As a young man, I felt a need to communicate with somebody or something, but it seemed in my own particular environment that that wasn't an option. On the other hand, I probably lacked the courage to do so, even if it was an option.","I often wonder if I had the complete freedom to not have to write, if I would write. That's the one mystery that I hope I get to experience.","I don't have a college degree."],"Nick Turse":["Whether I'm trying to figure out what the U.S. military is doing in Latin America or Africa, Afghanistan or Qatar, the response is remarkably uniform - obstruction and obfuscation, hurdles and hindrances. In short, the good old-fashioned military runaround.","The thing that really struck me was how many firms that we think of as strictly civilian had ties to the Pentagon. Companies like Apple, Starbucks, Oakley the sunglasses manufacturer. Even Google, and a lot of big corporations like PepsiCo, Colgate-Palmolive, and Nestle, that you don't normally think of as defense contractors.","The military has a very long relationship with Hollywood that dates back to the silent film era.","Few Americans born after the Civil War know much about war. Real war. War that seeks you out. War that arrives on your doorstep - not once in a blue moon, but once a month or a week or a day.","The DoD has never undergone an audit. In 2004, it actually pledged to undergo a full audit by 2007, but that deadline came and went, and then they moved it to 2016. No one, not even the DoD, thinks they'll actually be able to pass it in 2016.","The United States has been fighting African pirates since the early days of the republic - battles so formative that, among other things, they established a long-standing pattern of dealing with foreign policy problems through armed interventions and also inspired the iconic phrase 'the shores of Tripoli' in the Marine Corps hymn.","U.S. failures when it comes to the Gulf of Guinea are many: a failure to address the longstanding concerns of a government watchdog agency, a failure to effectively combat piracy despite an outlay of tens of millions of taxpayer dollars, and a failure to confront corrupt African leaders who enable piracy in the first place.","What the military will say to a reporter and what is said behind closed doors are two very different things - especially when it comes to the U.S. military in Africa.","It turns out that, if you want to know what the U.S. military is doing in Africa, it's advantageous to be connected to a large engineering or construction firm looking for business.","The U.S. has taken an active role in wars from Libya to the Central African Republic, sent special ops forces into countries from Somalia to South Sudan, conducted airstrikes and abduction missions, even put boots on the ground in countries where it pledged it would not.","If the present is any guide, government-sanctioned, counterfeit history is in your future.","You don't need a digital David Petraeus or a President Bush avatar to distract you from the truth. You don't need to wait decades to have disinformation beamed into your head. You just need a constant stream of misleading information, half truths, and fictions to be promoted, pushed, and peddled until they are accepted as fact.","The Obama presidency has seen the U.S. military's elite tactical forces increasingly used in an attempt to achieve strategic goals. But with Special Operations missions kept under tight wraps, Americans have little understanding of where their troops are deployed, what exactly they are doing, or what the consequences might be down the road.","Secret ops by secret forces have a nasty tendency to produce unintended, unforeseen, and completely disastrous consequences. New Yorkers will remember well the end result of clandestine U.S. support for Islamic militants against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan during the 1980s: 9/11.","Without a clear picture of where the military's covert forces are operating and what they are doing, Americans may not even recognize the consequences of and blowback from our expanding secret wars as they wash over the world."],"Nick Veasey":["We are all so busy and so frantic that we don't take the time to appreciate the stuff that surrounds us.","I love the fact that very often the most everyday objects take on another level of importance."],"Nick Vujicic":["If we went by the world's definition of who I'm supposed to be because I look weird... 'Well, surely, this guy can't have a productive life, surely, he doesn't have a sense of humor. Surely, he can't love life.' We stereotype people in this world. And so... if the world thinks you're not good enough, it's a lie, you know. Get a second opinion.","I know for certain that God does not make mistakes, but he does make miracles. I am one. You are, too.","Often people ask how I manage to be happy despite having no arms and no legs. The quick answer is that I have a choice. I can be angry about not having limbs, or I can be thankful that I have a purpose. I chose gratitude.","Your son and your daughter needs an excellent father more than an excellent college.","Do you know why I love God? Because Heaven is real. And one day, when we get to Heaven, we are going to have arms and legs. And we are going to run, and we are going play, and we are going to race.","I type 40 words per minute on a normal computer with my left foot. And with two cups of coffee, I can do 53 words per minute.","Sometimes even on an hourly basis we need to keep praying and keep our peace in God and remind ourselves on the promises of God that never fails.","I believe if God doesn't give you a miracle, you are a miracle of God for somebody else's salvation.","I'm officially disabled, but I'm truly enabled because of my lack of limbs. My unique challenges have opened up unique opportunities to reach so many in need.","Money can't heal your heart. Money can't give you purpose. I don't want arms and legs, I want purpose. I don't want arms and legs, I want peace. I don't want arms and legs, I want to be a miracle for someone else.","Hope and purpose in this world is living as best as you can and maybe having life that gives back. But simply giving back isn't purpose; it's a branch of purpose, but it is not the trunk or root of the tree.","I really forget that I have no arms or legs sometimes.","A nation that honors God will always be honored by God. I've seen nations that have dishonored God: God has been taken out of schools, the government, the military; and when you take Him out of a nation, how can you expect God to protect this nation?","The pinnacle of the fulfillment I can ever experience for my spirit and soul is to hear from the Lord, when I see Him face to face, 'Well done my good and faithful servant.'","I challenged God. I said, 'God, I know that I'm a sinner. I know that I won't probably have peace until You're in my heart. But I will not let You in my heart until You answer me, why? Why did you take my arms and legs? Why didn't You give me what everybody else has? God, until You answer me that question, I will not serve You.'","It's a form of bullying, in my opinion, to make sure that your kid gets the best grades, the best jobs and all that sort of stuff. I just want my child to be happy. I want him to do his best and trust God in the rest, but I'm not going to bully him.","Hope is in the name of God, the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Hope is when you compare your suffering to the infinite, immeasurable love and grace of God.","No matter who you are, no matter what you're going through, God knows it. He is with you. He is going to pull you through.","Bullies want to abuse you. Instead of allowing that, you can use them as your personal motivators. Power up and let the bully eat your dust.","I found the purpose of my existence, and also the purpose of my circumstance. There's a purpose for why you're in the fire. If God can use a man without arms and legs to be His hands and feet, then He will certainly use any willing heart!","I think 'Jesus' is the most offensive word in anyone's life. When we mention Jesus, He is the only one who says 'I am God. I am holy. I am the only way to a truthful life.' No one - not Mohammad, not Buddha, not anyone says that they were holy, not anyone says that they were God, not anyone says that they faced the devil face to face and won.","In life, if you don't know the truth, then you can't be free, because then you'll believe that the lies are the truth. But once we realize that when we read the Word of God, and you know the truth of who you are, then I'm not a man without arms and legs. I am a child of God.","Often times we feel like either we can't make a world of difference, or we feel that it's not going to change anything anyway. The truth is you can change someone's day, you can change someone's life, but you have to show up and do what you got to do to actually see any fruit coming from it.","We will fail God, we will fail our family, and our family might fail us at times, but God never fails us.","I just hope people see that if God can do something beautiful with my broken pieces, then God truly has a plan for each and everyone of us.","The biggest temptation I believe is to feel comfortable, to feel like you've worked through all of that here on Earth, and are satisfied with this life.","I don't want to be someone's reason to hate their life. I want to be someone's reason to seek something more in their life.","When kids run up to me and ask, 'What happened?' I just lean over and whisper, 'Cigarettes.' And once I was in a car and this girl at traffic lights was giving me the eye. She could only see my head, so I decided to do a 360 in the car seat to freak her out. Her face was like, 'Whoa, what is going on?' She sped off really quickly.","I'm the world 'Guinness Book of Records' holder of 1,749 hugs in one hour. My arms fell off.","The greatest news that I could ever say is that Jesus is Lord and Savior of my life. He is my friend. He is with me wherever I go. I'm so delighted to continue to grow in my relationship to Jesus.","Faith is walking by faith, not by what you feel. You are not always going to feel that Jesus loves you or that God is good, but you know He is. It is the up and down of the journey.","This life is full of great experiences if we only give it a shot.","In elementary school, we all say, 'If you don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all.' In high school, we should say, 'If you don't have anything nice to say, shut your mouth.' So that's what I'm telling high schools all around the world.","At my funeral, if one said, 'Nick was a generous person,' trust me I won't be doing cartwheels in my coffin. Recognition from people is never and never will be a goal. Some people strive for that respect or honor. Living a life to just reach for the position and status is vanity and sin."],"Nick Wechsler":["Any story about revenge is ultimately a story about forgiveness, redemption, or the futility of revenge.","There is part of me that will always feel wrong for any leading man-type, charming guy or whatever. I am not that guy. I am so weird. I say inappropriate things, and if I have any charm at all, it's in my utter lack of charm.","I don't always expect good from people. I always expect the bad and I am pleasantly surprised when they are nice.","Being funny has always mattered a lot to me. It's why I started acting - to make my friends laugh.","I feel lucky to be doing TV right now because I get another chance every day.","I go to movies and concerts and stuff - that's why I think all my money would be gone if I weren't working because I just keep spending it, on that, and CDs, and I don't know.","Personally, I don't go and seek contact with fans, but if they happen to find me somewhere I'll say hello and speak to them for a while."],"Nick Woodman":["Somebody captures an incredible video, shares it online, and inspires millions of other people to go and do the same with their GoPros, and then it happens again and again - and what you've got is this incredible snowball of stoked customers capturing and creating rad content with their GoPros.","Dedicating myself to actually following through was my single biggest achievement.","If I walk up to a can of Red Bull, I'm thinking about Formula One; I'm thinking about incredible athletic performances. And it helps me choose that can over something else to either side of it.","Smartphones are always in your pocket. They're about reactive capture.","On the road and traveling - that's when people are at their most creative.","I feel like in a world where we all try to figure out our place and our purpose here, your passions are one of your most obvious guides.","When I have a difficult decision to make, I imagine myself as a 90-year-old guy looking back on his life. I imagine what I'll think about myself at that point in time, and it always makes it really easy to go for it. You're only going to regret that you wimped out.","If I didn't follow my passion for surfing... I would have never come up with the concept to make a wrist camera.","As long as we continue to execute, everything will work out for everybody at GoPro.","Everyone has an idea over time of what the business should be, and during the formative period, too many opinions could be disruptive.","I come from surfing, and surfing is the worst cool-guy industry of all. I decided long ago to try and kill the cool guy.","I can sell anything that I totally believe in, but I'm a horrible salesman of something I don't believe in.","Keeping people fired up starts with having a really clear vision for what the company is aiming to do.","A smartphone is great for when one person is documenting another thing or another person doing something.","GoPro's capture devices and Kolor's software will combine to deliver exciting and highly accessible solutions for capturing, creating, and sharing spherical content.","My twenties were my practice. My thirties were when I really hit my stride with GoPro and did all the heavy lifting to build the business.","A smartphone is a mobile computer in your pocket.","People use GoPros to capture the experiences they are passionate about.","I was inspired by how Red Bull isn't about the drink; it isn't about the product or the can. Red Bull is a platform to celebrate all that humans are capable of accomplishing. They built a lifestyle movement, a brand that sold this product.","Your passions are a bit like your fingerprints: Everybody has them; everybody's are different. One's passions may just be a guidebook to one's life.","I think our slow, humble beginnings in surf shops, ski shops, bike shops, and motorcycle shops have been extremely important for our success. GoPro is all about celebrating an active lifestyle and sharing that with other people. It's authentic. It's not a brand that we went out and bought a bunch of ads for to create.","If we can become the de facto standard for image capture of unique perspectives around the world, we have a lot of growth ahead of us.","My first business was a retro-gaming site where you'd go and play all these cool old-school games. It was a good idea but ahead of its time.","I get pretty focused when I start working on something. And I drink a lot of water, way more than most people.","I realized that a surf trip on a jet can be like a road trip. If you see a road you want to turn down, you can just go there.","Bootstrapping allows you total creative freedom. For example, if you decide to approach your business in a certain way that makes it a two- or three-year process to get to your first product, you can do that, versus being rushed into it by investors.","I originally started GoPro with the sole purpose of helping surfers capture photos of themselves and their friends while they were surfing. I thought it was crazy that very few surfers had any photos or videos of themselves.","It's very difficult to get any footage of yourself doing what you love unless you have a friend who's a photographer or videographer and wants to document you. That was really the idea and the goal from the beginning: to help people get a good photo, and then it was to help people get a good video.","I didn't want to take anybody else's money. I wanted to do something small that could be profitable from the beginning, and grow that way - and never need someone to write me a check to keep the business going.","If I'm a content creator, and I get recognition for my work, that's going to motivate me to spend even more time on my next production and make it even better.","Before GoPro, if you wanted to have any footage of yourself doing anything, whether it's video or photo, you not only needed a camera, you needed another human being. And if you wanted the footage to be good, you needed that other human being to have skill with the camera.","When I think about dropping team sports and picking up surfing and also then geeking out radio control planes and gadgetry and all that stuff I love, that's what really now has led me in big part to GoPro.","To get GoPro started, I moved back in with my parents and went to work seven days a week, 20 hours a day. I wrote off my personal life to make headway on it.","When I got out of college, I gave myself till I was 30 to invent a product. If I couldn't do it by then, I would just get a real job. And that fear - the fear of a real job - motivated me to be an entrepreneur.","I want to want to go to work in the morning.","It sounds cheesy, but if you are having fun, people will love your company, you will be more successful, and more ideas will come your way.","My friends used to tease me 'cause I'd wear a CamelBak while I was working so I wouldn't have to get up if I was thirsty.","I don't want to wake up and see my kids going off to college and wonder what happened.","I come into work late morning time and go at it until early evening, and I'm lucky that I'm at the point where I'm able to do that.","You know what the best thing about morning ski trips are? McDonald's!","I'll let myself obsess over things.","GoPro is ideal for pro-active capture, meaning, 'Hey, we're going to do something fun, and we're going to capture a video of it.'","I think that devices like Glass are going to do a terrific job of capturing your first-person perspective. And that's what people first think of when they think of GoPro.","Fear drives you a lot harder than success does.","Disney produces fabulous movies around certain characters, and then they commercialize that engagement through toys, books, cruises.","People are watching GoPro content not to decide whether they should buy it or not - they're watching it for the entertainment.","Things that burn very brightly, we wonder how long they can keep burning.","The smartphone killed the traditional camera industry because it subsumed all the functions of a traditional camera.","People don't go buy GoPro for the thing; they buy it for what the thing does.","You don't have to raise millions of dollars to be successful, you just have to work on something you are passionate about.","Now I'm the father of three young boys, I find myself using GoPro to film them more than anything - trips to the amusement park, the beach, the pool - just chasing them around as they grow.","In France, a hip replacement was captured using two GoPros in a stereoscopic 3D arrangement. Students can watch the surgery using a virtual reality headset.","When I was 22, I realised I wanted to be an inventor.","I think that that's something that's pretty interesting about a GoPro - it's the one camera that we know of that you can combine with like cameras to form new cameras. So it's a bit of a modular system.","Automobiles are dangerous as all get-out.","I'm half Puerto Rican.","I feel like I've done a pretty good job of scaling because I got some great mentors along the way that helped me realize I just have to build a phenomenal team around me that makes my job a lot easier.","I lost $4 million of other people's money between the ages of 24 and 26.","As long as you can bootstrap, not at the sacrifice of competitive advantage, bootstrapping is a really powerful thing because it allows you to be totally devoted to your vision.","Viral word-of-mouth marketing for GoPro is massive. Video is really the conduit.","The best way to fire somebody is to compassionately fire them.","The worst way to fire somebody is to let it drag out. It's not good for that person because they're not succeeding in their role. And it's not good for the organization because it's just not working.","The magic of GoPro is that we are enabling the world to communicate in this new way, to express themselves in a new way, and it's snowballing.","I have a GoPro in the trunk of my streetcar.","Losing other people's money was terrible.","I grew up with stories of people who start their own businesses and do really well. So I thought, 'OK, that's what you do.' I can thank my dad for that.","GoPro lets people take other people along for the ride with them.","I learned that most people buy based on emotion, not on a rational breakdown of the product or service.","I wore a GoPro camera on my head for all three of my boys.","You have to ask yourself: how much does any one person or one family need? And when you start thinking about the universe as an organism, it's important that we, as components of that organism, take care of each other and ourselves.","I got an email from the Crown Prince of Norway asking me to talk at a summit for young Norwegian entrepreneurs. I ran to my wife and was like, 'Hey! I got an email from the Prince of Norway!'","I'm just extremely excited to explore the planet that we're living on.","Surfing is such an incredible experience with a huge ego element.","I still drink a couple of Red Bulls every day.","One of my mentors early on was Eli Harari, the founder of SanDisk, who happened to be a friend of my dad's.","What makes 4K so interesting is it captures lifelike cinema-quality video.","I enrolled in a race car driving school, where you go for three days, and they wanted to rent me a video camera and charge me $100 for every half-hour.","In the early years, I would say GoPro's products were not that impressive.","A really important thing when you come up with a concept is that you solve a pervasive problem for people, and you don't try to create a new way to do something that isn't necessarily broken.","You must, as an entrepreneur - if that's your position - be doing things that really move the needle.","I decided that I want to live in a big world. And since then, any time I'm confronted with a challenging situation, I go for it.","YouTube didn't really start to hit its stride until 2006.","No surfer wants to be the photographer, especially when the waves are good.","I feel like I went through the Great Depression. All these companies are being successful around you, you're on that track, and then the market collapses, and you're out of a job. You're trying to save your investors' investment, and it doesn't work, and you sell the company for nothing. It was brutal.","At a certain point, the services that you build around the hardware become more important than the hardware itself."],"Nick Wooster":["I love the idea of the sartorial mix of fatigues and a great blazer.","Getting dressed, for me, is like a window to my soul.","I love Italian food - especially Tuscan-style cuisine.","In Japan, the attention to detail in customer service is an experience that is unlike anywhere else. It's really quite special. I think everyone who's interested in fashion would do well to take a trip to learn about presentation and the way the merchandise is handed to you. These are skills that no one really thinks about.","Not all black T-shirts are created equal.","Great product trumps all. You can have the biggest marketing budget, the biggest show, a perfect merchandising plan, but at the end of the day, it doesn't mean anything if the design and quality of the product you are offering is not compelling.","Fashion comes and goes; prints come and go. Proper camo never really goes away.","A classic fishtail parka, anorak, mackintosh, windbreaker, pea coat, or jean jacket will get you through every season.","A gray flannel suit by Thom Browne or Tom Ford can be worn a billion ways. I'll wear a gray flannel jacket with a white shirt, gray flannel tie, beat-up fatigues, and a dress shoe or Carpe Diem boots.","The Japanese are the ultimate students: they analyse things in so much detail... until they have pretty much mastered whatever they are studying.","I'm really pretty classic.","Oh God, I am so pro-shorts. I love shorts.","You really can't function without a phone or an iPad.","I guess I know how to dress myself, and that's probably the only thing I can do, so it's nice that somebody notices.","I carry both a Blackberry and an iPhone. But for my job, the iPhone is essential because of picture-taking and because of picture sharing.","A Mac PowerBook is a thing to behold.","I've seen a few lookalikes, and that kind of freaks me out, but then I'm not the first person on the planet to have tattoos, and I'm not the first person to have hair or a tattoo sleeve.","I still think of myself as a retailer first, but I also know how to make clothes.","I happen to have an expensive clothing habit, so, for me, designing clothes is a way to kill two birds with one stone.","My advice to young people - wait until it's your turn. Just kidding, sorta.","I actually come from a long line of barbers.","Thom Browne is, in my opinion, one of the great minds in men's wear.","If someone tells me I can't wear something, that's the moment when I want to wear it.","I understand I'm not everyone's cup of tea, and I certainly don't want everyone to look like me. I really only dress for myself.","I think many men are either time poor or have little interest in going to stores. I love stores.","My dad was a mechanic, and I have great style memories of him. He wore, every single day: a blue chambray shirt, Levi's 501s, and Red Wing boots. And that certainly wasn't fashionable at the time; it was basically the opposite. And he wore these horn rim glasses that were very Sol Moscot.","Outside of white button-down oord cloth shirts, Trickers brogues, 501s, and Ray-Ban Aviators, the single item of clothing that I have had in my closet consistently since 1982 is a pair of black-and-white checked Vans. They are the lazy man's shoe - perfect for dog walking and security lines at the airport.","I think with black tie, you can't really do too much. I think you have to pretty much stick to the rules on that.","It's a love-and-hate relationship with New York. Much like Hong Kong, it's expensive, crowded, the weather is not so nice. But New York is home, and I love New York.","I love London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris - there are a million places I could imagine I like, but N.Y. is home.","Lardini is my go-to tailor. They work with me on a lot of personal things, which is nice.","For me, a Thom Browne suit is an investment.","I truly find inspiration everywhere. I always tell students, and young people starting out, that the single most important skill, next to listening, is to pay attention. You never know where inspiration will strike.","I am probably biased, but I think social media is the great equalizer. It gives everyone a megaphone. Young people who might not have had the platform for exposure can now get their ideas out to a very receptive audience.","Fire Island Pines is my perfect escape from N.Y.C. on weekends. Beautiful beaches, great restaurants, and fun people - exactly what I need after a crazy New York week.","Camo is almost like a solid. It is the perfect uniform: you can wear camo in any application and it is always right.","I'm not just a designer; I'm not just a retailer. I'm not just a street style person, whatever that is. I can instead do a little bit of everything.","There are so many more people in Tokyo than in New York, but it's pristine. It's so organized, and yet the address system is in complete chaos.","There's something about the U.S. and Japan: two opposite ends of the planet, two completely different languages, and yet, especially in menswear, they share this kind of idealized way of dressing that is so close to what we do in America.","I grew up in the '60s and '70s when men were required to wear a suit, shirt, and tie every day to be taken seriously. I was at the tail end of that generation, and it had a significant impact on me.","I think the way you dress is a direct reflection out of what you will get out of your day; you make the effort, people will notice. You'll feel better, and those around you will feel better.","To me, how you dress is a way to show you care.","Just about everyone is quick to judge plastic surgery, especially on a man. We've all seen people who end up looking a little scary.","I have been a fan of Forty Five Ten since my first visit to Dallas in 2010, when I was working with the hometown competitor.","Texas has a uniquely warm climate. So fabric weights and lengths of coats are always a concern.","What I love about travel and shopping is seeing how different retailers in London, Paris, and New York interpret the same collection. I like to find the best store in town and take a good look because there will always be a nuance that you just can't get anywhere else.","I think Hong Kong has always had this tradition of custom-made suits, which I've never done but love the idea of.","I almost always wear a jacket, but I like different jackets. I also like funny pants.","I'm so obsessed with Apple, and the chance to work with the people who really created Apple retail is the retail opportunity of a lifetime.","I'm a kid from Kansas, so J.C. Penney was where I got all my clothes from kindergarten to around 7th grade.","Anybody can make a thousand dollar garment because you find the finest fabric and the finest mills, and you churn that out.","I feel like the menswear blogger is a special breed, and by that, I mean they really have brought menswear out of the closet and into the public discourse where guys are not afraid to talk about style, dressing, clothes.","I recognize that, to someone who doesn't know my history, maybe I seem like this guy who gets dressed up for the Internet.","I'll never forget my transition from pleated pants to plain front pants. It was the late '80s. I couldn't get rid of those pleated pants fast enough.","I did this the hard way. I have worked my entire life in this business, and I've done the work - from being on the selling floor to learning to speak Italian to work with manufacturers with John Bartlett. I've done it all. I've paid my dues.","I like clothes. When I realized as a child that you had to wear them, and it takes the same amount of effort to look good or not, I figured out long ago that I only wanted stuff that I loved and looked good in.","I have a reputation that was sort of built on suits and boots, so I'm a huge fan of the sartorial equivalent of a mullet, where you're business on top and party on the bottom.","I have to say, I love the summer, but I don't love summer clothes to the degree I love fall clothes.","To me, a Harris Tweed jacket is the kind of thing you should be able to have in your closet years from now - possibly it was your father's jacket or, even better, your grandfather's jacket.","I've decided I'm no longer pulling sweaters over my head. Maybe that's sort of an old man thing, but if it is, I'm there.","A man in Tom Ford will develop a nice, long relationship with the brand. Ford is very smart about positioning his product. He's a name that is going to remain huge.","I was 39 when I did, essentially, a three-quarter sleeve on my left arm. It was very late in life, which is good: I can't think of any decision I made at 19 that I'd be happy with at 39 or even now, at 51.","My face doesn't look the same way it did at 39. My body doesn't look the same way it did at 39.","Yes, there are probably too many tattoos. But there are too many bad haircuts, too many bad shoe choices, too many bad jeans.","I really like neck tattoos and hand tattoos. They're just not for me.","Instagram is my 401k.","I would never, ever call myself a createur or a designer. I'm more of an amalgamator or a D.J., taking two things that don't go together and making them go together.","I'm probably one of the most fearful persons in the world, but not when it comes to getting dressed.","Some people are born with a caul. I was born with a jacket.","I've always dressed differently. I've always had my own deal.","I went through a Billy Idol phase. I had white hair when Peter Rizzo hired me at Barneys.","Bloggers and stores and publications and brands and houses all need to sort of take a deep breath and relax because no one is going away. The brands aren't going away. The designers, bloggers, publications aren't going away.","I think that good, great things can come at every price.","I never wear a black belt with a black shoe. It's always the opposite: a brown shoe with a black belt.","Dress for your body type and not your age.","Everyone looks better in clothes that skim the body. Items that fit properly make you look better than wearing something oversize.","I got fired from Neiman Marcus and Bergdorfs, and JC Penney didn't work out.","When I was a kid, my parents were happy to buy me clothes; they provided for me.","I did well in school and was able to excel in those areas where I knew I needed to be good at.","I think a lot of gay kids in the midwest or in places not in New York have to overachieve in order to sort of get through the fear of what they're going through.","I always treat camo as a solid.","The only pair of trousers a guy needs are grey flannel.","I am a sucker for English shoes, and Mark McNairy's always have a modern twist that makes them stand out.","Men shop for problem solving. They want something familiar. So if it's a new version of something they understand, they are right there with it and, hopefully, loving it.","In the scheme of things, I'm just a guy who gets my picture taken.","Fit and fabric are paramount. If the jacket fits, it doesn't matter what price you paid for it - you will look and feel fantastic.","I always say, I have been fired from more jobs than most people would ever have had in their entire career.","I always say that MTV cribs is what brought straight men into the fashion world. Once they sort of saw sports guys and music guys had, like, a billion sneakers, they realized, 'Oh, you mean I can have more than one?'","Clothes are an amazing tool. They are an amazing way to hide a multitude of sins; they're an amazing way to be creative. Clothes can do so many things. But at the end of the day, if they don't serve you, it's just a waste of time. Then it is frivolous.","Clothes and fashion should work in people's lives. Period."],"Nick Zano":["In TV, you usually don't get a chance to fix anything. It's always easier to cancel something than fix it.","I think to love somebody every day for a long period of time is the most romantic thing you can do.","One of the things I noticed about the '2 Broke Girls' pilot was that it looked like a new episode in a season and not a pilot, and that's an amazing sign."],"Nicki Minaj":["When you're a girl, you have to be everything, You have to be dope at what you do, but you have to be super sweet, and you have to be sexy, and you have to be this and you have to be that and you have to be nice, and you have to - it's like, I can't be all of those things at once. I'm a human being.","My happiness doesn't come from money or fame. My happiness comes from seeing life without struggle.","Maybe your weird is my normal. Who's to say?","Your victory is right around the corner. Never give up.","When I was younger I didn't have much financially, like we couldn't afford a lot of stuff and I remember seeing little girls' rooms on TV and they'd all be pink. I didn't have my own room, I shared with my brother, so I would have this daydream and imagine that one day I could have my own room and it would all be pink, like Cinderella's.","You wanna know what scares people? Success. When you don't make moves and when you don't climb up the ladder, everybody loves you because you're not competition.","You should never feel afraid to become a piece of art. It's exhilarating.","People face difficulties, no matter who you are. I faced difficulties with a lot of things. I face opposition every day, but I didn't kill myself and now, thank God, I'm here.","My advice to women in general: Even if you're doing a nine-to-five job, treat yourself like a boss. Not arrogant, but be sure of what you want - and don't allow people to run anything for you without your knowledge.","You have to know that as long as you love who you are - your morals, your values, that type of stuff - you're OK.","I don't mind being called a weirdo. There are a lot of people in hip-hop who are probably never going to get what I do. But, by just being myself, I end up touching a lot more people who might never have paid much attention to a female rapper.","I don't mind being called a weirdo.","I think sometimes the fashion world isn't even about clothes anymore; it's about this 'in' crowd, and I'm not into that.","I feel like my entire career and life, I've been judged by people who did not really know me. I definitely think that they probably were right to assume what they had assumed about me, because there was such little to go on out there.","I want to show little girls that the possibilities are endless. That's my goal - to not only do it for myself, but to show them I can do whatever I put my mind to.","My goal in the beginning was to buy my mother a house. Now I realize, okay, if I really focus and become a key player in business, then I can build an empire.","I don't want children cursing. I'm very strict on my nieces and my little brother. They have to listen to clean versions of music. Even my music.","My wigs are ever changing in height, width, color, size. They make me feel happy. Wearing them makes me feel like I can be a different person every day and that is kind of exciting.","I've constantly tried new things, even as a child, and have always been obsessed with pink. Now I'm just a little more ladylike and fearless. You should never feel afraid to become a piece of art. It's exhilarating.","It's not hard to get your way when it's your way or the highway. People either follow suit or they're not around. I don't really like the sound of that, 'cause that sounds like a temper tantrum. I'm just very black and white when it comes to my business. There's really no gray area.","I want people - especially young girls - to know that in life, nothing is going to be based on sex appeal. You've got to have something else to go with that.","But, by just being myself, I end up touching a lot more people who might never have paid much attention to a female rapper.","When I get up in the morning and put on a pink or a green wig, I see myself as a piece of animation. It lets me be the person I want to be, a person who's not embarrassed to have fun.","As a little girl growing up in Southside Jamaica Queens, if anyone would've told me I'd have my own perfume one day, and be able to inspire young black girls everywhere, to go into Macy's or Nordstrom's and see their face staring back at them - I wouldn't believe them.","I think a child may be the only thing that could give me true happiness.","Everyone knows I'm a lash girl by now. When I don't have my lashes, I feel naked.","I don't need to Google myself.","I can rap in a London accent, make weird faces, wear spandex, wigs, and black lipstick. I can be more creative than the average male rapper.","I happen to be a pessimist, and maybe that's a good thing because I don't stop to smell the roses - which is not a good personal thing. I don't stop and enjoy those moments... Always on to the next and never in the moment.","I went through a lot of bullying early on. Girls made my life a living hell. We had come to America from a different country. My brother and I had accents. It was very tough.","Sometimes I want to just pull the off switch, but you can't because if you go outside, you have to give people your all. You can't say, 'Oh, you know what? I'm not feeling good today.' No. No one's trying to hear that. When a woman comes up to you and says, 'Hey, my daughter's your biggest fan. Can we have a picture?' - you can't say no.","My rule is, whatever you were calling me four years ago is what you should be calling me now, because I don't like it when my family or close friends call me Nicki Minaj. To me I'm not Nicki Minaj when I'm with them.","If people are sitting in the barbershop talking about my butt, it's conversational. That's what people are gonna do.","If I'm traveling, I'll pack socks in my bag - really cute furry ones.","I look at rap as an opportunity to act. My head is full of different characters - in each song I'm auditioning a character.","I've always had this female-empowerment thing in the back of my mind - because I wanted my mother to be stronger, and she couldn't be.","I'm thinking of a legacy that I can be proud of and wealth that my grandchildren can use to go to college. So world domination - in terms of providing for my family - is absolutely my goal.","I vowed that I'd never allow any man to control me or to be an alcoholic or anything like that around me, because I don't want my children seeing that.","I hate cameras. I hate cameras and I hate camera phones. The camera's my worst enemy and my best friend. It's the way I convey my emotions to the world without saying a word, so I use it. People always say, 'You come alive as soon as the camera's on!'","So, my happiness doesn't come from money or fame. My happiness comes from seeing life without struggle.","Female rappers get it the hardest. You have to be a girl, yet you have to be just as hard as the guys. I think some female rappers get scared out of the business before they can make it.","My best and worst 'Idol' moments? I don't have a worst 'Idol' moment... I've been spectacular. Yes, I am going to toot my own horn. And then my best moment is every single moment. I'll toot it again!","Like to me, I did the 'Harajuku' stuff. I did the crazy stuff. And now I kind of want to tone that back, and it's not toning my personality back, it's just showing like I don't only have to do that.","I say nice things about Mariah all the time. I tell Mariah all the time how much of a fan I am of her. She's one of my favorite artists of all time... She's shaped a generation of singers.","One of the first production deals I signed, the guy wanted my name to be Minaj and I fought him tooth and nail. But he convinced me. I've always hated it.","I can't see myself without pink lipstick. I can go without it for a couple days, but if there was no more pink lipstick in the world, I'd be useless. Seriously.","I'm a role model now. I didn't know I was gonna have 13-year-old fans, so I've tried to change a few things here and there. But I also know that the girls don't want me to be Miley Cyrus, either.","I've always been the type of person to make everybody happy and get things done. I want everything to be 100% perfect.","People always want to talk about who I was, but I've always been singing, always been experimenting with pop music.","I cannot hold a grudge against Mariah Carey. What people don't understand is that I've looked up to her for so many years.","My goal the whole time has been for people to see me as a stand-alone artist. I came out with Young Money, the biggest hip-hop label in the world at the time. And then it was, 'How do I branch away from Lil Wayne?'","My whole life is about being Nicki Minaj now. It's a never-ending saga.","Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I am like, 'This is a high-top day' or 'This is a bob day,' but when I get my clothes on that's when I see.","The animated bug has bitten pop culture. It makes me feel happy and free. When you don't act seriously, you can make up your own rules.","When people see my makeup, they think all types of crazy things that I'm doing to my skin, but it's makeup. It's the weirdest thing. They'll see contouring and think you had surgery on your nose. No. No. No. Look at 'RuPaul's Drag Race' and you'll see... you can make your nose look... what ever shape you want it.","I'm just happy that 'Idol' producers gave me a shot on the show and to be able to show who I really was, because I feel like I'm every single woman.","I think one of the things I was shocked about was how interested the world is in 'American Idol' and how people, writers, they write about 'Idol' all the time, and I guess I didn't expect that.","I don't put cash in my Louis Vuitton wallet. I have it thrown around my bag - jut a whole bunch of hundreds, maybe $5,000.","Lavender is the new pink. I'll never stop wearing pink but I wanted to venture out.","I'm a rapper... Gaga's a fantastic artist, you know, she paved her way. She's opened her own lane. But I think that I have my own lane. And we never cross. Ever. So, you know, I really don't get the comparison anymore. Our music doesn't sound the same. Our stage presence is not the same. I just can't see the similarities.","I hate formal stuff. I love looking like a doll and all that stuff and playing dress up, but when I'm home, sweat pants, t-shirt. When I'm in the studio, sweat pants, t-shirt.","I don't agree that everyone should agree with everyone's lifestyle. I think that some people aren't going to agree, but I think that when you're mean and when you ridicule people it's a sign of your own insecurities.","I've gotten tons of awards and I believe when it's my time to get a Grammy, I'll get a Grammy.","I know right now she has no idea who I am, but I'd like to collaborate with Enya one day. Of course I'd love to work with Jay-Z, maybe even Phil Collins. I love his voice.","I do have a few personalities. When people started making a big deal out of it, I started making names for these people.","I don't want a wig that looks like a wig; I want one that could pass for a weave.","I've always been intrigued by color and by interesting hair. I was one of those weird little girls doing my own hair at the age of 9. I was, like, getting weird gels and new brushes and cornrow holders. I would tweak and perm at the age of 13.","I think most artists will experience a lot of negative people on Twitter but, thank God, I've got so many followers that I'm not able to see them that much. I'll see some from time to time but, for the most part, I always focus on something good.","Who doesn't love Enya? Whenever I'm in a trying time, she is the calm in the middle of the storm. If I put her on, I'll be in this crazy peaceful state. I love her style. And her harmonies are freaking genius.","I don't have to do things just to please people. It's okay to do what I love because what I love, my fans love. And they're really the only ones that should matter."],"Nickolas Ashford":["Being married is the best thing that ever happened to me.","You move differently than you do when you're filling the stage at Radio City. You have to be bigger than life there.","We call 'Ain't No Mountain' the golden egg that landed us at Motown.","It's quite different, the kind of love you get in a smaller club and the kind of love you get on a big proscenium stage. It's quite different. I like both of them, but I'm in love with the smaller, intimate club.","I needed real help in New York and I had no friends. I looked up at those buildings, I couldn't see the sky or nothing, and I said, 'Well, there ain't no mountain high enough,' and I just started - the words just fell out of my mouth, really.","So you can have your program, but you also have to be ready to change it immediately because there are certain kinds of people who like certain kinds of songs and they like - some people want to dance when you come out, some people just want to be intimate with you. So you kind of feel your way through a show.","I would just sweat so much. I'd be dry when I run on the stage. By the time I got in front of the microphone, it just, just like a river pouring out. I don't know what made that happen. It took five years for that to stop happening to me.","I think I can see people wanting to hear more music-music now as opposed to all hip-hop. You know, which I have nothing against hip-hop. I think some of it is really good. But on the other hand, some of the real great artists are just being lost because they're not getting the airplay or anything to make them inspired to record again.","But I also think it's up to the fan base to call in the radio stations and demand that the more mature artists be played as well.","I've always loved the blues, ever since I was a kid. It has a depth to it that a lot of contemporary music doesn't have. It has pain and suffering in it, but funny stories, too. And it is built on storytelling, which is something I really love."],"Nicky Hilton":["These are clothes my friends and I could wear. This ain't Prada. I don't want to be one of those celebrities that slaps their name on a label and collects royalty checks. Everything on that runway reflects me.","Ever since I was a little girl, I wanted Valentino to design my wedding dress. Valentino is the definition of timeless elegance. I don't think there's another couture house like it.","When I was a kid I had this funny blonde hair and everyone called me 'Chick' because I looked like Tweety Bird.","I'm following my dreams and doing what I love as a designer. I did not want to be one of those kids with a famous last name that doesn't do anything. That is very unfulfilling to me and I'm very happy.","When I signed the license, I thought the media wasn't going to pick up on it if I used my real name, Nicholai Hilton.","I interned at 'Hamptons' magazine. I was 12. I walked around with a pad and was like, 'What do you guys want for lunch?' to all the people who worked there.","I could have just received royalty checks every month by lending my name to a collection, but I didn't want to do that. My name is a reflection of me.","My fashion philosophy is that if I like it, I wear it.","I'm not a snob about which looks are 'this season' and which are 'last season.'","I always wanted to be a teacher.","I got in trouble in Catholic school for rolling the waist of my skirt down.","At night when I can't sleep, I play blackjack online until I get tired or I lose my money.","I love online gambling.","My fashion philosophy is that if I like it, I wear it. I'm not a snob about which looks are 'this season' and which are 'last season.'","I love Grace Kelly. She can do no wrong."],"Nicky Jam":["I'm a real man. I can suffer.","In Colombia is where I discovered myself as a writer.","Vin Diesel is crazy, and when I say crazy, I mean it in a good way. He's crazy about Latinos, and he's not even a Latino. He even wants to speak Spanish. I told him we should do a song together, and he said he was shy. But I said, 'I'm no actor, but I'm acting in front of you. I wasn't scared.'","The way I'm seeing it, God has given me all this for me to realize that this isn't what I really need in my life.","Al Green is something else.","The mentality always in reggaeton was, 'I'm the man.' I made that cool to say, 'I messed up. I'm not the best.'","I had no father. I had no mother after I was 8.","I love to see people's faces change when they hear me speak English, and they realize how far I have been able to go.","To be a guy that disappeared from reggaeton for 10 years and come back, it can't be better than that.","I'm a little bit of everything. That's what makes Nicky Jam so different from everybody else.","Medellin gave me so much. It gave me back who I am: the person I am, the human being I am.","I've always wanted to work with Mana. I've been a fan of them since I started singing reggaeton in 1992.","I have to write pretty songs; that's what gets them on the charts.","Colombia changed the way I write and sing.","I first write melodies that will make people shiver, and then, I add the lyrics.","I do very well with English, and I think I should do that more and take advantage of the versatility I have. I can sing; I can play guitar.","If I write songs trying to top other songs, it's a lot of pressure.","I try not to think about the success, because it's pressure to continue making music.","I was making too much money. I was too young. I didn't know how to deal.","Making movies is great. It was like love at first sight; a whole new, different business. I can see why actors love it so much.","In the English market, I would love to work with Drake and Rihanna. Who doesn't, right? In the Spanish market, maybe Romeo Santos.","I love going to the beach. I like just walking around South Beach, but sometimes, when you're famous, it can be a little difficult.","If you're making music for the U.S. Latin fan, it's important that you sing in Spanish. Even going too bilingual can backfire.","I don't see a Spanish song being No. 1 on the Hot 100. I mean, if it happens, fantastic. But I don't think it will.","As a reggaeton act, I've always felt people are looking down on us and expecting us to fail. That's enough of a burden, and we automatically try to act with dignity.","We made history. Two Latin urban singers on the cover of Billboard is incredible. I'm proud of myself, I'm proud of J Balvin, our music, and of all Latinos.","There are people who compose from very young. That is not my case. I went discovering myself.","I realized that if I did well in Colombia, I could do well in the world.","Colombians, when they love an artist, they love him whether you're up or down. So why wouldn't I stay in a place where they loved me when I was in my worse moment, and they were saying I was a legend? I felt I was good, so I felt it was my home. I fell in love with the people, the culture. They made me feel like a Colombian.","You listen to a song by Nicky Jam, and you don't think about reggaeton; you just think, 'I like that song.' I got old people listening to my music, young people listening to my music.","I want to go into the English market, all the way.","Puerto Rico got too futuristic with the electronic reggaeton. It lost the essence of the reggae music.","Not everybody can sing - that's something I have.","The way you pronounce words the Puerto Rico way, it's not really global for music. Colombians speak some of the best Spanish in the world. So having a Colombian next to me every time I write makes my music more international.","I didn't go looking to Colombia for a dream - if I tell you that, I'm lying. I went to Colombia because I needed the work!","When I'm in that studio, I feel like I'm the king of the world. If I lose that, I'm going to lose a lot.","What happened in my life made me a better artist."],"Nicky Oppenheimer":["Diamonds are intrinsically worthless, except for the deep psychological need they fill.","Any father likes his son to take over from him if possible.","The Kimberley Process is not a perfect construct, and it is necessary now to re-double efforts to address its remaining shortcomings and strengthen its provisions.","I don't think Africa gets as much credit as it should have on the world stage. People tend to think of us as coming from The Dark Continent, where nothing good goes on. That's not true. A huge amount of, as I say, entrepreneurship goes on.","We're seeing diamonds coming back into favor.","I am one of the affluent rich living the good life. But I like to think that I am doing my bit to resolve the problems of Africa and am certainly committed to Africa in the long run.","America is a country of entrepreneurship and great business leaders.","It is only through developing and maximizing all its natural resources that a sustainable future for Africa and its people can be secured.","Diamonds are a key component in the campaign to make poverty history.","We all need to become more customer-focused and recognize the power of marketing to sell more diamonds.","The diamond business has always been secretive.","I am an African. I live there and my children live there, and as far as I understand, they intend to go on living there.","I was never a skilled artist or anything like that - never a rebel.","May I suggest that people in many African countries could be suffering from donation fatigue?","It's much nicer to be known as Mr. Nice Guy than Mr. Nasty Guy. But you've got to have lines - and when you hit the line, that's the end of the story, nice guy or not.","The army taught me to sign my name very quickly, and that's stood me in good stead the rest of my life.","One doesn't necessarily have a mission.","One likes at the point of production to realize the maximum value, and diamond producers are no different.","You can get a diamond which is worth 10 cents; you can get a diamond of exactly the same size, which is worth a hundred dollars.","Businesses need certainty, to see clearly the rules of engagement for investing in South Africa."],"Nicky Whelan":["I did take a huge leap moving countries. People have no idea how huge it is to relocate overseas. Finding your new life alone is enormous, and then starting a new career in Hollywood is so big.","I think the Australian men and American men are quite different. I feel like Australian men might be a little bit more laid back and a little bit cool whereas American guys are sort of 'boom, boom, boom.'","It's such a process to get a show off the ground initially. And then, to already have a second season announced is a dream come true for any actor.","I've predominantly done comedy over the years.","A lot of the time, in the past, I have played the pretty blonde in a lot of roles.","I am a very deep person. I run very deep in real life.","Growing up and going out to bars in Australia - people do random things; cheesy pick-up lines... you got to laugh. It's sweet. Some people come up with cracker lines, and you really can't be mean to them.","I'd never heard of a hall pass until I came to America. It sounds like something at school.","I'm going to go traveling through Europe and see parts of the world I haven't seen. I've spent so much time in America that I want to check out the rest of the world."],"Nico Mirallegro":["'Hollyoaks' is where I learnt a lot of the craft, being in front of a camera six days a week. That's certainly an experience you don't get in drama school. It invites you to be comfortable in front of the camera.","I've really enjoyed my three years at 'Hollyoaks.' I worked with the most amazing people.","When I was six, I entered a talent contest. I dyed my hair blond, had a chainsaw and pretended I was Eminem. The old folk weren't expecting that.","I love film, and I think it's so important for kids to be educated about films and real life subjects that films cover.","Personally, I don't know what I'd do without films.","I'm definitely a morning person. I wake up dead happy, looking forward to having my cereal!","My dad lives in Sicily, so I'm half Italian and half Irish - it's a fiery combination.","When you do 'Mad Fat Diary' or 'The Village,' you always learn about the particular time period, and that's always nice for an actor."],"Nico Rosberg":["No matter how good a driver you are, you have to have the right car and the right team behind you in order to succeed.","Winning at Monaco feels unbelievable, because it's such a special race and it's also my home race. My first memories were of watching Ayrton Senna here with his yellow helmet, and one day dreaming to win the Monaco GP.","I am a demanding person to interview.","It is a burden because I get asked about my father all the time. I just need to accept that he was a champion before me.","I remember my father's last race very clearly when he drove at Hockenheim in front of 100,000 people and I was sitting next to him on the roof of his car and waving to the fans. That was the moment when I thought: 'One day I want to do the same.'","Pressure is always a part of a racing driver's life, but my father helped me a lot on my way to becoming a F1 driver.","Image has an influence on what sort of car I will get to drive or deals that I'm offered by teams.","For me it was a normality having a father who was a world champion. I grew up with that, so it was never extra pressure. And I've never felt the need to emerge from his shadow.","My dad is a great manager. He's not just competent - he's very clever.","People in Finland have also adopted me because of my dad, and that's great, but it's the one language I can't speak.","It's very, very special for me. This is where I've grown up, it's my home, and winning the Monaco Grand Prix is the highlight of any racing driver's career and for me a childhood dream. It being my home makes it all the more special, unbelievable."],"Nico Tortorella":["I've been acting since I was 8 - I used to play hockey and there was a kids' theatre down the street from my house and one day I just walked in and signed up for auditions for 'The Wizard Of Oz.'","I love the consistency of working on television. You don't get that in working on film.","I worked at the Northlight Theater in Skokie, and the Mercury Theater on South Port. I actually did a show there for three years, called 'Over the Tavern.'","I remember the 'Scary Movie' series coming out for sure, and I was a big fan of those.","I went to art school in Chicago for a year at Columbia College. I had this whole master plan of getting into sustainable development and green architecture and construction, so I wanted to go to business school and then get my masters in construction and development.","I don't really get nervous in front of people. I kind of walk into every situation like I'm walking in to meet my peers, and they either like me or not."],"Nicola Adams":["Boxing is like chess. You encourage your opponent to make mistakes so you can capitalise on it. People think you get in the ring and see the red mist, but it's not about aggression. Avoiding getting knocked out is tactical.","Nothing ever stops me smiling, apart from getting beat in the ring.","I'm like a 'comeback kid' - you can't keep me down for long!","Spiders keep me awake at night. If I see one that's too big to get under a glass, there will be big problems. I'll spend the rest of the day feeling like I'm being terrorised by this missing spider.","I love shopping, but I only really have time to do it online.","I only went into a gym by accident. My mum couldn't get a babysitter and wanted to do aerobics, so she took me and Kurtis, my younger brother, down to the gym. There was an after-school boxing class on with some of the kids from school. There weren't any other girls there, but I didn't mind. I loved it.","I want to be the European, Olympic, Commonwealth and world champion. I want the full set.","Anger is an unnecessary emotion. Loads of stuff in life can trigger it, but what matters is how you react. I choose not to react.","Even though I am a woman boxer, I am not just inspiring women; I hope I am inspiring boys as well.","Muhammad Ali meant everything to me. He inspired me to box after watching re-runs of him winning a gold medal in the Olympics and being a world champion.","I wouldn't call myself a feminist. I am just me. I like boxing and acting and doing my charity work.","At the 2012 Olympics, there was a nutritionist in the food hall telling us, 'Eat that. And eat that.' After winning my gold, I went to McDonald's for chicken nuggets and a strawberry milkshake, but that was just for the hell of it. I don't feel hungry after a match, to be honest.","I got my inspiration when I sat down with my father, at about eight or nine years old, and watched 'The Rumble in the Jungle.'","It is really important that we get more women doing exercise and being active, and those that have taken up boxing or boxing training will definitely find that it has a really positive impact on their health, fitness and well-being.","I went into boxing, and I'm bisexual, and I still achieved and performed at the highest level, and I came away with gold and made history, so with that said, anything is possible.","I think the more people that feel comfortable in their own skin and feel happy that they can come out and know that it's not going to affect their job or moving up in their career is the way forward. Just making people feel happy and comfortable in their own job and in their sport.","When I look back, I only do so to see what I've done in my past - my gold medals and the Championships that I've won. Really, I just look to the future and hopefully winning even more.","Just imagine if women's sport was on the TV all the time - how many more female athletes we would have?","No one's ever really cared about me being bisexual, and I only came out because I had always been out; it's just the general public didn't know. I'm quite fearless. I'm like, 'Let's just go out there and do this and see what happens.'","To finally become world champion after losing out in three previous finals is very satisfying. It shows that if you stick to your goals and work hard, you can achieve them in the end.","Every time I get in the ring, I have to give 110 per cent because my opponents have nothing to lose and everything to gain, so I have to make sure I go in there with my A-game and come away with the victory.","Everybody wants that spot: everybody wants to beat Nicola Adams. Everybody wants to be the Olympic champion; everybody wants to beat the Olympic champion. It's made me train that much harder and stay that much more focused. I guess, in a way, I've got them to thank for keeping me motivated and focused on the job I need to do.","I'd love to be the Ali of women's boxing, to retire as the greatest.","In places like the U.S. and Germany, women's professional boxing is already quite big, but I'd like to be the name that makes it bigger and gives it more global appeal.","It isn't just sports people that need someone to look up to - everyone needs that: LGBT people, the general public. To be honest, it's nice to feel that I can inspire so many people in so many areas of public life.","When I was young, I used to watch videos of Ali boxing, with my dad. It set me on the road. I wanted to be like Ali. I wanted to have my own Nicki shuffle and everything.","Everyone is beatable on the right day.","Women boxers prefer to focus on the win rather than the bravado. We've come a long way. In the '90s, you only ever saw women parading in heels and a bikini holding a scorecard. Now we're owning it; we should get some male models in Speedos to do the ring walk.","My family and friends are the only people I pay mind to. It's none of my business what anyone else thinks. I don't even know them, so why should I care?","My mum did really well raising me and my brother by herself. I know it was a struggle, and even from a young age, when I was boxing, it was always to make my mother proud.","You can have someone younger, faster, but if you have got that experience and that ring craft, you can do anything in that ring.","A couple of weeks after the Olympics, I thought I'd pop down to my local supermarket and do some grocery shopping. One person came up to me in the frozen food aisle, and that was it. I was mobbed, and I had to leave my shopping. Now, I either shop online or go very late at night when the supermarket's nearly empty.","When The Queen invited the Olympians to the Palace, I was first in line to speak to her. She said she watched the Games and how happy she was, how impressed she was with the boxing. She told me she'd watched my fight and enjoyed it. I didn't realise the effect I'd had on the whole country.","I'm good at clearing things out. If I haven't worn something for a while, I'll give it away to charity.","If I've got an event coming up, I might buy myself a new suit. I prefer wearing suits to dresses - I reckon I've got about 15.","Yes, I'm always keeping my eye on trends and designers. With certain favourites, I can tell you what season an item of clothing is from. I've been to a few catwalk shows, and I love seeing how the clothes look on a person.","I train for at least two hours, three times a day - weights, bench-press, push-ups, running, sparring, boxing sessions - so I must be burning off a lot of calories. But I don't weigh myself too often - just once every day.","As a kid, I was always picky about food; if it didn't 'look right,' I wouldn't eat it.","Sometimes my brain is saying, 'Go wild on food,' and I'll want to pig out, but I'll tell myself, 'No.' You either want to win or you don't.","One girl said when I won my gold that was what inspired her to do boxing. She was only 12, and that is the same age I was when I first started.","There is so much to learn from boxing, you can never have learnt everything; anybody who says they know it all is lying. You can't - there is always something new to learn.","I would be more wary of boxing a pretty boxer than I would one that looks like they have been bashed up a bit because the pretty boxer obviously doesn't get hit - so that means they must be quite good!","Everywhere I go, people ask me for photos and autographs, saying I inspired them to start training. Boris Johnson says his sons started boxing after seeing me - how cool is that?","Our boxing is not like the men's. It's more thoughtful, more technical. It's not just, 'Get in there and hurt someone.'","All I want is to keep boxing for Great Britain and inspire others."],"Nicola Cornick":["I consider myself hugely privileged to work at such a wonderful place as Ashdown, where I can step back into history and be inspired by both the setting and the people associated with it.","One of the things I enjoy most about writing historical romance is researching inspiring backgrounds and settings.","Anna Campbell and I have already done a history tour of parts of the U.K., and it would be fun to invite my fellow Word Wench Cara Elliott along, too!","When I started writing, I didn't have the common sense to use a pseudonym, so I write under my own name. If I did have a pen name, though, it would be something very historical - something that sounds very sort of Regency... Sophia something.","My husband is very proud of me and what I do. Which I think is really sweet.","I find writing really hard, but then, every author I know finds writing really hard work."],"Nicola Formichetti":["The dark side of social media is that, within seconds, anything can be blown out of proportion and taken out of context. And it's very difficult not to get swept up in it all.","Social networking inspires me a lot and how we are related and connected to each other.","Uniqlo as a company has always developed new fabrics and is always trying to be innovative. The design is simple, so the fabric is important.","I was born in Japan, so for me, Uniqlo is a family brand. My granny used to wear Uniqlo. And my Italian dad wore Uniqlo. I wore Uniqlo, of course.","I live between Europe, America and Asia.","Style has replaced elegance. Before, I believed that style is something a person embodied. But now it's so easy to buy good style if you have the money.","My muse is the digital world.","Fans don't lie. They just tell you what they really think, and they see details that even people in fashion don't.","I think when you start talking about money, it stops the whole creative process for me.","My uniform is usually just comfortable clothing. Being a stylist, you spend most of the day at photo shoots covered in safety pins.","It's so important as a creative person to go out and look for things. Go to galleries, talk to people, read books. Yes, you can just type something into Google, but if you read and interact, you'll have a deeper understanding of the world.","Having plants and flowers in my space makes me feel very calm and Zen. For me, it's important to meditate every morning to be very clear in the head, and nature really helps me do the same thing.","I'm half-Japanese, so I collect toys, like a Yayoi Kusama stuffed pumpkin.","I like places where you can dance to crazy music, like Bedlam or Eastern Bloc in the East Village.","The Internet shapes my life and work so completely that I couldn't imagine living without it.","Fashion is such an insider's club, but slowly, the playing field is evening out. Through social media, everyone can have a front-row seat.","My mom was my muse - she would buy me Italian 'Vogue.' I was this little fashion boy.","When I first moved to London for university, I was already a big fan of Diesel because, in the nineties, Diesel was, like, the brand. The stores were the place to go. It wasn't workwear like Levi's or G-Star.","Japan, for me, will always be my inspiration source.","Actually, I never liked the idea of bags. I would say, 'Why do so many of my friends spend so much money on these bloody bags?' But once I started designing them, I was completely hooked. There are all of these blogs about bags. It's a whole other industry, and I'm really excited to be a part of it.","I am terrible at making food. I love eating, but I can't make anything.","I love meeting people, and I know it's so difficult for people to come up to me and introduce themselves, so when they do, I'll grab them and hug them. It makes their day, you know? I love that, and I get positive energy from that.","I'm not a designer, I'm a creator.","I think old people should just be old and go away.","I want young people to be able to buy into what I design. When I was young, I wanted to buy designer brands even if all I could afford was the cheapest wallet, the cheapest pen, the cheapest T-shirt because I wanted to be a part of it.","I'm not an elitist. I hate the fashion industry sometimes because it becomes so focused on the elite.","I never wanted to work with celebrities. I have no interest. I don't really care about their egos and their publicists.","Working in a store and being a shop assistant, if you don't know what to do and you like fashion, I think it's a great way of getting into the business because you do windows, cleaning, and everything. That was my school for two years, working in a shop, and that's how I met people in magazines and designers.","Thierry Mugler is about the power of glamour and walking straight into the future. He's been a god for successive generations in the fashion industry. He fused pop and high fashion, told a story in style and combined fantasy with reality.","I'm not a typical couturier, although I really respect them.","I'm saving up to buy art. Nothing famous, but every time I'm in a new city I wander into galleries and dream about buying great pieces one day."],"Nicola Griffith":["There are days when I should be writing, and I am so tired that I can't. And the fatigue also affects my emotions, making me not even care about writing. There are days when I wake up so angry I can barely speak, and also days when I am so sad.","If you have the language gift, you can use it as a tool.","Everyone has this notion of the Middle Ages - certainly the early Middle Ages - as being this very superstitious era. I think that all eras are superstitious. We all have our magical thinking.","The only way to be a novelist, to think that you can create something others will give themselves up to for a dozen hours or more, is to have psychotic self-belief.","Setting is my primary joy as a writer, building a world and watching people respond to it.","My first website went up in 1995. On it I ran a feature called Ask Nicola. Readers would email me questions, I'd answer whichever took my fancy.","I'm not sure many writers are trying to reconcile all the things that are separated in our culture - body and mind, urban and pastoral, lyricism and hardboiled, men and women, joy and grief. I tried to do quite a lot, but I wanted to create a serious work of literature.","I want to write about grown-up things.","I'm tired of being considered a lesbian writer, tired of being a science-fiction writer, tired of being a thriller writer. I'm a writer. Period. Story matters to me."],"Nicola Monaghan":["It has taken me a long time to work out the function of ex-boyfriends, at least for me: how they can help you work out what you want from life and from a partner by showing you what you don't. If a man is your ex, it's better all round if he was not Mr. Right.","As a writer, it is my job to tell a story. I don't want to get involved in social commentary; I just want to show issues from a different point of view. I want to show issues from a perspective that may not be highlighted.","Having travelled and lived and worked in many different places, I was keen to come back and settle in Nottingham, partly because my family are here, but also because Nottingham is such a vibrant city."],"Nicola Peltz":["You see people, you judge. It's just the human thing to do - good or bad, it's a fact. Like when you get a coffee at Starbucks and the person is rude to you. My mom always says, 'Yeah, but you don't know what kind of day they're having.' You don't know the back-story, and that's why it's so fun to be an actor and to get into the back-story.","When I was 12, I got a manager, but my mom was against it. It took a lot of convincing. But when I got a job at Manhattan Theatre Club, I think she saw how passionate I was about it and that I worked really hard - and now she's super supportive.","I'll always be the baby in the family. I'm the youngest sister, but growing up with so many boys, it makes you tough. You get teased. There's no tiptoeing around each other. You say it the way it is; you're honest.","I have six brothers and one sister, and I was an ice hockey player when I was younger. I think my dad thought I was going to be in the women's league for ice hockey. But, I totally fell in love with drama in grade school, and I asked my mom if I could get involved with it.","I saw 'Paranormal Activity' on Halloween with all my friends. It scared me, but it was so much fun.","I have six brothers and one sister. I grew up playing ice hockey, a total tomboy, and that's what I thought I was going to do - be an ice-hockey player.","My role is Katara: in 'The Last Airbender,' I'm a water bender from the southern water tribe, and my character is really strong but also loving."],"Nicola Sturgeon":["It's not opinion polls that determine the outcome of elections, it's votes in ballot boxes.","Let us put the normal divisions of politics aside. Let us come together as one country; let us seize this historic moment to shift the balance of power from the corridors of Westminster to the streets and communities of Scotland.","I think it is important the communities are listened to and that their voice is heard, particularly with local government boundaries more than parliamentary boundaries, because you are talking very much about communities. It can be a very emotive thing.","Since I became First Minister, I have made clear my priority to alleviate poverty and tackle inequality in Scotland. Ensuring that everyone can do better in life will not only make Scotland fairer, but it will also make it a more prosperous place.","The truth of the matter is that countries the world over have deficits. Let us remember this about Scotland's deficit: it was not created in an independent Scotland; it was created on Westminster's watch.","We already know that social security is more affordable in Scotland than it is in the rest of the U.K. - spending on social protection takes up a smaller share of our economic output and our tax revenues than is the case in the U.K. as a whole.","Sometimes things happen in life, sometimes they don't. Don't get me wrong: I have no regrets - if I could turn the clock back 10 or 20 years, I wouldn't want to fundamentally change the path my life has taken.","Polls can change; people's opinions can change. Voting intentions can change, and I think it would be a silly leader, a silly political party, that would assume that we have it sewn up.","A good education is the most important gift we can give our young people.","I consider myself a selfie specialist.","One of the attributes Glasgow is best known for all over the world is the friendliness of her people.","Haggis is delicious. It is wonderful. It's spicy, it's tasty, and you get vegetarian haggis as well.","Men - the colour of their tie is the most difficult decision they have to make every day.","Governments in countries across the world have a duty to do everything possible to keep the public safe from terrorist attacks.","I am a believer in people succeeding on merit.","I feel comfortable in a position of leadership, but that's not to say I feel complacent about it. I take it incredibly seriously.","There is nothing in your background that inherently holds you back or means you can't achieve what others can achieve. You are the master of your own fate, and if you work hard, you can do what you want.","People don't want to go back to the days, pre-referendum, when the Westminster establishment sidelined and ignored Scotland. They want Scotland's voice to be heard.","The decision on whether there is another referendum is down to the Scottish people.","I believe we should support people to live, and I am therefore in favour of good quality palliative care.","I am a social democrat - I believe in pursuing greater equality and tackling social justice - but... you can't do that unless you have got a strong economy, unless you have got a vibrant business base earning the wealth that makes that possible.","Glasgow is a great city.","The importance of education is ingrained in Scottish history.","For parents - women in particular - good quality, affordable childcare is vital.","Not once in my life has the Tory Party come anywhere close to winning an election in Scotland, and yet, for more than half my life, we have had a Tory government. That is wrong and undemocratic.","Trespass, the outdoor clothing company based in the South Side, is run by two of the nicest guys and proudest Glaswegians you could meet, Afzal and Akmal Khushi.","I am quite driven. I know what I think, and I know what I want to achieve, but I also hope that people who are asked to describe me would describe me as pretty down-to-earth, loyal, friendly. The more experience I have got in politics, I think the more I have allowed me to shine through.","I worry about the direction of the U.K. and U.K. politics and governance in the event of a Brexit.","Scotland is not a region of the U.K.; Scotland is a nation, and if we cannot protect our interests within a U.K. that is going to be changing fundamentally, then that right of Scotland to consider the options of independence has to be there.","I know you've got to earn people's trust, and you've got to earn it day after day after day.","I am quite hot-headed; I am quite impulsive. Fortunately, it doesn't last very long.","If your pal or neighbour is in the SNP, you're more likely to listen to them than if you just turn on the telly and see me or Alex. The growth of membership is building a politically engaged community base that hasn't been there in my lifetime.","Of course, aid is only one small part of international development. Some of the greatest benefits to the world's poorest can be achieved through policy changes by developed countries.","For me, personally, it has been humbling since I became First Minister to speak to women and girls and have them tell me how much it means to them to have a woman in the top job in politics in Scotland.","To every woman out there who thinks that they might like to get involved in politics or stand for parliament, I say go for it. If I can do it, so can you.","I think Scotland will become an independent country. I've always believed that. It means that if I'm right on that, there has to be another referendum at some stage. But the timing and circumstances of that will require careful judgment.","Scotland has a great deal to offer the world in terms of our approach to key economic and social issues.","Scotch beef, salmon and shellfish are recognised the world over for their excellence and Scottish provenance. People recognise the Scottish brand. They associate the country with quality food and drink, and clearly other Scottish sectors, such as dairy, can benefit from that, too.","Because of lower life expectancy in Scotland - something that we are working hard to improve - the average woman will get £11,000 less in pension payments than counterparts in the rest of the U.K., even though she will pay exactly the same in contributions.","It's very much the currency of discourse on social media where political disagreements very quickly become very personalised.","I'm not going to do anything that heralds in a Tory government.","As a young woman in politics, with few women around, you start to subconsciously behave like men in politics. That comes across as quite hard, tough and humorless, but you're trying to be taken seriously.","There's nothing in my background that would have said I was destined to be a senior politician.","I don't cook very often. Actually, I'd go further: I can't cook.","I think you should always aim for more.","I drove my mum and dad mad.","What a war in Iraq will not do is bring about peace in the Middle East or end the injustices that feed resentment and breed terrorists.","One of Ed Miliband's shadow ministers has said he would never vote for the renewal of Trident.","Do I look like one of the most dangerous women in Britain? Come on!","I've never had a voice coach, but I am about to name drop horrendously here: I did once get some advice on how to project my voice from Sean Connery, which was lovely. It's all about where you breathe. That's my claim to fame.","I and Alex Salmond are not in competition - we are on the same side; we are on the same team, working together.","Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, it is possible for other parties to change the direction of a government without bringing a government down.","A minority government can't govern without support from other parties.","As a veteran of many campaigns, I know how important it is not let up in the last few days.","I'm a politician, and as you know, politicians are rarely very funny.","One thing we've learned is that there's not anything that Nigel Farage won't blame on foreigners.","Thatcher was the motivation for my entire political career. I hated everything she stood for.","I thought if people were going to talk about what I wear, wouldn't it be good if they were talking about who designed it, who made it and if that's a Scottish company, so teaming up with Totty Rocks has been fantastic.","It still annoys me when I read really derogatory things about how a woman looks because you would usually not read these things about a man, and that still has the potential to put women off public life.","Twitter's probably my bad habit.","London has a centrifugal pull on talent, investment and business from the rest of Europe and the world. That brings benefits to the broader U.K. economy.","Equality and prosperity shouldn't be seen as enemies of each other, but as partners. One reinforces the other.","The total impact of the Tory/Liberal tax, welfare and public spending changes has hit the poorest 10% in society disproportionately hard - and women have been affected even more badly than men.","Ed Balls has made it crystal clear that, left to its own devices, a Labour government would simply carry on with the same budget policies as the Tories.","Poverty is on the increase - due to welfare cuts - and demand for food banks has rocketed.","Tax credits are designed to help people who work hard but who, through no fault of their own, don't earn enough to keep their families out of poverty.","It is hard to overstate the economic importance of the U.S.A. to Scotland, and that makes it essential that we engage with companies and potential investors and get the message across that we are open for business.","American companies based in Scotland employ large numbers of people - in fact, we are the best performing part of the U.K., outside London and the southeast of England when it comes to attracting foreign direct investment.","My message is a simple one - the E.U. is not perfect, but Scotland's interests are best served by being a member.","Most people would agree that the E.U. is too bureaucratic, not transparent or democratic enough and that it often interferes too much in matters that are best left to national governments.","There are lots of jobs and investment in Scotland dependent on our membership of the E.U. single market.","The fact is that co-operation between independent countries - to our mutual advantage - is the way of the modern world.","Labour long ago realised it could no longer automatically assume that it would win elections in Glasgow and other places where it has taken people's votes for granted for decades - as we have seen across Scotland at local council and Holyrood elections.","Instead of an end to austerity, Labour has made clear that it wants to impose more austerity cuts.","Voting Labour in the past hasn't protected Scotland against Tory governments.","Too often in the past, Scotland has been sidelined and ignored in the Westminster corridors of power, but that doesn't have to be the case anymore.","The Scottish Government's international development work began in 2005 with a £3 million budget focused solely on Malawi, reflecting the historic links between our two countries.","Scotland's relationship with Malawi is perhaps unique - with almost every town or village in Scotland having some connection.","True gender equality in Scotland - and elsewhere - is still some way off.","Some of the brightest and best women in our society are stifled in their ambitions.","I was very proud, on just my second day in office, to appoint a gender-balanced cabinet - one of only three in the developed world.","When I was growing up, I was lucky to benefit from a first class education.","The teachers who taught me at Dreghorn Primary and Greenwood Academy were fantastic.","I am privileged to count many Muslims among my friends - some are amongst my closest friends.","In particular, I want to set a challenge to public bodies and private companies to improve gender balance on their own boards.","It is one of the little known facts about modern Scottish politics that it is not quite as cut-throat as people think it is.","The fact is Scottish Labour has lost its way.","U.K. welfare cuts are pushing more children into poverty; that is beyond dispute.","Personally, I can think of no greater privilege than to lead the party I joined when I was just 16.","Scotland has been re-energized, and people all over the country have become involved in - and informed about - politics and government in a way that I have never known before. In short, we have put ourselves firmly in control of our country.","An independent Scotland - like all countries - will face challenges, and we will have our ups and downs. But the decisions about how we use our wealth will be ours.","Parties that win elections should form the government, not parties that lose elections.","Any politician or campaigner trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the public won't get very far.","There can be no greater privilege in life than to be chosen to lead your country.","An independent Scotland could afford pensions full stop - after all, it is our taxes and national insurance contributions that fund them now.","The U.K. government sets a cap on how much can be spent on discretionary housing payments.","My early years as a political activist were dominated by the poll tax.","If Scotland was independent, we'd be the 14th richest country in the developed world.","Sporting success doesn't happen by accident. It takes hard work and determination on the part of the individual athletes. And it also takes investment in facilities and training support.","The fact that healthier lifestyles and advances in medicine mean that we are living longer is actually something to be celebrated.","If there are healthy - and growing - numbers of people working and paying taxes, we are better able to pay the costs of people living longer.","The debate around the ageing population should, in my view, focus much more on how we grow the active, working population.","For the Scottish government, the practice of having meetings in different parts of the country is well established, but for the U.K. government, it is a much rarer event.","People in Scotland don't take too kindly to being lectured by a Tory Chancellor."],"Nicolas Berggruen":["Singapore has been incredibly well-managed. It was created out of the swamp, with a strong emotional idea: a safe place for mostly Chinese, but accepting other cultures and other races.","Whatever I own is temporary, since we're only here for a short period of time. It's what we do and produce, it's our actions that will last forever. That's real value.","I am not that attached to material things. And the good thing is I can make choices. I have very few possessions. Luckily, as a man you don't need much... a few papers, a couple of books, and a few shirts, jackets, sweaters. It fits in a little thing, in a paper bag, so it's very easy.","The biggest determinant in our lives is culture, where we are born, what the environment looks like. But the second biggest determinant is probably governance, good governance or a certain kind of governance makes a huge difference in our lives.","Think of everything in Seattle - Microsoft, Amazon, Starbucks. Then you go down to Silicon Valley - Intel, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter. What does New York produce?","Brunch is boring, but that's part of the charm of it.","I don't get that much enjoyment out of saying 'I own it.'","I don't mind staying in one place for a while - I like to spend a lot of time in Los Angeles. It's a place where nobody goes out, where people will leave you alone. People in Los Angeles love themselves and they love what they do and they leave you alone. If you're isolated, you have a real advantage. You can work.","In my teens I was interested in photography. Then I decided that I should learn something about the world of commerce. And I came to America at age 17 to escape Europe. I went to NYU - nothing better than being 17 years old and coming to New York.","At the end, the key thing is you've got to live with yourself. That's the real test. Everything else is fleeting.","I felt I was owned by possessions.","Luckily the whole world is not like me, or else, there would be no world.","I don't have a house, and I don't have a lot of time for socializing, so every year I have a party for all of my friends.","I tend to end relationships, so she can find somebody better than me. Because I want to be fair to people. I cannot devote enough energy and time and devotion to her. I think that is fair, no?","Most countries in Africa have the capacity to be great agricultural producers, but they do only subsistence production. So a family will produce for themselves and nothing more. Why? Because of the systems: The markets are not there to go beyond.","Commodity exchanges have a lot of advantages. One, you are helping transparency. Two, they are not political. It's institutional building. It can survive any environment, in theory.","Possessing things is not that interesting. Living in a grand environment to show myself and others that I have wealth has zero appeal.","I can drive. Let's just say you don't want to be in the passenger seat.","Other people might have family - three kids or five houses. In my case, that doesn't exist. I'm going to give everything away. Everything has been transferred to charitable trusts. There is no question about that. The question is where, not if.","L.A. is very special to me, so far away from my world on the East Coast, Europe, Asia. It's a bit of an island for me - less intense, less busy; because of time difference and location, it has a calming effect. At least it used to be all that.","If you erased New York, I hate to say it, if you erased Frankfurt, even London, the world would not have changed.","California is a place of invention, a place of courage, a place of vision, a place of the future. People who made California what it is were willing to take risks, think outside convention and build.","California has something which not every place in the world has: It has what I would call a sunny side, and I don't mean just physically, but the sunny side is a future. California's worth saving, to put it bluntly.","I was living in Paris, which is a very beautiful, very wonderful place, but a tight place as a city, a tight place culturally. Its people are very brilliant, thoughtful, the place functions, but it's a historical place in some ways, like a big museum.","I wish I was a great writer or a great journalist or a great scientist or a great artist; I'm not.","If you have things and if you are a perfectionist, which I am, you have to really tend to them, and it takes energy away from other things.","This is a bit like big-game hunting. You look for companies of a certain size that deserve to be public.","I understand the human instinct to want to create a nest and possess things, to show them off, but for me personally, it became less and less interesting.","Everything I do now is about growing the pot to have more to give away."],"Nicolas Boileau-Despreaux":["However big the fool, there is always a bigger fool to admire him.","The dreadful burden of having nothing to do.","The world is full of fools; and he who would not wish to see one, must not only shut himself up alone, but must also break his looking-glass.","No one who cannot limit himself has ever been able to write."],"Nicolas Cage":["Every great story seems to begin with a snake.","I am not a demon. I am a lizard, a shark, a heat-seeking panther. I want to be Bob Denver on acid playing the accordion.","I think what makes people fascinating is conflict, it's drama, it's the human condition. Nobody wants to watch perfection.","The end of the world is on people's minds. We have the power to destroy or save ourselves, but the question is what do you do with that responsibility.","I use technology for communication, but I don't have a Blackberry or an iPhone. I use an outdated cell phone, but I'm fine with it.","Snakes are sometimes perceived as evil, but they are also perceived as medicine. If you look at an ambulance, there's the two snakes on the side of the ambulance. The caduceus, or the staff of Hermes, there's the two snakes going up it, which means that the venom can also be healing.","I was always shocked when I went to the doctor's office and they did my X-ray and didn't find that I had eight more ribs than I should have or that my blood was the color green.","Everything we do impacts someone else's life.","Sometimes people think I'm wearing a wig when I'm not wearing a wig, and then sometimes they think I'm not wearing a wig when I am wearing a wig.","I have dogs, and it's no secret that I find reptiles interesting, but the thing about reptiles is that they really just wanna be left alone, and I understand them. It's, 'Don't pick me up, stop holding me, don't look at me, just leave me alone.' I have to admit, sometimes I feel like that.","The best characters are the ones that somehow manage to be both attractive and repulsive at the same time. If you do that, you're at the center of the universe - if you can find characters who are more ambiguous and can raise more questions than answers.","I like both Blu-ray and DVD, but Blu-ray gives you more options.","To be a good actor you have to be something like a criminal, to be willing to break the rules to strive for something new.","One of the things that's interesting to me is I find things like caffeine and stunts actually relax me. When they're putting a bit of gel on my arm and lighting me on fire, or when I'm about to go into a high-speed car chase or rev a motorcycle up pretty fast, I find everything else around me slows down.","I think that 'Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance' was mentally taxing, if only because I had to go to a Christmas party shortly after I had wrapped photography in Romania at two in the morning as the Ghost Rider. The invitation had a Christmas ornament on it with Ghost Rider's face on it as a tree.","Picasso said, 'Art is a lie that tells the truth.' What if you just want to tell the truth and not lie about it?","Personally, my interests are ancient history and ancient civilizations. In my own life, I'd like to go to places like Easter Island.","When I was eight, I would look at the cover of the 'Ghost Rider' comic book in my little home in Long Beach, California, and I couldn't get my head around how something that scary could also be good. To me it was my first philosophical awakening - 'How is this possible, this duality?'","There's a fine line between the Method actor and the schizophrenic.","As a child, these colourful superheroes that could fly, or were horrifying like Ghost Rider and the Hulk, with this tremendous rage or these supernatural powers, provided an escape for me from my mundane existence, from my lack of friends or my inability to communicate well with people. They liberated me.","I'll speak for myself, but there's a lot of humor to be found in sarcasm and darkness. You talk to any paramedic, they survive by developing a pretty off-kilter sense of humor.","Look, I happen to still like really dark, dramatic, fractured characters.","I love all animals. I have a fascination with fish, birds, whales - sentient life - insects, reptiles.","Passion is very important to me. If you stop enjoying things, you've got to look at it, because it can lead to all kinds of depressing scenarios.","I think the paparazzi might have chased me out of Los Angeles.","I'm one of those people that feels that Americans that shouldn't do Shakespeare... The rhythms of the English language and the mannerisms of the English speech seems to work effortlessly with William Shakespeare, but when Americans do it, something seems stuck.","I bought a Yamaha-1 and I was doing 180 miles per hour home on the 405 and that's really, really crazy but I did it.","I don't want you to think that I'm up late reading a stack of Spider-Man comics and eating a tray of lemon cookies while sucking my thumb. I'm not doing that. But I am loyal to the influences of my childhood.","I would like to find a way to embrace what Led Zeppelin did, in filmmaking.","I always see America as really belonging to the Native Americans. Even though I'm American, I still feel like a visitor in my own country.","We do see Gong Li, Zhang Ziyi and Chow Yun Fat, but it's very rare to see the Chinese male actor in Hollywood movies, which is something I take great umbrage with. You know, my son is Asian. He may want to direct one day; he may want to be an actor like his father - and I want that to be open to him.","Zoology has always been interesting to me. Nature is fascinating.","My father once said, 'If you're in the desert and you're dying of thirst, are you going to drink a glass of blood or are you going to drink a glass of water?' I think what he was trying to say, interesting coming from my blood father, is sometimes there are people in your family that can be toxic.","I don't drink blood, and last time I looked in the mirror, I had a reflection.","Mel Blanc is a hero because of what he could do with his voice for all the Looney Tunes, the Warner Brothers cartoons, to be the voice of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Porky Pig.","I haven't isolated myself. I am not living on a yacht somewhere. I am not tucked away or behind a gate somewhere. I am not flying on a private plane. I am going to the airport, I am with people, some of the interactions are good, some of them are not so good, but it keeps me in touch with being, you know, part of society.","I came out of independent film, that's my roots.","I love England - it's no secret.","I want to always find new ways of reinventing myself.","Mel Blanc is a hero because of what he could do with his voice for all the Looney Tunes, the Warner Brothers cartoons, to be the voice of Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Porky Pig. To me, he's a great actor.","God bless my father, but he always spoke in this continental, literary accent, probably because he was a professor of comparative literature and he made the decision to speak with distinction.","Children, to me, are of the utmost importance. They're really the future, aren't they?","At a young age, I was interested in comic books, which was really how I learnt to read. The name Cage came from a comic book character called Power Man.","I have a love / hate relationship with the city of New Orleans, which is the strongest kind of relationship.","When I play supernatural characters in 'Ghost Rider' or 'City Of Angels,' the possibilities are limitless. The possibilities are endless, you can do so much with that.","I know what it's like to meet someone you admire and have them be a complete jerk.","I haven't made anything I don't believe in. I've always started a movie with a song in my heart, and even when I'm a little unclear about it, something magical happens and it comes into focus in a way that I'm feeling good about.","Film acting is one of the only industries where you're criticized for working hard. In any other industry, it's considered a quality and something to behold.","I'm not really gadget oriented. I'm not into technology or computers. I'm not good at interfacing with that sort of gear.","I've always maintained that I see myself as a student. There's always something to learn and be challenged by and hopefully grow from.","I believe that there's a way to question authority with manners, with dignity. There's no reason to be rude about it.","One of the pluses of getting older is you set some limits.","Good science fiction is intelligent. It asks big questions that are on people's minds. It's not impossible. It has some sort of root in the abstract.","Often you hear stories about never working with children. I disagree because children still have that residual magical thinking. They haven't had their imagination knocked out of them by turning into adults and life experiences.","My father was always getting excited about something. It's genetically inside me somewhere.","When you start a movie, it's not like other kinds of work that you have when you know your boss for years or colleagues for years. You're meeting everyone, mostly, for the first time. You have to get comfortable with those people so you can perform, because the first thing that is going to shut you down is any kind of anxiety.","I loved 'Fantasia' as a kid because it filled me with wonder, enchantment and awe. It was my first real introduction into classical music. It was totally inspiring to me.","Shock is still fun. I won't ever shut the door on it.","It's a family that's loaded with grudges and passion. We come from a long line of robbers and highwaymen in Italy, you know. Killers, even.","As a teenager I was more of an anarchist, but now I want people to thrive and be harmonious.","I think I jump around more when I'm alone.","I try to do as many stunts as they'll let me do. I think it's important for an audience to feel that the actor's really doing it.","Hollywood didn't know if I was an actor or a nut or if I was this crazy character I was playing. I had developed an image of being a little bit unusual, different and wild.","I wanted to make an image for myself as an outlaw type. A kind of rock 'n' roll sensibility.","I want to make all kinds of movies. I do want to make big movies that are a lot of fun to go to, but I also want to make movies that are going to stimulate some thought and maybe raise some awareness.","I'm at the point now where I know I'm doing something right when a movie gets mixed reviews, because then I'm not in the box. I don't want to make it too easy for people and I don't want to make it too easy for myself. I want to try something unusual.","I do like to move and get physical in my movies.","I'm an enormous admirer of Christopher Lee. He's somebody, along with Vincent Price, who I celebrate, and I wanted my movies to show that celebration and that honoring of these great film stars that were unafraid to go into horror and Grand Guignol and the macabre.","I would definitely return to Austria. They were all good experiences for me, but definitely Austria because there were some ancient Celtic, sacred sites that were in the forest that were quite beautiful.","I have eclectic tastes in the movies I want to do.","I don't want to just do independent movies and I don't want to just do adventure films. I enjoy both, and I think both are cogent.","I'm the first to admit that I like going to, or my memories at least of going to Clint Eastwood movies or Charles Bronson or James Bond.","And what I like about it is it makes me happy and I think it makes a lot of people happy to go to the movies and to not think about the problems of the day or the problems of tomorrow or the yesterday and just go on for the ride and have the fun of losing oneself in a fantasy.","How do you rebel in a family of rebels?","If I could have been a marine biologist I would have, but I didn't have that kind of intelligence. Numbers were never my strong point.","I hit the ground running, without a lot of training, so I had to do whatever I could do to survive as a professional, and if that meant being that character 24/7 and acting out, I was going to do that. I lived those characters, I brought them home with me.","As I got older, with my work, I became aware of the responsibility of film, and I feel one of the best ways I can apply myself as an actor, is to go beyond movie stardom and celebrity.","My mother was a dancer, so I like to use the body as part of the instrument of acting.","I may be alone in this, but I do sense the power of film, in that movies have the ability to literally change people's minds. That's pretty powerful stuff when you consider that.","I like fantasy. I like horror, science fiction because I can get avant-garde with those performances in those movies.","All of my characters have a glint of madness.","I've always had a soft spot for comic books.","Having been a father for 19 years I realise fatherhood has changed me.","I'm sticking my tongue out in scenes to try to make that work in 3D. I'm thinking I'll try to get my tongue all the way out to the second row of the audience.","For me, acting was a way of taking destructive energy and doing something productive with it, and in that way it was quite a life saver.","I mean, I've acted professionally since I was 16.","The biggest problem for me was feeling that as I became more balanced and a better man that I wouldn't have the fire to create from.","It's amazing marrying someone who wants nothing to do with Hollywood.","Actors have an opportunity to use storytelling as a way to solve pain.","I care about the connection with the audience. Film is such a powerful medium. Movies can change the way people think.","Disney has a great tradition of enchanting children and giving them something to behold.","I don't want a perfect character, I want a character who has, as strange as it sounds, some humanity, some flaws, some needs.","I do enjoy animated movies.","The fact that 'Astro Boy' appealed to me as a boy in America was proof that the story and character transcend cultural stereotypes.","I know there's been a lot that's been said about animated voice work, as though it's 'you can do this in your jeans and there's no camera and no pressure there. It's no big deal. It's easy.' The truth is, it's really a great test: how deep is your ability is to access your imagination?","There is a misperception, if you will, in critical response or even in Hollywood, that I can only do exaggerated characters. Or what they would call over-the-top performances. Well, this is completely false.","I never studied dance, but if you look at 'Wild At Heart,' my mother saw that movie and said, 'You are a dancer. Look at how you're moving: all that strange energy is like modern dance.'","I invite the entire spectrum, shall we call it, of feeling. Because that is my greatest resource as a film actor. I need to be able to feel everything, which is why I refuse to go on any kind of medication. Not that I need to! But my point is, I wouldn't even explore that, because it would get in the way of my instrument.","Celebrity is a word I take great umbrage with. I'm actively anti-celebrity.","I think it's no secret that I've tried to take chances in my career and also in my life, and I believe to not live in fear.","One of my goals is to have a base near mainland China. I think Hong Kong would be a good match for me. I like being in Hong Kong.","When I act, I hear it like music. In my head, I hear the dialogue like music.","You can't make your choices based on what critics think. You have to make your choices based on what's honest for you.","People are losing jobs, people need to be entertained, and I want to make movies that parents and children can look forward to seeing, that can become a kind of family ritual.","I happen to still like really dark, dramatic, fractured characters. They're the reason I got into movies.","How do you rebel in a family of rebels? That's the age-old question. I guess I could have by not going into the arts, but the thing is, I couldn't do anything else.","I've acted professionally since I was 16.","Nobody wants to watch perfection.","'Knowing' is one of those movies where you're going to get the spectacle, and you're going to have the entertainment in the grand science fiction tradition. But also, it will perhaps stimulate some discussion to help you sort out on your own where you might choose to go in terms of your own needs. Now, I say that without preaching.","How do you say one actor is better than another actor? You can definitely say that in the Olympics if it's the same race and someone wins the race. The only way to really do it and have it be sincere would be if you get all the actors together, and they're all playing the same part, and then you rate which one made you feel the most.","I've always had a soft spot for comic books. I learned to read from them. The words in them were so interesting.","I'm not an anarchist any more. I still love the Sex Pistols, but I don't want to be a punk rocker all the time, but I do want to carry on exploring new forms of acting.","I don't think movies are the reason why this violence exists, I think it's going to happen whether movies are there or not.","Most of my favourite moments in film have been when I've had an opportunity to say something from scratch, something original, whether I jotted down a few lines or it came out in improvisation.","Guy Pearce is very precise and clear about understanding the rhythm and the music of a scene.","Acting is always at the core of my life, but I'm also excited about producing. I'm excited about directing, and I have a life in the filmmaking world, and so I want to explore all aspects of it, not just the acting, but acting is the root.","I think that if you go about making movies to win Oscars, you're really going about it the wrong way.","It may come as a surprise to people, but I'm actually quite boring and normal. What do I do? I read books. I drive my kid to school. I have lunch with my wife. I pick my kid up from school. I go home.","When I'm in England, I know I'm a visitor, but being a white man in England with ancestry that's German and Italian, I have a history with the Romans and the Saxons. I feel some connection and ancestry here, as weird as that sounds.","I'm not afraid to play ugly - look at 'Adaptation.' I looked like a turd that a cat had coughed up.","There were two movies that asked me to go to Australia or New Zealand for long periods of time. One was 'Lord of the Rings' and one was 'The Matrix.' But I was actively involved at that time raising my family, and I couldn't really take that time out.","Hopefully as a result of 'The Frozen Ground,' more and more people will be aware of the horrible things that happen to ladies all over the world and give them respect. This movie is a love letter to those victims.","I'm very impressed with 'Drive.'","Science fiction is a way that I can go into the abstract, go into the imagination, and audiences are still willing to go along for the ride.","I'm always curious about what happens when we die. And I'd like to think that somehow the spirit goes on. I'd rather not think that it's just about this.","I try to make two movies a year. To me, that's not too much. On top of that, I like to work.","I don't want to sit around by the pool luxuriating with a margarita. That's just not what I want to do.","I would like to hook up with one of the great Japanese filmmakers, like the master that made 'Ringu,' and I would like to take 'The Wicker Man' to Japan, except this time he's a ghost.","The only reason why I tend to pass on a movie is either I don't think I'm right for the material and can't play it honestly, or because of time constraints with personal things in my life.","I do tend to apply myself to projects that make me uncomfortable because usually when that happens I try to find a way of existing in the project that is more creative.","It's no secret that I've always had an interest in mythology. Whether it's Arthurian or ancient Greek or even Marvel universe. I've always connected with it on some level.","One day, one of my dreams is to someday get to do Nemo in '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.'","Idris Elba is a grand actor. He's very larger than life; he's bigger than life.","I've really had good luck working with younger actors. Every younger actor that I have worked with has always been really on top of their game and fascinating to watch.","Actors, their greatest tool, their greatest resource is imagination. You can take things, power objects, you can recruit your dreams, you can access your memories and get there. So the idea is not to act but to just be.","Someone like Vincent Price or somebody like Christopher Lee, they never won an award, and it doesn't matter. They're cool.","You can choose your family sometimes. You can choose people, it could be a teacher, it could be a professor, it could be someone you work with that actually genuinely cares about you and wants you to succeed.","I think I've spent more time in front of a camera than off camera. That's just the way it is.","My house is basically a trailer. I live a circus lifestyle. I'm always moving. It's not always easy for people that live with me, but that's the path I chose.","Just because you're a man doesn't mean that you can't raise your kid. I think that families should stay together, but if you are a single father, don't give up no matter what they say.","I always say to myself that if I can make a movie that makes a kid smile or gives them some hope or something to get excited about, then I'm applying myself in the best way that I can. I don't think that just goes for kids. I think that it goes for adults, as well, and for families.","I knew I wanted to be an actor when I was very young. I guess I was about 6 years old at the time, and I was fascinated by television. I started having waking fantasies where I was in a movie and there were crane shots of me during a scene.","I've always had an interest in Louisiana, especially New Orleans.","I would love to work with Tim Burton. I think we would be very good together.","Acting is like any other art form, in that you have the option to go very big or go very small.","You get dinged for wanting to do a comedy, then wanting to do a big-budget action film, and then wanting to do an indie. But you can't let other people trying to label you get in the way of trying to do something artistically.","I definitely went through my magic phase. I think all little boys do at some point or another - they get fascinated by magic tricks.","I'm not a trained actor. I'm someone who is autodidactic and learned on my own.","When I won the Oscar, I made a point of actively going against that and doing adventure films like 'Con Air' and 'Gone in 60 Seconds,' not what would be expected.","I do enjoy animated movies. I really love anime and movies like 'Spirited Away' and 'Howl's Moving Castle.'","I like movies where you feel like you're going into another world, and no matter how many times you watch it, you're gonna see something new in that world. That level of detail really inspires me.","In this day and age, where you have a lot of comic book movies made every day, and most of them are really good boys, it's important to have a couple bad boys out there, too.","Mike Myers as Austin Powers makes me laugh - that was genius - and Daffy Duck makes me laugh, but I like odd behavior. I don't like hip dialogue and one-liners and all that sort of cool, sophomoric comedy. It's just not for me.","I'm not contractually obligated to sequels on anything.","If I do do a sequel, I'm going to have to know for sure that the script is better than the original. So I'm going to be very careful about that because I'm not eager to repeat myself.","Film has lost something in the translation to high tech. It's become so super-real. It's with digital this and stereo that, and everything's like a CD.","The movies I cannot go without and that I watch annually are 'A Clockwork Orange,' 'Scarface' and 'Fantasia.'","Helen Mirren is someone that I have really admired ever since I saw her in 'Excalibur.' That was the first thing I said to her. 'I loved you as Morgan Le Fay.'","I try not to be proud. I try to actively attack pride.","I've gotten pretty good at leaving characters on the set. I go home and try to relax and regroup and be ready for the next day.","I want people to discover my movies, and however they choose to receive it is their business."],"Nicolas Chamfort":["The only thing that stops God from sending another flood is that the first one was useless.","The most wasted day of all is that on which we have not laughed.","Contemplation often makes life miserable. We should act more, think less, and stop watching ourselves live.","Swallow a toad in the morning and you will encounter nothing more disgusting the rest of the day.","There are two things that one must get used to or one will find life unendurable: the damages of time and injustices of men.","Love is more pleasant than marriage for the same reason that novels are more amusing than history.","All passions exaggerate; and they are passions only because they do exaggerate.","Nature never said to me: Do not be poor; still less did she say: Be rich; her cry to me was always: Be independent.","Conviction is the conscience of the mind.","Man arrives as a novice at each age of his life.","Real worth requires no interpreter: its everyday deeds form its emblem.","The art of the parenthesis is one of the greatest secrets of eloquence in Society.","I have three kinds of friends: those who love me, those who pay no attention to me, and those who detest me.","There are well-dressed foolish ideas just as there are well-dressed fools.","The person is always happy who is in the presence of something they cannot know in full. A person as advanced far in the study of morals who has mastered the difference between pride and vanity.","Some things are easier to legalize than to legitimate.","There are certain times when public opinion is the worst of all opinions.","One must not hope to be more than one can be.","Celebrity is the advantage of being known to people who we don't know, and who don't know us.","Whatever evil a man may think of women, there is no woman but thinks more.","Preoccupation with money is the great test of small natures, but only a small test of great ones.","It must be admitted that there are some parts of the soul which we must entirely paralyse before we can live happily in this world.","The contemplative life is often miserable. One must act more, think less, and not watch oneself live.","There is a melancholy that stems from greatness.","People are governed with the head; kindness of heart is little use in chess.","There are more people who wish to be loved than there are who are willing to love.","Most books today seemed to have been written overnight from books read the day before.","Change of fashion is the tax levied by the industry of the poor on the vanity of the rich.","Living is a sickness to which sleep provides relief every sixteen hours. It's a palliative. The remedy is death.","When a man and a woman have an overwhelming passion for each other, it seems to me, in spite of such obstacles dividing them as parents or husband, that they belong to each other in the name of Nature, and are lovers by Divine right, in spite of human convention or the laws.","If it were not for the government, we should have nothing to laugh at in France.","Do you think that revolutions are made with rose water?","Man may aspire to virtue, but he cannot reasonably aspire to truth.","Scandal is an importunate wasp, against which we must make no movement unless we are quite sure that we can kill it; otherwise it will return to the attack more furious than ever.","It is commonly supposed that the art of pleasing is a wonderful aid in the pursuit of fortune; but the art of being bored is infinitely more successful.","Most of those who make collections of verse or epigram are like men eating cherries or oysters: they choose out the best at first, and end by eating all.","Society is composed of two great classes those who have more dinners than appetite, and those who have more appetite than dinners.","Philosophy, like medicine, has plenty of drugs, few good remedies, and hardly any specific cures."],"Nicolas Ghesquiere":["Never forget that what becomes timeless was once truly new.","People used to define me as a futurist designer, but, you know, the future is now for me.","I grew up in a family that played golf, and my brother was much better than me, so I kind of put that aside. I had to be good at something other than golf.","Actually, I love golf clothes! I think this is the most interesting part of golf!","With my designs and my ideas, I want to please myself first.","I'm always very stressed about making a new proposition every season. But in a way, it's a kind of addiction.","I promised myself: Before your 18th birthday, you're going to be at Jean Paul Gaultier. And it worked. I was hired.","What I find most interesting in fashion is that it has to reflect our time. You have to witness your own moment.","In this work, you have to convince everyone all the time, at different levels, to support your dream. I learned you have to be confident in order to do that.","In terms of design, it's true the world has an influence. But, as a designer, you have to protect yourself. You have to look at the world and then forget it.","Of course I live in my time, and I'm really curious. But, at the same time, I don't think it has a direct impact on my work.","Your priority has to be the creativity - and build a brand. That's what everybody did - Balenciaga, Dior, Saint Laurent. That's the smart thing to do.","I think the golden age of couture had some of the most incredible customers: women like Nan Kempner and all the icons.","There are people I've worked with who have never understood how fashion works. They keep saying they love fashion, yet they've never actually grasped that this isn't yoghurt or a piece of furniture - products in the purest sense of the term."],"Nicolas Maduro":["We are all a little bit hippy, a little bohemian. We take that from the culture we knew, from the '70s and the '80s.","I can tell you that I never aspired to be president. I always honour something that Commander Chavez told us: that while we were in these posts, we must be clothed in humility and understand that we are here to protect the man and woman of the streets.","My message to France and Europe is that we will make sure Venezuela won't witness the rise of another Pinochet. And we will do it the democratic way.","Venezuelans have a long history. So we are able to listen to each other, to talk to each other. From here were born the liberators of the region, and they said before and after that process we have a culture of political action. We are not in despair. That's the image broadcast to abroad.","Let's dig deep to build the kind of police force that our fatherland really deserves. We need a revolution of the police force here in Venezuela, and I will carry it out without delay, without excuses.","The Venezuelan people will never abandon the ideals President Chavez gave us. Modestly, we contribute to ensure the stability of the region.","The United States are ruled by a financial, media-centered, military-industrial apparatus. Behind Obama's grin, he orders bombings. He just displays a different image than Bush. That's how he expands U.S. global domination.","I have very good relations with Pope Francis. I read constantly what he says and follow his speeches. Pope Francis has come to renew the Catholic Church, and he has new air to renew the spiritual world. Now, Venezuela does not need mediation.","Fidel Castro represents the dignity of the South American continent against empires. He's a living legend: an icon of independence and freedom across the continent.","I am just a humble worker. Commander Chavez decided I should be president. To President Obama, we remember that young leader and of the workers of Chicago. So we have a different kind of relation. For him and John Kerry. We talked to Edward Kennedy.","President Chavez has always been a loyal friend of Gaddafi, assassinated in the crudest way possible. Europe should think about the bombings and the destruction of Libya that filled the country with terrorists. Who's truly ruling Libya's military and sending thousands of armed men to fight in Syria? It's Al Qaeda.","Similar questions were posed to Allende as to me. Allende was told that he blamed everything on a conspiracy, on the economic crisis, that he blamed the high inflation that sabotaged him on the United States, and that he was frequently accusing the little lambs of Nixon and Kissinger of a coup. But everything became known later."],"Nicolas Malebranche":["I love good and pleasure, I hate evil and pain, I want to be happy and I am not mistaken in believing, that people, angels and even demons have those same inclinations.","We see things in this material world, wherein our bodies dwell, only because our mind through its attention lives in another world, only because it contemplates the beauties of the archetypal and intelligible world which Reason contains.","As our bodies live upon the earth and find sustenance in the fruits which it produces, so our minds feed on the same truths as the intelligible and immutable substance of the divine Word contains.","Just as our eyes need light in order to see, our minds need ideas in order to conceive.","All creatures are united to God alone in an immediate union. They depend essentially and directly upon Him. Being all alike equally impotent, they cannot be in reciprocal dependence upon one another.","God joins us together by means of the body, in consequence of the laws of the communication of movements. He affects us with the same feelings in consequence of the laws of the conjunction of body and soul.","Do not fear lest you should meditate too much upon Him and speak of Him in an unworthy way, providing you are led by faith. Do not fear lest you should entertain false opinions of Him so long as they are in conformity with the notion of the infinitely perfect Being.","Prejudices are not easily got rid of as an old coat which is no longer thought of.","God transforms, so to speak, this air into words, into various sounds. He makes you understand these various sounds through the modifications by which you are affected.","He has willed - He wills incessantly - that the modifications of the mind and those of the body shall be reciprocal. This is the conjunction and the natural dependence of the two parts of which we are constituted.","I beg of you always to dwell upon the necessity of a thorough understanding of principles, in order to stop the vivacity of his mind, and please do not forget to meditate upon the subject of our discussion.","In this connection, faith and experience teach us many truths by means of the short-cut of authority and by the proofs of very pleasant and agreeable feelings.","Our soul is not united to our body in the ordinary sense of these terms. It is immediately and directly united to God alone.","We are made to know and love God.","You cannot of yourself move your arm or alter your position, situation, posture, do to other men good or evil, or effect the least change in the world.","You find yourself in the world, without any power, immovable as a rock, stupid, so to speak, as a log of wood.","You will not dishonor the divine perfections by judgments unworthy of them, provided you never judge of Him by yourself, provided you do not ascribe to the Creator the imperfections and limitations of created beings."],"Nicolas Roeg":["Mirrors are the essence of movies.","Our lives are full of all the genres. Fear and hope and sadness.","You make the movie through the cinematography - it sounds quite a simple idea, but it was like a huge revelation to me.","And later I thought, I can't think how anyone can become a director without learning the craft of cinematography.","You cannot intellectualize yourself out of obsession. You cannot cure yourself of it.","I came up the old-fashioned way - tea boy, cutter, focus-puller, cinematographer - but I wasn't myself old-fashioned.","I've used mirrors in a lot of movies. I think the mirror is an extraordinary thing, also the reflective, a reflection in water, etc.","'Eureka' was very bad timing. The early 1980s: Reagan and Thatcher were in, greed was good, and here was a film about the richest man in the world who still couldn't be happy. Politically and sociologically, it was out of step.","Marketing is a very good thing, but it shouldn't control everything. It should be the tool, not that which dictates.","Movies are not scripts - movies are films; they're not books, they're not the theatre.","Any change in form produces a fear of change, and that has accelerated. Marketing is the death of invention, because marketing deals with the familiar.","But in marketing, the familiar is everything, and that is controlled by the studio. That is reaching its apogee now.","Children's finger-painting came under the arts, but movies didn't.","Fear has many faces.","I was very glad later when I was directing that I wasn't in the hands of a cinematographer and hoping that he would do it well. I would know what he was doing, and we could discuss how that scene would look.","In life, we all learn from everyone.","Some people are very lucky, and have the story in their heads. I've never storyboarded anything. I like the idea of chance. What makes God laugh is people who make plans.","The great difference between screen acting and theatre acting is that screen acting is about reacting - 75% of the time, great screen actors are great reactors.","The rules are learnt in order to be broken, but if you don't know them, then something is missing.","There was a village watercolour society and they'd come and paint in my field. I watched them from the window, the way they would struggle this way and that to find the perfect moment. God has made every angle on that beautiful, and I felt that tremendously.","They think something's gone wrong, but in Don't Look Now, for instance, one scene was made by a mistake. It's the scene where Donald Sutherland goes to look for the policeman who's investigating the two women.","Years ago I had a house in Sussex, it was like Arcadia, with an old Victorian bridge, a pond and the Downs.","I imagine if aliens came down to Earth, they'd actually be quite tall; people seem to get everything right about extraterrestrials but the size!","I've always admired the tradition of storytellers who sat in the public market and told their stories to gathered crowds. They'd start with a single premise and talk for hours - the notion of one story, ever-changing but never-ending.","There's no one 'right' way of making a science fiction movie; there's no one way of making any kind of movie, really!","Oh, some of my films have been attacked with absolute vitriol!","I was always a bit arty-farty as a boy. 'Come on, Mr. Arty-Farty,' my sister used to say to me.","Film remains completely mystical and mysterious to me.","When a book is just a plot, you know, two men fight for the love of a woman in a wild frontier, I immediately ask, 'Why?'","Marketing is such a key issue; in fact, the marketing department is often involved in the approval of scripts now.","A lot of my movies have come to be thought about only years after the fact, and I'm sad about that but also happy about it in a way, as it's given them longevity.","People are mistaken to view cinema as some sort of gimmick. It's very much ingrained in the ways in which we understand each other.","When I look around, I begin to understand what Socrates meant when he said, 'How much there is in the world I do not want.'","My father was an extraordinary man.","When my sister and I were very young, my father used to tell us fairy stories that he'd made up. My mother was always telling him that he should write them down, but he would say, 'Well, they've all been done before. There are so many blooming books in the world - why should I write another one?'","I don't look back on any film I've done with fondness or pride.","I've never tried to enhance my reputation. Never moved upwards from one thing to another. That sort of thing is of no interest to me at all.","We all have our beliefs or our agnosticism.","I wouldn't like to be a non-believer in anything.","We're all influenced by everything unless we're locked in an empty room.","Youth is so exciting. It'll take over. I don't want to be swept away. I want to be with the taking-over people, right to the end.","How can you judge one film against another?","There's horror in your life, believe me, whether it's coming, or you've just been lucky to miss it today.","I've been told my movies are difficult to market.","I've always noticed that films set in any sort of future very rarely draw on the present.","I've always felt that, although Truffaut was greatly revered and admired, at the same time, in terms of film and how much he loved film, he was underestimated.","Critics reach that age when it is as valuable and daring to hold a negative opinion as it is for a positive. We learn and understand from both.","I like getting up early, but I haven't got a routine - mainly because I never have a clear idea of what day of the week it is.","I generally try to avoid talking about my old films - I find it difficult.","Too many films today feel formulaic and familiar. I prefer it when the familiar is made to feel strange.","I've always loved the future. But I must say the future changes a lot quicker than it used to. An era used to last thirty or forty years - now we're lucky if it's five.","I realized I've spent all my life creating a past.","Film can be more of a reality than a page with words can ever be.","Don't you think it's something strange that you rarely look at yourself in the mirror, except to do things like stand and ponder? I mean, in Shakespeare's day, it was thought that the mirror would reveal something, that it is trying to tell you something - not just to tidy your hair, but something more.","I've always thought there was something very marvelous and magical about mirrors, and that they are connected to memory as well.","'Puffball' is a love story... no, it's a life story.","Men and women's needs and desires overlap but go in different directions as well.","Grief is an emotion that's almost unplayable because you're in a separate emotional state; it's an inconsolable emotion.","I hate it when people talk about Tony Curtis and say: 'His real name was Bernie Schwartz... ' That was just the name that he was given at birth. It's not the person he lived his life with, and became.","Tony Curtis was a joy to work with. He had a curious innocence that is very young and wise at the same time.","I think the big studios shaped and formed the artists that they put under contract.","Our memory and the movies keep movie stars alive for us, and Tony Curtis is still a star.","Nature repeats itself, but it never starts from the beginning.","We can't get our youth back.","You can't hide in life. We are all being watched by some larger vision.","I like women in film. I like women in general, but I especially like to show them on film. They are not ciphers.","When I went to the cinema as a boy, when I saw a war film, I thought the general was the star, and that Cary Grant was an extra. I had no idea about the structure of film, but I loved going to the cinema.","Oscars are won with two or three shots only, because if it's really beautifully photographed, you don't really notice it until the astounding moment emphasizes it.","I made a film called 'Bad Timing' that I thought everybody would respond to. It was about obsessive love and physical obsession. I thought this must touch everyone, from university dons down.","When you admire someone's work, you are amazed by who you think they are.","I think I've never really liked the idea of genre, a film that follows the rules of a genre.","I like the probability of the impossible.","I love that perhaps we don't see the things that are there because we have no yardstick to see things by, to compare them.","Any cuts that are done to any film, they're usually things that have some personal resonance for whoever has got permission to cut it and feels they should. But it has very little to do with the actual weight, the truth, of the piece."],"Nicolas Sarkozy":["I love life too much to be bitter.","In a presidential campaign, you can't lie. You can't hide what you are and what you want. You can't hide what kind of President you'll be. You can't keep on talking about nothing indefinitely and committing to nothing, you can't keep running away from debate, masking the challenges.","You won't hear from me again.","You are the eternal France, I love you.","Francois Hollande is an intelligent man. I do not have a problem with him. The only thing is, he has never held office at the state level. Honestly, can you imagine Francois Hollande as president of France? Imagine it!","I want to wage war against illiteracy, poverty, unemployment, unfair competition, communitarianism, delinquency.","I fought for the values of responsibility, and I'm not a man who does not accept his responsibilities.","I'm ready to become a French person amongst French people, and more than ever I have the love for my country deeply ingrained in my heart.","Francois Hollande is the president of the republic, he must be respected. I want to wish him good luck in the midst of these tests.","I committed myself totally, fully, but I didn't succeed in convincing a majority of French... I didn't succeed in making the values we share win.","A page is turning for me. I won't be candidate in legislative elections, nor in any elections to come.","France now has a new president and he must be respected. I assume full responsibility for this defeat.","I am not a man of my party. I do not talk only to socialists and union leaders.","I don't give any gifts to the rich.","Perhaps the mistake I made at the start of my mandate is not understanding the symbolic dimension of the president's role and not being solemn enough in my acts. A mistake for which I would like to apologise or explain myself and which I will not make again. Now, I know the job.","France is the country with the highest taxes in Europe along with Sweden... something of which I am not proud.","I hope that France - and all of Europe - we would take an initiative for the year 2012 to be the year of peace between Israel and the Palestinians.","It's disrespectful to tell the French in the morning that you're going to reduce the debt, in the evening that you're not going to make any savings, and the next morning, after thinking about it, that you're going to spend more.","The French people need to have all the facts so they can choose. And I won't be running away from it or hiding from it."],"Nicolaus Copernicus":["To know that we know what we know, and to know that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.","Of all things visible, the highest is the heaven of the fixed stars.","Finally we shall place the Sun himself at the center of the Universe.","Those things which I am saying now may be obscure, yet they will be made clearer in their proper place.","For I am not so enamoured of my own opinions that I disregard what others may think of them.","At rest, however, in the middle of everything is the sun.","First of all, we must note that the universe is spherical.","I am aware that a philosopher's ideas are not subject to the judgment of ordinary persons, because it is his endeavour to seek the truth in all things, to the extent permitted to human reason by God.","The massive bulk of the earth does indeed shrink to insignificance in comparison with the size of the heavens.","For it is the duty of an astronomer to compose the history of the celestial motions through careful and expert study.","Mathematics is written for mathematicians.","So far as hypotheses are concerned, let no one expect anything certain from astronomy, which cannot furnish it, lest he accept as the truth ideas conceived for another purpose, and depart from this study a greater fool than when he entered it.","Although all the good arts serve to draw man's mind away from vices and lead it toward better things, this function can be more fully performed by this art, which also provides extraordinary intellectual pleasure.","Therefore, having obtained the opportunity from these sources, I too began to consider the mobility of the earth.","Moreover, since the sun remains stationary, whatever appears as a motion of the sun is really due rather to the motion of the earth.","The earth also is spherical, since it presses upon its center from every direction.","I can easily conceive, most Holy Father, that as soon as some people learn that in this book which I have written concerning the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, I ascribe certain motions to the Earth, they will cry out at once that I and my theory should be rejected.","Those who know that the consensus of many centuries has sanctioned the conception that the earth remains at rest in the middle of the heavens as its center, would, I reflected, regard it as an insane pronouncement if I made the opposite assertion that the earth moves.","Near the sun is the center of the universe.","The earth together with its surrounding waters must in fact have such a shape as its shadow reveals, for it eclipses the moon with the arc of a perfect circle.","Therefore I would not have it unknown to Your Holiness, the the only thing which induced me to look for another way of reckoning the movements of the heavenly bodies was that I knew that mathematicians by no means agree in their investigation thereof.","Pouring forth its seas everywhere, then, the ocean envelops the earth and fills its deeper chasms.","I shall now recall to mind that the motion of the heavenly bodies is circular, since the motion appropriate to a sphere is rotation in a circle.","For a traveler going from any place toward the north, that pole of the daily rotation gradually climbs higher, while the opposite pole drops down an equal amount.","Not a few other very eminent and scholarly men made the same request, urging that I should no longer through fear refuse to give out my work for the common benefit of students of Mathematics.","So, influenced by these advisors and this hope, I have at length allowed my friends to publish the work, as they had long besought me to do.","Therefore, when I considered this carefully, the contempt which I had to fear because of the novelty and apparent absurdity of my view, nearly induced me to abandon utterly the work I had begun.","Therefore, in the course of the work I have followed this plan: I describe in the first book all the positions of the orbits together with the movements which I ascribe to the Earth, in order that this book might contain, as it were, the general scheme of the universe.","In so many and such important ways, then, do the planets bear witness to the earth's mobility.","More stars in the north are seen not to set, while in the south certain stars are no longer seen to rise.","Yet if anyone believes that the earth rotates, surely he will hold that its motion is natural, not violent.","We regard it as a certainty that the earth, enclosed between poles, is bounded by a spherical surface.","Accordingly, since nothing prevents the earth from moving, I suggest that we should now consider also whether several motions suit it, so that it can be regarded as one of the planets. For, it is not the center of all the revolutions."],"Nicole Anderson":["I can't say that I've ever tried to hurt someone or humiliate them intentionally. My parents raised me to always be the bigger person or to treat others the way you want to be treated.","Never change the person that you are just to fit in. You'll find your true friends that like you for you, and if you are happy with doing things that you genuinely enjoy, it shouldn't matter what other people think.","I had a couple friends from all the different cliques in school, but my true friends were my gymnastics teammates. I grew up competing with them for ten years.","I have gone to Niagara-on-the-Lake. You know, Niagara Falls in Canada. It's this cute little quaint town, and it's just warm, and everyone is so nice.","I was home schooled in high school but was definitely the nerd in middle school.","I was in three academic clubs, a huge book worm and the teacher's pet. I was kind of an easy target for bullies.","I couldn't have gotten this far without my beautiful parents. I'm also very lucky to have the best friends that I do.","I was home schooled in high school but was definitely the nerd in middle school.

I've always dreamed of a beach wedding.","Giving birth was easier than having a tattoo.","I could see us doing solo material in the future.","It's my first presenting role so I'll be nervous, but it's going to be great fun. I can't wait to sample the food and meet the celebrities. Hopefully I can inject some of my own glamour.","For me being the youngest, there was never ever anything that was an issue to cause rivalry between me and my sisters.","It's really exciting and kind of special, especially having our own band. It's just completely different.","Being a mum has made me a lot more responsible, it's not just me anymore. But it's also brought me the most joy ever!","Nothing beats having this beautiful child look at me and say mum. I get soppy all the time.","I find intelligence sexy. I find a sense of humor sexy. I find sensitivity sexy.","We've going to bring back thighs. Enough of these size zeros. Thighs, and back fat, and over-the-belt fat, it's all got to come back again, and we're the ones to do it.","I wasn't born thin. I train. But I would never starve myself. I mean, what is happening with women these days? I just couldn't see myself looking that thin. I like a bit of waist and leg.","I'm in the public eye. I know I'm not going to be treated like a normal person walking down the street.","I went out with Robbie Williams and Liam Gallagher. I was accused of going out with many different people but that wasn't my fault.","I befriend people too quickly - I don't think that's wrong, but I get told that I should be a bit more careful.","My nickname is The Fonz. My sister Lori nicknamed me it when I was younger and it stuck.","I hate that word 'hate' - it should be banned.","Marriage is important to me and I love the idea of being married.","I never want to discourage anyone who chooses the arts as a path because it's hard enough to make it in this business or even get ahead."],"Nicole Ari Parker":["Raising children uses every bit of your being - your heart, your time, your patience, your foresight, your intuition to protect them, and you have to use all of this while trying to figure out how to discipline them.","Nobody can tell you how to be a good wife or husband.","We're all moving at such a high rate that we have to grab the frozen dinners and the McDonald's. We can't make it a way of life - we have to get back to real, simple, clean good foods. It will save our lives on so many levels; not just spina bifida, but obesity, diabetes, everything. Food is our medicine.","God loves you and everything about you, so why beat up on your precious self?","There are so many things that go into a surgical study.","A guy once told me that I sound like I'm a little ahead of myself. I can't wait to thank him at the Oscars.","All kids want from their dad is for them to be around - and to show up when they say they're going to show up.","My daughter has a vivid imagination, and so does my son.","If you had to work 14 hour days, Mondays to Fridays, then you have to keep Saturdays and Sundays sacred.","You shouldn't marry unless the both of you are on the same page on a lot of things. Life is going to deal you blows, and you have to be together. Your values and priorities have to be on the same page; otherwise, it won't work.","I have one little pooch-y stomach in a picture, and all of a sudden I'm pregnant.","Nobody really knows, but I got a little comedy in me.","Any actor will tell you that you go where the work is, especially when you have children.","Being a pedestrian again is very exciting because in L.A. you live in your car, and you're on a freeway all the time.","I couldn't imitate anyone if I wanted to.","If you're actually talking to someone who's been through a disastrous number of years, that only means one thing: They survived it.","Once there are more African Americans and Asian Americans behind the scenes as producers, writers, and directors, I think more inclusive casting will happen.","I have a real no-nonsense dad who taught me how to be resilient at a very young age.","It's not how pretty you are or how talented you are. It's that if these five people on this day in this room like you, then you get a job.","Spina bifida affects every single aspect of your life, from your child's self-esteem to your ability to sleep at night.","I have friends struggling with autism, juvenile diabetes.","Honestly, working with Eddie Murphy was mind-blowing just in terms of the budget alone. To see the respect he commands, to witness his presence, you understand why he and people like Martin Lawrence are stars.","I think 'Soul Food' had the biggest impact on me because that's where I was really able to shine as an actress and because I also met my husband there, and that was a huge turning point in my personal life. So, that show will stick with me forever and ever and ever.","Being away from home was tough, but the challenge and the thrill of being on Broadway was so fulfilling, and I'm thankful to my husband for making it possible and holding it down at home.","Being a parent is the hardest job ever in life.","You have to work hard not to take your partner for granted, even when you are tired.","I went to an all-girls private school, where we played field hockey and lacrosse.","When you set a play in the French Quarter in New Orleans, it's hard not to acknowledge the whole African-American, French, white mixing of races. That's what the French Quarter is: it's a Creole community.","Not just as a black woman, but as a woman, since the beginning of time, beauty has been our responsibility.","Exercise is about being grateful for the body you have and sustaining the life you have.","Take all the hype out of the exercise and think of it as brushing your teeth.","One good step breeds another one.","I'm really into nutrition from the inside out.","I enjoy using coconut oil - not only for my skin and hair, but I'll digest it.","Between the kids, the jobs and everything, no matter what color you are, cardio is probably not on the top of your list.","You think you need the newest shoe and the newest outfit. We forget exercising is free. We forget it only takes a little bit every day.","My humor is a lot like Kristen Wiig's from 'Saturday Night Live' or 'Bridesmaids.' Quirky, off the beaten path.","I can be really silly, but I never get to do that. I'm always playing on-the-nose characters, professionals - lawyers, a serious news anchor, people with a really focused energy, which can become a cliched type.","My husband and I are loyal to our community and very approachable, even though we're kind of mainstream.","I love Malcolm Lee and jumped on the opportunity to work with him as a director.","I believe that we have to be so race-conscious in this day and age.","I just want to touch something deep in the heart of humanity. I don't know if that's in movies, producing films, or writing a book, but I'm concerned about our spiritual well-being as a human race. I want to impact people in a way that makes us all reach for our best.","I love the theater. I love being on stage; I love the live audience. I also love dressing up and all of the make-believe.","Hair is an issue for most women, and after washing, blow-drying, flat-ironing, curling, braiding, twisting and spending the time and money on it, who wants to mess it up by sweating and having to do it all over again?","I had a brilliant drama teacher while I was at Roland Park: Ann Mainolfi. But the school was mostly rich in academics. It wasn't like I was prepping myself for a life in acting. There, you prepped yourself to have a stable future. The school's piece de resistance is college prep - it didn't teach you how to audition for a TV show.","I did everything pretty cliche as an actor in New York. I read the trades, I sent out 'head shots.'","I'm kind of floating out there as an artist. I'm in a safe place where I can play a girlfriend or a best friend or a mommy or a lawyer, but a huge part of me is unused. I'm classically trained, historically inclined and somewhat revolutionary by nature, so I'm frustrated as an artist.","Every parent knows this moment in a child's age when he or she needs your attention in a very specific way because it's the beginning and ending of the early life of imagination. It's such a responsibility."],"Nicole Avant":["I remember my dad supporting everyone on the local and national level. I was pretty much born into it. I saw the importance of politics firsthand. It gave you a chance to be at the table.","I'm out there talking to everyone. My days are filled with breakfast, lunches, dinner and drinks."],"Nicole Beharie":["I was kind of a bully, even though I'm tiny, 5' 2\". As a child, I'd boss other kids around and dress my little brother up, just putting on shows, singing and dressing up.","Everything about us black people is complicated, us being here, being a minority, being a woman, all those things are complicated.","There are expectations in how you play your character as a black woman, to be sassy and the same kind of feel, as if there are no quirky black women. I struggle with those things constantly, trying to add dimension to my work, and that's the goal, too.","When I was younger, my father was in the Foreign Service and we lived in Nigeria, Panama, and London, but for the most part I grew up in the South and D.C. I got the travel bug as a little person and I've bounced around a lot.","I went to Juilliard in New York and used to do cabarets just for fun. Occasionally, I would get together with a jazz musician and play at a restaurant for cash. And I've done some background vocals for recording artists.","My mom has an English accent, so we always referred to the trunk as the 'boot.' And then, suddenly, we moved to Georgia and I would say things like 'open the boot' with a bit of an accent, and I quickly realized I had to adapt; that kind of thing will get you beat up!","I was the jokester, the one who made the family laugh.","Stone Mountain, Georgia, still had Ku Klux Klan marches, and I had a wild and courageous mother who'd put us in the car to watch them. She wanted us to know those things existed.","I've been fortunate to work with Alfre Woodard and Jeffrey Wright; people who are artists, have careers, longevity and full lives. That looks good to me."],"Nicole Brown Simpson":["I'm afraid this man will kill me some day."],"Nicole Eggert":["For all the concern about bodies and weight, 'Baywatch' has three huge catering trucks on the set at all times. One for entrees, one appetizers and one for junk food.","When short guys start working out to bulk up. I like muscles, but I don't like really buff guys.","One guy wanted an outline of my foot. Another guy wanted locks of my hair.","Working out, for me, is sort of a meditation.","I love meeting 'the Odd Man Out' - like fans of 'Baywatch' who regret, as I do, that Tower 12 Productions didn't put nearly as much energy into writing and directing the show as they put into photographing and editing it.","I've heard The Demolitionist described, premise-wise, as 'RoboCop' meets 'The Crow' by way of 'La Femme Nikita'. That, as I see it, could not be more accurate.","The bathing suits they had me wear on Baywatch were all one-pieces, which kill my figure."],"Nicole Gale Anderson":["My best friends are just girls who go to school. They're not in the industry, and we have dinner nights and learn how to cook together and go on hiking trails and the beach.","New Orleans is kind of dark in a very beautiful way.","I was a huge bookworm, total nerd, so I was a victim in middle school. I was in three academic clubs, so I was an easy target.","I always think of young Hollywood as its own little high school. There are the girls who have been working for a while that are kind of like the Queen Bees and the new kids at 'school' just starting out."],"Nicole Holofcener":["Filming is a funny combination of having a good time and not being able to wait until it's over.","If a woman gets insomnia, you never know where you're going to find her furniture the next morning. It's primal. We have so little we can control, but we can perfect the way our room looks.","I always had good friends, but I did not feel like a cool girl, ever.","When I hear that a project takes place out of town, the material better be terrific, and it has to come at the right time. My kids are getting older, so it's getting easier, but being a mother - it's a difficult thing to juggle.","I'm sure it's more difficult for women to make movies, especially because, in general, the kind of movies women want to make aren't necessarily going to be blockbusters. But you know, there are so few women in so many positions of power.","It's harder to take care of kids than it is to make a movie.","To say you want to be a director is to risk sounding obnoxious, pretentious, arrogant, and I think women are more fearful of sounding that way than men are.","I hear people talk in my head, and I write it down. I choose where they live and how they dress to be real.","The stories that I want to tell are completely, well, somewhat autobiographical. It's completely based on my own self-absorption issues and problems.","I don't think of myself in a political way, though I am definitely a feminist.","I think I'm a good writer. I think I have my own voice, which is unique to everyone - everyone has their own voice; if they would just write from a vulnerable embarrassing place, it's going to be universal, and it's going to be entertaining. Because everyone is the same, and everyone is unique.","I'm a director, but I gotta have the hair, the makeup and the heels. My mother would be appalled if I didn't dress up.","My movies make a profit, but obviously not a fortune.","I would still encourage somebody, if they wanted to make a movie, to just go take a movie camera. That's clearly been shown to work.","I'm not a producer and I don't even know the places my producer goes to, thankfully.","I'm somebody's ex-wife, and I did things that drove him nuts. And now I'm somebody's girlfriend, for many years, and I've got different things that drive him nuts.","If the script is right, I'm not above doing a movie with broad appeal.","I'll write a character with a certain actor in mind, but then once I start casting, I have to forget about who I pictured.","I'm still shooting on low budgets, though none of my movies has lost money, and I rarely get sent anything that stars a guy or is a thriller or is seriously dramatic. And I would love the opportunity to do those things.","I definitely feel like a native New Yorker. My personality was formed there.","I have a stack of scripts that I've read - I'm in the lucky position where I get offered things - but I haven't wanted to direct many of them.","I'm being photographed, worrying about my hair - and yet here I am, I've directed a feature film, why do I care about the way I look? Who cares? Does Tim Burton care? Does Joel Coen?","Catherine Keener really gets me. She and I have such a shorthand together.","I'm willing to give up a little control but not a lot. So I say I want the money, but when push comes to shove, I'm not sure I'll be able to compromise in order to make the big studio movie. Maybe something in between would be okay, like a low-budget studio film.","I don't have a drawer full of ideas. I kind of look around and take notes and wonder what could actually be a whole movie. And each time, I think I'm going to do it more commercial this time; I'm going to get a big budget and make it. But I always come up with some small idea.","I rarely need career advice because I don't have a career. No, that's not true. I can't really go far away while my kids are living with me.","Hollywood is lacking realness in their female characters. I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that and wants to change it.","When I'm creating characters, I just want to create characters that I can relate to, and be as honest about them as people as I can be. That's what I want to see when I go to the movies.","If you keep the situations real, the characters' behavior will be real and honest, too. If they're suddenly robbing a bank and exchanging snappy dialogue, well, I wouldn't even know how to write that.","Hollywood always likes to create a star.","I went to NYU for a year and a half, and I graduated from there and then years later went to Columbia for graduate school.","I think that sometimes, romantic comedies have to be really broad, and that the plot of people falling in and out of love or whatever is not enough. 'Enough Said' had that stuff, but I wanted it to be fun and funny while also grounded in reality.","When I was going away to school, I had a friend who took a liking to my family just a little too much. We couldn't get her out of the house. It took me saying to my parents, 'I don't want her here. I'm feeling replaced.'","The fact that I get to write and direct my own personal story is an amazing thing.","I'm not crazy about having my picture taken. I'd rather talk my head off."],"Nicole Jordan":["I had never written anything before in my life except maybe in high school when I wrote a short story, and my mother had to put an ending on that.","I'd always been a big reader. I credit my mom for giving me my love of reading.","I've always loved horses. I had one horse when I was in high school, but I had to sell him because we moved to Germany, and it ripped my heart out, so I never wanted to go through that pain again. When we moved to Cincinnati and Louisville, Kentucky, I was able to ride then.","I've found that readers of historical romances really like series because they get to revisit characters and find out what happens with them. I've done several series."],"Nicole Kidman":["You don't have to be naked to be sexy.","I find standing and posing for photos very awkward.","LIfe has got all those twists and turns. You've got to hold on tight and off you go.","I would describe myself as emotional and highly strung. If something upsets me, it really upsets me. If something makes me angry, I get really angry. But it's all very upfront. I can't hide it. I'm also loyal and I hope I'm fun.","I always wanted to get married with just candles! I think candlelight is the most beautiful light there is and there's something very spiritual about it.","When you relinquish the desire to control your future, you can have more happiness.","I'm not sure what the future holds but I do know that I'm going to be positive and not wake up feeling desperate. As my dad said 'Nic, it is what it is, it's not what it should have been, not what it could have been, it is what it is.'","I love acting, but it's much more fun taking the kids to the zoo.","To be honest, I am completely natural. I have nothing in my face or anything. I wear sunscreen, and I don't smoke. I take care of myself and I'm very proud to say that.","I think that the most difficult thing is allowing yourself to be loved, so receiving the love and feeling like you deserve it is a pretty big struggle. I suppose that's what I've learnt recently, to allow myself to be loved.","I'm a person that carries everything that happened to me in my past, with me into the future. I refuse to let it make me bitter. I still completely believe in love and I remain open to anything that will happen to me.","I'll put it out there: I love getting hugs.","It's a very brave thing to fall in love. You have to be willing to trust somebody else with your whole being, and that's very difficult, really difficult and very brave.","If you're going to be with someone, you're with them, you're committed to them. I'm not sort of flitting around.","I'd like to be wise. You have to go through a lot to get there, but I'm willing to go through a lot.","That goes against what I believe morally. That's adultery, and if I'm accused of that, no, that's not right. I have two kids who see that and remember that and judge me. It didn't happen, and it's not to be reported that way.","I refuse to let what happened to me make me bitter.","I believe that as much as you take, you have to give back. It's important not to focus on yourself too much.","My life collapsed. People ran from me because suddenly it was 'Oh my God! It's over for her now!'","People can tell you what to do, but ultimately, we're all going to die, so how do you want to live?","Part of the reason of being an actor is you like playing other people's lives and exploring all the psychologies in that and the emotions.","You can ask me pretty much anything. There'll be things I'll go, 'That feels a little too personal.' But most things I don't have a fear of being asked about.","I don't really make decisions, I go with the flow.","I think each role takes a little from you and circles around you for the rest of your life. I don't think you ever abandon any of them.","I don't mind being naked.","What's the point of doing something good if nobody's watching.","I wouldn't want to be married to me, but luckily Tom Cruise does.","There's no drugs, no Tom in a dress, no psychiatrists.","I have a little bit of a belly, a tiny bit of pooch. It's the one thing I don't want to lose. I just like having some softness. If I lose that, then Tom might leave me.","You're not anyone in America unless you're on TV.","I'm a woman, a mother, a daughter, a sister. I'm a real person operating in the world. For me to discuss the most private thing feels wrong. It feels like I'm betraying myself and my children.","I just want to be nominated; beggars can't be choosers.","My choices in films are spontaneous.","They've said I'm gay, they've said everyone is gay. I personally don't believe in doing huge lawsuits about that stuff. Tom does. That's what he wants to do, that's what he's going to do. You do not tell Tom what to do. He is a force to be reckoned with.","I have a different approach. I don't file lawsuits because I really don't care.","Honestly, people have said everything under the sun. I just want to do my work, raise my kids, and hopefully find somebody who I can share my life with again.","You've just got to have a sense of respect for the person you have children with. Anger doesn't help anybody. Ultimately you have to say forgiveness is important, and honoring what you had together is important. But it's easy to say and harder to do.","I don't believe in having body doubles for a film.","I think at some stage, I would love to have another child. I would love to settle into a relationship that was really important to me. I actually am not good at the balance at that.","I think it's important that we don't all have to hold our heads high all the time saying everything's fine.","Salary stories are intrusive. Do you ask your neighbour what they earn for their job?","Even from a very early age, I knew I didn't want to miss out on anything life had to offer just because it might be considered dangerous.","I love working with people who are inspired and obsessive.","I never knew I'd be in a musical, let alone win an award for one.","Every day there is a compromise. Living with somebody requires a lot of understanding. But I love being married. I really love it.","I love acting but I don't like all of the other stuff associated with it. The interest in celebrities, the press, the Internet, when your identity becomes mixed up in the way people are preceving you.","I never read reviews at all. I'm proud of the work I did.","I'm trying to find a man to share my life with, but it's not been easy. I'm a 35-year-old woman with two small children.","Since I have fair skin, I have to stay out of the sun. I can't stand the sun. I dyed my hair red for a while during the 1990s but I'm actually a natural blonde.","Cinema is a director's medium, so you're saying, 'What do you want?' Being an actor is about adapting - physically and emotionally. If that means you have to look great for it and they can make you look great, then thank you. And if you have to have everything washed away, then I'm willing to do that too.","I think actors are getting so much more power these days, but I'm not. I stay very much away from the decisions, the way in which things are orchestrated, what's been changed. I just try to stay completely in the role as the actor and as the character.","It's so bizarre, I'm not scared of snakes or spiders. But I'm scared of butterflies. There is something eerie about them. Something weird!","It was very natural for me to want to disappear into dark theater, I am really very shy. That is something that people never seem to fully grasp because, when you are an actor, you are meant to be an exhibitionist.","Stay out of the sun, because it is the worst thing in terms of aging. I'm very medical. I come from a medical family.","I think I would be very sad if I wasn't able to have a baby.","I have a boy's body. I would prefer to have more curves because I think that's more beautiful. I would much rather have J. Lo's body than mine.","My parents thought it was nice to develop my imagination, but they never seriously thought that anything would ever come of it. They said that I couldn't be an actress because I would be taller than all my leading men, so I thought I would be a writer instead.","I never wore glasses except when I had to read a teleprompter at an awards show or drive, so I didn't notice much. I could exist in my head. It was kind of my escape from the world and my protection.","I was walking around legally blind. Now I have 20-20 vision. I can't believe I spent so many years blurry, but I think that coincides with how I was feeling. Now I notice if people are watching me, but I also smile right back if someone waves, which helps.","Yippee! I can't believe I made it. It feels like a long haul to get here. I'm so fine with it. People want you to have some sort of breakdown, but I'm relieved to be 40 years old, and I've lived a life.","The loss of a child is the most terrifying place for me to go.","If I were a strategically minded person, I think I would have a far different career.","I got married really fast and really young.","I want to be in places I've never been before.","I want to go home at night and feel discomfort.","I think having my life be as private and quiet as possible is a way in which then I can go and play characters.","I like the privacy of my life and I protect it quite vigilantly.","Not to be too detailed, but I've had an ectopic pregnancy, miscarriages and I've had fertility treatments. I've done all the stuff you can possibly do to try get pregnant.","It's very easy to fall in love when things are great, but the way to really fall in love is when things aren't great.","I think when you're in a relationship where you really care for the other person, when they achieve their dreams it's better than when you do yourself.","I would rather be tough on myself than have other people be tough on me.","I'm drawn to the psychology of really interesting, flawed people.","Having your work be the basis of fame, that's a far more stable feeling.","I don't really celebrate fame because I get enough attention.","I was fair-skinned in a country that's about the outdoors.","Even as a child I had a strong relationship with yearning and desire. And loss. Those things spoke to me.","I auditioned for the role of an angel in the Nativity play at school. I didn't get it. I auditioned for Mary; didn't get it. So I made up the character of the sheep who sat next to Baby Jesus.","Once I start putting all my little insecurities in my mind, I'm not actually acting. Then it's about me - and it should never be about me. It should be about the character.","You can still fight when someone can't talk."],"Nicole Krauss":["When the word 'nostalgia' was coined in the 18th century, it was used to describe a pathology - not so much a sense of lost time, but a severe homesickness.","I read like an animal. I read under the covers, I read lying in the grass, I read at the dinner table. While other people were talking to me, I read.","What interests me in writing a novel is taking really remote voices, characters, and stories and beginning to create some kind of web.","I think of novels as houses. You live in them over the course of a long period, both as a reader and as a writer.","I'm the opposite of someone like David Grossman, who knows how his characters walk, and how they smell. I don't allow myself to imagine what mine look like at all. My sense of them comes from the inside. They remain, by necessity, physically vague in my mind.","You can't imagine how hard I am on myself. Nothing pummels me like my own doubts, the feeling of how far I still have to go.","The accolades, just like the scrapes and bruises, fade in the end, and all you're left with is your ambition.","I always wrote little things when I was younger. My first opus was a book of poems put down in a spiral notebook at five or six, handsomely accompanied by crayon illustrations.","I used to think that if I had a choice between writing well and living well, I would choose the former. But now I think that's sheer lunacy. Writing weighs so much less, in the great cosmic equation, than living.","To hike out alone in the desert; to sleep on the valley floor on a night with no moon, in the pitch black, just listening to the boom of silence: you can't imagine what that's like.","I take almost no notes when I write. I have one notebook - this old green leather notebook that my dad gave me a decade ago.","My first novel, 'Man Walks Into a Room,' is about a man who's lost his memory and has to start a second life. On one level, it's about how we create a coherent sense of self.","To me, this is the singular privilege of reading literature: we are allowed to step into another's life.","Getting a book published made me feel a little bit sad. I felt driven by the need to write a book, rather than the need to write. I needed to figure out what was important to me as a writer.","I have realised just how important it is to readers to feel that fictional stories are based on reality.","I'm very interested in structure, how multiple stories are assembled in different ways; that is what memory does as well.","That powers my desire to write: the sense of how quickly everything on the surface of life can be cut away and you can suddenly be inside the most inner part of the most inner life of a person. What does it feel like there, and what are the regrets and sensations and longings, and what is the music of it?","I have always written about characters who fall somewhere in the spectrum between solitary and totally alienated.","The more freedom I allow myself as a writer to wander, become lost and go into uncertain territory - and I am always trying to go to the more awkward place, the more difficult place - the more frightening it is, because I have no plan.","I am always coming up with architectural metaphors when I think about writing. But I think one of the things that draw us to literature is that it gives us this very attractive illusion that there is meaning in the world - things connect.","If the book is a mystery to its author as she's writing, inevitably it's going to be a mystery to the reader as he or she reads it."],"Nicole Miller":["No matter what you do, black lace tends to look a little Spanish.","My mother is from Paris, so she was quite a fashion plate. I always had that French influence at home.","When I walk out on the street, I want to see everybody wearing my clothes.","I always had this thirst for excitement.","My last boyfriend used to always tell me, 'Grow up.' But I say, Why?","It's so boring to just hire a fancy caterer and have them do everything."],"Nicole Mones":["Chinese food tries to engage the mind, not just the palate. To provoke the intellect.","Food is the main engine that drives connectedness, relationship in Chinese society.","In the 1970s and early '80s, Shanghai was quiet, cautious, a ghost of a once-great city - and yet physically, little was changed from its glittering heyday. When visiting, I enjoyed reading books on local history and used my time off to scope out the former haunts of gangsters and jazzmen.","Both the nationalists and the communists disapproved of jazz and feared it. They thought it would weaken people's resolve to fight off the invasion. And most Americans know, China did ban all Western music for about 30 years, starting in 1949. This is where it started.","You know how someone - something - surprises you. You wake up a little bit. That's done through Chinese cuisine - for example, through dishes of artifice. That's a whole sub-tradition in Chinese cuisine. To create a dish that comes to the table looking like one thing but actually is something else.","They say that the cuisines of different Chinese provinces arose originally to serve different kinds of constituencies. Beijing was the cuisine of officials. In Shanghai, that was the cuisine of wealthy merchants and industrialists. In Szechwan, the food of the common people. Many great Szechwan dishes originated in street stalls.","Even though Japan and Germany were not formal allies at the time that Japan conquered Shanghai in 1937, still, Frenchtown was an area that Japan could take complete control of - and they did. And it was the locus of nightlife.","In my own life I studied music, not creative writing; I see a novel as music - an opening as an overture, themes and subplots as lines in a fugue. The chance to write a novel about a musician boxed in by all kinds of limitations but who plays out his ultimate struggle for freedom at the piano was irresistible.","You can't portray wartime Shanghai without writing about the Holocaust - about 25,000 Jews survived the Nazi death machine by taking refuge there."],"Nicole Polizzi":["I think the biggest misconception about me is people really don't know who I really am. They see the party side of me, they see the crazy side of me. But I also have a laid-back side. You know, I'm chill, down to earth. If you want to grab a cup of coffee and just talk about life, I can do that.","Don't let negativity affect your vision. A lot of people have said harsh things, but I don't let it affect me. If anything it gives me more enthusiasm and pushes me to do better in my career so I can prove them wrong.","Be sure of yourself, don't let anyone bully you, be a strong and independent woman or boy.","I don't have regrets, there are only lessons. You learn from them, and you become a better person.","When you're tan, you feel better about yourself.","You're going to have haters and you're going to have lovers.","It's hard for people to see you one way, but you're really the other way, so it's kind of like, 'Who am I, who are you?' Sometimes, I confuse even myself.","I think I just realized that having a problem - an eating disorder - it's not healthy and you can actually die from that. I realized it's not worth it and you just need to be healthy.","Some exfoliates have rocks in them and it makes your skin really smooth, and cat litter is a good substitute. I haven't broke out at all yet!","You have to remember that reality shows capture your worst moments.","When you're tanner, you feel hotter and sexier. You should try it.","I don't read. I don't like to read 'Harry Potter' or anything like that. It's not my style.","I don't go tanning anymore because Obama put a 10 percent tax on tanning. McCain would never put a 10 percent tax on tanning. Because he's pale and would probably want to be tan.","It sucks, but no Long Islands or margaritas when you drink. It has to be straight vodka.","It's always been a dream to have my own sunglass line and I'm so excited to be able to finally offer it to my fans!","People go tanning because they like to feel tan. You feel more sexy when you're tan and I don't understand why you would tax on that, because you're making yourself feel more happy about yourself.","No one knows that I'm smart.","Ten years from now, I would like to see myself successful as a brand, like Jessica Simpson, with babies running around and a beautiful husband and my own reality show.","We can't have cellphones, TV, radio or the Internet. If the president died, we'd have no idea. There's no normalcy. It's just like prison, with cameras.","It's important to be true to yourself and your vision.","I think you see more of like, the party side of me, which I call Snooki, it's kind of my alter ego.","I got bullied in high school. A lot of girls were so mean to me because their boyfriends wanted to hang out with me and my girls, so they pretty much bullied me to the point where I was crying at night.","I definitely want to get in shape and be healthy again.","Donald Trump, I would vote for him. Trump would make this country better I feel.","I like a guy who makes me laugh, doesn't care about the fame, the show, he just likes me for me, he likes Nicole.","Just want to set the record straight. I'm single and I'm not going to get married!","If I do something stupid, which is pretty much the whole time, I hate it. I just hate it.","Study hard, but party harder.","I always wanted my own fragrance because I could never find the right scent for me. At home, I would always mix bottles of my favorite fragrances to create a unique and different scent.","As I graduated high school, it didn't faze me anymore. Right now, I don't even care what people think of me. I'm happy with myself.","I'll always be this crazy, fun person, but when it's time to get married, I'm going to be an amazing wife.","So I would always try and be the lightest I could. In high school, I really wouldn't eat. I would only have lunch and I would only have salads. And then it got so crazy as to just eating like a cracker or a cucumber a day and I would feel full.","I think I want to move forward. I want to move to Brooklyn and find a business Italian guy to take care of me.","I went to school, I went to college. I know how to read. Even though I lack common sense sometimes, I am book smart.","I try and have family time, all the time, so you know, I get to see them a lot. And I'm always with my friends, my boyfriend, it helps me keep grounded and kind of sane.","But it's really hard to eat good when you're traveling because you see fast food and you want to go to this restaurant and that restaurant.","I've calmed down already. I don't hook up anymore.","I'm trying to build an empire, because after this, I cannot get a normal job.","I have an education, I went to college, you know?","The only person I've had sex with on Jersey Shore is my boyfriend.","The guys you see me bring home, we're only cuddling and making out like any other person would do, but we're on camera and the whole world's seeing it, and it does look like I'm having sex.","What I'd like is to turn out like Jessica Simpson, with her whole brand.","We all stick up for ourselves and I think that's why we stand out, because we really don't care what other people think."],"Nicole Richie":["My job ranges from creating the initial overall theme of the season, to developing fabrics and sketching to sampling and fitting.","But my everyday music is classic rock. It's what I relate to the most and where my heart is.","I do love to shop. But I'm a social shopper. I like to do it while hanging out with my friends. Some of them hate shopping because they treat it like something you have to plan, like a grocery list. But if I'm out and I pass a store, I just pop in.","I admire anyone with their own sense of personal style.","I think lingerie plays a big part in how you carry yourself.","I'm not insecure, but I'm not like, 'Hi, I'm confident.'","I have a responsibility, and it's something that I did wrong, and if I could personally apologize to every single person that has lost a loved one from drunk driving I would.","I was the one that put myself in rehab. I was the one that went to my parents and said, you know, 'I have a problem and I need to take care of it.'","Being a mentor is something that's new for me but a role that I take very seriously.","I will be really happy once I have done my jail time. I can start fresh.","When my dad divorced my mom it was kind of like him leaving me also.","I am extremely involved in the design process of both my brands, Winter Kate and House of Harlow 1960.","I've just gone through so much in my life that pulling my top up just doesn't seem like that big a deal.","Anytime I am around a male body part it is kind of exiting.","I absolutely love Oscar. So classic. So timeless.","I have olive skin, so if I get pale, I look green. I have to tan.","I tend to dress a little more sophisticated than most women do.","I was 21 and I got to film with my best friend.","I'm a Virgo and I'm really good at scheduling. And I really make it work. I get up 6.30 every day.","I know that it's a big struggle with a lot of women to dress up - especially now women have been working - because it can be uncomfortable. So it was important to me with my role to make clothes that are slightly more dressed up but easy to wear.","Clothing was something I always wanted to do. I've been pulling tear sheets from magazines since I was a little girl.","An eating disorder is serious and it's a disease, and I don't think you can lightly say that someone has a disease unless they're openly telling you that they do.","I also feel that I have been very honest with my friends, my family and also with the public about the mistakes that I've made and the challenges that I've gone through.","I live my life and I do what I do, and sometimes you forget that people are watching you.","'Fashion Star' has been an incredible platform to show America the amount of work and discussion that goes into each garment you see in a store.","I believe that fashion is the ultimate form if self expression therefore it really depends on my mood.","I am proud that my collections have received such praise, and I am even more proud to share the stage with so many talented designers.","It's been a pattern in my life - when I get in trouble, I try to get out of it, since I was little.","I owe the baby my life. I owe this baby everything and I have a responsibility now.","Besides being responsible for myself, I'm now responsible for someone else. And I have to set the right examples. I have to really be someone that I would want my child to look up to.","I would say my biggest mentor has been my father because he always has been. Actually both of my parents have always been ones to encourage me to be myself and stay true to myself and not fall into what other people want me to do.","It is important not to copy other people's careers but set the tone of who you want to be. My father's always encouraged me to do that.","When we were in the design studio I always was pretending like I was in a closet asking my friend before I step out into the world what do I look like? And everybody wants that honest friend before they go and go to dinner or go to an event.","I had lost relationships with my dad, my brother and sister and I was just like, you know what, this is definitely the time to just get it together and so that's what I did.","I mean I constantly had security guards around me when I was younger and I wasn't allowed to go to the mall with a lot of my friends and stuff like that. And so, when I finally was able to sneak out, I would just really, really take it to the next level.","I feel great, very healthy and alive and really happy that I can remember yesterday and I can remember the day before.","I think that British girls have a very eclectic and unique style.","Music is a huge part of my life, I enjoy every genre of music from jazz to country, and I even get down with a bit of hip hop.","As for style, there is something about the way musicians dress-they seem to be able to create their own world within their fashion alone.","The Winter Kate-House of Harlow 1960 customer is a multi-tasker, therefore it's important that they are able to put together an outfit with ease and elegance. Pieces that are easy to mix within their own wardrobe. Easy dressing while maintaining a well put together look.","You have to be comfortable in what you're wearing.","You can see it right away when a person is dressing outside of who she is.","Pack an outfit to change into on the plane.","I want to be happy and stable. My life is clearly going to slow down.","This year has been full of lessons learned and soul searching and realizing I'm an adult. It's time to take responsibility and not take the easy way out.","I never want to possibly take another life in my hands.","I think I look okay.","I definitely wouldn't mind gaining a few more pounds at all.","I think that people's weight fluctuates. It happens. It happens to everybody.","I am naturally a thin person and I am 5'1\" and putting on five or 10 pounds, that looks like a lot on me.","You know, I'm just - I'm really happy for my dad.","I've always stayed really close with my mother and my father.","I have really great friends.","I never want to disappoint my parents, ever. They are people that I always look up to.","I went to the University of Arizona. I stopped because I went there for two years and I felt like I experienced college or whatever. I'm over it. I like Hollywood better.","I think fame is harder when people have something to hide, but I'm very comfortable, and have nothing to hide."],"Nicole Scherzinger":["I love a man with a great sense of humor and who is intelligent - a man who has a great smile. He has to make me laugh. I like a man who is very ambitious and driven and who has a good heart and makes me feel safe. I like a man who is very strong and independent and confident - that is very sexy - but at the same time, he's very kind to people.","Girl power is about loving yourself and having confidence and strength from within, so even if you're not wearing a sexy outfit, you feel sexy.","You cry and you scream and you stomp your feet and you shout. You say, 'You know what? I'm giving up, I don't care.' And then you go to bed and you wake up and it's a brand new day, and you pick yourself back up again.","Confidence comes with maturity, being more accepting of yourself.","I think shoulders are sexier than cleavage.","It's important for a woman to feel good in her clothes. It's OK to have curves and to work them.","I've always had a fighter's spark in me. I was born with it. I think it's in my blood.","I'm a strong believer in 'everything is meant to be for a reason.'","I definitely have the eye of the tiger. I've fought my way to where I am and will continue to do so. I'm a hard worker - I get it from my family. We only know work. Nothing was handed to us. When I believe in something, I go after it. It's very hard to tell me 'no.'","I love what I do and I strive to be better; that's what keeps me going. I'm never a slacker, always a striver.","I don't really believe in diets. I love food... If I deprive myself, I'm going to want it more. I snack on yogurt, raw cashews and cherry tomatoes.","If believing in yourself and going after what you want in life and realising your worth is ruthless and selfish, then I'm definitely ruthless and selfish.","When you break a sweat you just feel great. You've got your endorphins going. You feel better. You look better. And if you aren't able to get a workout in, try to find a steam room somewhere. You just look and feel so much better after a sweat.","I come from a strong religious background, and I had a very conservative upbringing. So I was nervous, and confused. Here I was wanting to be Whitney Houston, so why did I have to dress in lingerie to do that? I didn't get it.","I can be quite daring with my clothes but I believe that you have to feel comfortable and confident to carry off whatever it is you're wearing.","My bulimia was my addiction. Hurting myself was my addiction... The music is what saved me. That's the only thing I can trust.","I was a shy kid, but somehow I knew I would make it as a performer. I'd always be telling my mum that I was going to be a famous singer. In my school yearbooks I would write, 'Remember me when I'm famous.' I knew I had a gift.","I never know if a song's going to be popular so I don't select them with that in mind. All I can do is follow my heart and my gut and go for songs that make me feel great.","I'm no diva but I can be annoying in a recording studio. Of course I try to be a diva in terms of confidence of performance and owning a song but I've never behaved like one in terms of the negative connotations of the word.","I'm going to take care of the man I'm with. I grew up in a household where my mum takes care of my dad - she cooks, she does everything - and that's the kind of girl I am.","It turns out that understanding the British public is not rocket science. The British appreciate honesty and they also have a bonkers, off-the-wall sense of humour like me.","I don't like my thighs, the back of my legs or my chubby knees. I wear clothes that show off my legs in pictures and videos but not often when I'm appearing live.","I think the sexiest thing about a man is that he's confident. Sure, sometimes you meet someone and you see his appearance first, but then you get to know him, and he looks completely different to you.","I was a very quiet, shy child. I grew up in a small town, Louisville, Kentucky, and there weren't too many Hawaiian-Filipino girls, so I stuck out like a sore thumb. I didn't look like everyone else and didn't feel I belonged... But these things only build character and make you stronger. It taught me to grow into the woman I was to become.","I've never seen myself as sexy. I see myself as a goofball.","In normal life people say, 'You're so different than on stage!' Offstage I'm down to earth, simple and a very goofy girl... I like to make goofy faces, be dorky and not take things too seriously. I just love to laugh.","The problem is I'm a perfectionist, so the producer might say he's happy with my vocal take but I'll say, 'No, it can be better.' I'll do it again and again until I feel I've got the truth out of a song.","I've always been too hard on myself to behave like I've arrived or even to enjoy whatever success I've had. I've always envisioned myself higher than where I was and I still do. With each success I think, 'That's nice but I'm supposed to go there!'","A lot of songs are empowering because everybody who has been through a hard time in a relationship or in their lives can relate to it.","I see lots of women having beautiful children later in life. And, if not, just freeze your eggs!","When I'm a mum, I'm not going to be one of those mums who has nannies. Actually, I might have nannies - never say never - but I'm not having someone else raise my kids.","When I hit my thirties, that's when I calmed down and I wasn't so tough on myself. I wasn't doing the yo-yo dieting any more. I gave myself a break. I think that, if you're more accepting of yourself, you're more free and open and can just allow more people in.","I'm way better in person than I am on things like Twitter. I know Twitter is the best and fastest way to connect with fans who really appreciate you but I'm still not cool with it - although I am trying! I try my best but I'm a one-on-one person and I don't want to tell people I'm on the toilet or I just brushed my teeth.","To be honest, I miss the old Hollywood way of having some mystique about the star.","Music is my passion - it's what I love and it's in my blood. You can never take me away from my work.","It takes time to really understand your body shape and it's taken me years to know what I can and can't pull off.","I'm definitely not the type to have a sing-off. I'm not catty like that. I sing for the right reasons.","Growing up, I was very conservative in my wardrobe, so when I first joined the Pussycat Dolls, the biggest challenge was wearing those cabaret costumes. I didn't feel comfortable showing my body so much, showing my legs and butt, chest and midriff.","My favorite songs are the ones that really come from the heart.","I love making down-home Southern cooking, and just chilling out and having cakes and pies and baking stuff, you know. I'm a pretty simple girl.","I would be a horrible lip-syncher. I would only ever sing live - that's why people come and see the show. It's not the easiest thing in the world to sing and dance at the same time, which is why I'm grateful to be able to do both.","Growing up, my mom was very strict about how I dressed and how I behaved, and I said to myself that I wasn't going to be like that. But now I know I'm going to be exactly like my mom. I'm going to be worse!","You know, I try to avoid Googling myself, but sometimes I slip up. Sometimes I just want to see how the world is viewing me on a particular day.","Love makes me vulnerable. In business I'm tough on myself - I'm like a drill sergeant. If I'm down, I'm used to getting right back up, but when it comes to love, your heart can't do that.","Although religion was around me my whole life I never felt it was forced upon me. It is my centring, my grounding, the soul of me. I feel I'm nothing without it."],"Nicole Sullivan":["My kitty cats could rely on my poker winnings.","I thought that somehow your life would be much different when you're famous... and it's not. You just buy more stuff.","I was only in LA for two weeks when I got that job. And I didn't work again for two years.","I'm friends with Hank Azaria. We were on a show together 800 years ago, and we laugh every single time.","If you want to be an actor, you need to learn how to act first, even in sketch comedy.","It's a lot easier, I think, to be an actor in a movie than to spin a joke on a sitcom.","It's the most amazing cast, a dream cast. We laugh all the time.","My mother, she's like, She can work on herself.","Once you're able to look like an idiot and be OK with it, it opens up your potential.","Part of me wanted something bloody and really fun.","There just are not a lot of overweight people in Hollywood.","When I look back to when I had my first son, I was unhappy. I couldn't understand why the weight wasn't just falling off.","When you are mad at yourself, you are mad at everybody."],"Nicole Trunfio":["I will pursue my passion of cooking every day until my hands fall off and I lose all sense of smell and taste.","I love the feel of good quality Italian black lace that feels delicate and really feminine.","Occasionally I will audition for a big overseas movie, but that's it.","I try to go to the gym three to four times a week and mix it up with yoga or a personal trainer.","I truly love Australia; I miss Aussie kids and their attitude!","I love not having a daily routine, just having the things I need with me and going anywhere in the world.","I like pieces that are cool and simple. I try to wear really cute things, but they just don't suit me at all.","Skin is really important; after all, it's my business.","My big break was when I won 'Search for a Supermodel Australia,' and then I came second in the world series, and that was all good, but I was just having fun; it wasn't real to me.","I get recognised in America.","Because I come from such a close family, my natural instinct is to marry and have kids as soon as possible.","I could definitely see myself living back in Australia again. If I had a family, I could move back.","I live in New York. I have an amazing apartment over there; I have this amazing life over there that's full of glamour. I get treated like a queen over there - and that's one of the reasons I love coming home. It's very grounding.","My weight is something that people seem to talk about a lot.","My mentors in life are much older than me and have been through life. They can actually give me some sound advice on what I'm going through.","I look up to people that are much older than me, so being a mentor is a full time job.","I haven't looked to my peers for advice because we're all going through the same thing. How do you ask your friends for advice when they're going through the exact same thing?","I have such a passion for theatre."],"Nicolle Wallace":["I think politics is like an X-ray machine: Everything is found out eventually.","People always related to President Bush, but in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the Iraq War, his numbers collapsed because people didn't feel like he handled those properly. Obama is the inverse. He was elected because he was an extraordinary guy, but the fact that he isn't ordinary has turned out to be politically damaging.","A lot of newsrooms have thought very carefully about how they cover race. I don't think the same conversations have gone on regarding women.","Campaigns bring out the warriors in everybody.","During the day, I don't read too much of the blog traffic, but then at night, I read transcripts of all of the network packages, and then I watch the wires and some of the political blogs.","I'm a huge fan of a Hillary Clinton candidacy. I think Hillary will be an incredibly strong candidate, and hopefully it will inspire my party to put up someone great.","Everybody wants to do 'The View.' It's this iconic show. When I worked at the White House, I used to watch the beginning to see what they were talking about. If a political topic was on their radar, I used it as ammunition with the president or the White House staff.","I like and respect Elisabeth Hasselbeck so much. I'm from a political party that represents half the country.","I never really thought that anyone thought there was just one kind of Republican woman.","If you're dating the quarterback and then you go out with the hockey player, you just go to the hockey games. I don't think I'll still go to the football games.","It would be absurd for me to diagnose Sarah Palin with a sprained ankle, let alone any sort of mental illness.","I wasn't the only one that saw Sarah Palin vacillate between glorious highs on the campaign trail - and, you know, while she was speaking and at the convention - to really troubling lows when she seemed stumped in interviews.","I worked for Sarah Palin. I have the political staffer version of P.T.S.D., so whenever I hear that she's breaking her silence, my heart stops.","Sometimes with the Palins, it's exactly what it looks like.","I was very much inspired by the things that I'd seen and done in politics, but I was also desperate for a complete departure from the reality of my political experience. 'It's Classified' and my previous book 'Eighteen Acres' are both works of fiction, but if they do seem realistic, it's by design.","The idea of a mentally ill vice president who suffers in complete isolation was obviously sparked by the behaviors I witnessed by Sarah Palin. What if somebody who was ill-equipped for the office were to ascend to the presidency or vice presidency? What would they do? How long would it take for people to figure it out?","The two pillars of winning the presidency are being a strong leader and being someone who understands us and our problems.","I'm not a fan of identity politics.","I don't think that a woman in politics exists or thrives on her own.","I love Carly Fiorina's fire; she's feisty as heck. She really seems to fearlessly take the fight right to the doorstep of the Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Chelsea Clinton Foundation.","There are probably many, many people who are better writers than me.","I worked in the White House on 9/11, where the vice president was given the authority to, if he deemed necessary, shoot down an American passenger jet.","I didn't have a special secret about Sarah Palin. I just had a feeling and some concerns. Her blank stares and her lashing out in some interviews, I think, gave voters pause about her, too.","A life in politics is for people who know themselves and know where their own line is between loyalty and honesty.","I am not someone who throws around the word 'self-esteem.' It is a fictional description.","Republicans have said much worse things about me than any Democrat ever has.","My husband saw me go through the 2008 campaign cycle. We did it together for Sarah Palin and John McCain. It ended disastrously, and afterward I really wanted to do something different, so I started writing novels, and I imagined a fictional female president in my head."],"Nicollette Sheridan":["There was this thing written that I had gone into a candle store, and my hair went up in flames because of all the hair spray. First of all, I never have hair spray in my hair, and I've never even heard of this store, and my hair has never been burned.","You can't trust the internet.","I came over when I was 10 years old, which was very difficult because everybody made fun of me.","I am being accused of all this plastic surgery, which is absolutely not true.","I grew up feeling like the ugly duckling, and things have not changed that much.","For some reason, Hollywood seems to have painted me as a gorgeous vixen at times or the sweet girl.","I'm actually more comfortable playing the stroke victim or the girl with no makeup on, looking scruffy and it's all about what's going on inside rather than on the outside.","I think I've always been a fighter in a healthy way."],"Nicos Anastasiades":["Cyprus was a breath away from economic collapse. It was a big battle in which we came out wounded, but upright and determined to make a fresh start.","The people of Cyprus have sent a strong message... of stability, credibility and change.","We have no intention of leaving the euro. In no way will we experiment with the future of our country.","The state of emergency and critical nature of the times do not allow me, as they do not allow anyone, to embark on a blame game.","My government, a government of national unity, will make all necessary structural reforms.","It's a Cyprus of misery and soup kitchens and a state which cannot meet basic obligations. It can only cause me grief.","I would like to thank the Cypriot people for their maturity and collectedness shown in their interactions with the Cypriot Banks.","The attitude of the people proves that not only do we want to, but that we can succeed in pulling our country out of the difficult position it finds itself in. The banking system of our country will survive and grow.","I was obliged to take tough, painful and bold decisions to ensure a manageable tomorrow."],"Nido Qubein":["Your present circumstances don't determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start.","For the timid, change is frightening; for the comfortable, change is threatening; but for the confident, change is opportunity.","What if you could be anything, or anybody, you chose to be? Think about it. What would you choose to be?","Nothing can add more power to your life than concentrating all your energies on a limited set of targets.","One of the greatest resources people cannot mobilize themselves is that they try to accomplish great things. Most worthwhile achievements are the result of many little things done in a single direction.","I only wish I had more time for fund raising.","Change brings opportunity."],"Niecy Nash":["Falling in love was the easy part; planning a wedding - yikes!","When I was growing up, Brandy was TV star, reality star, a pop star, a Cover girl, Grammy winner, had her own Brandy doll, and was the first African American to play Disney princess Cinderella. Most importantly, she is a survivor. Many only judge and remember a person's most recent failure.","The most valuable insight on choosing whom to love is to be honest with yourself about the man standing before you.","If you make your best friend and your significant other the same person, you don't have to disconnect to go tell your girlfriend everything.","The soul of a woman is so important to maintain given all that is on our plates. Figuring out how to do it can be a little tricky. My prayer was, 'Lord, please help me. How can I do it all and not be overwhelmed? How can I do it all and still be happy?' His answer: Find the stolen moments of joy in all you do.","If there is someone in your life who is not serving you or making you better, give yourself permission to move on.","There's a lot of women out there, some of whom are my age who've never been married and some who have been married and would like to be married again but think their ship has sailed, and I'm like, 'Oh no, honey, let Miss Niecy show you it is never too late for love!'","As women, we often think we have to be all things to all people, all at the same time. As a wife, mother, actress and businesswoman, I definitely feel the pressure to perform well in all areas.","In one day, I got mistaken for three different actresses: Wendy Williams, Sherri Shepherd, and Star Jones.","I'm a Gucci girl all the way.","I have more energy to run after our four children. Weight loss and great skin were a bonus!","My house is full of antics, mayhem, foolishness, carrying on, cutting up, shucking and jiving, and I have that whether cameras are there or not. Our youngest just had us up with her shenanigans and hijinks all night. So, it's all the time, even off camera.","One of the greatest gifts that God has given us is free will. Even though it's free, we don't take advantage of it as much as we could when it comes to matters of the heart.","I have an extra set of eyelashes because you never know. I could cry or laugh, or it could be windy, and I'll need a standby pair.","I do not have a bride gene. I haven't been planning a wedding since I was 3. I never put a sheet on my head and pretended that it was a veil.","There's nothing wrong with having a collection, but it becomes a problem when it overwhelms your space. When you're not displaying it properly, you're not enjoying it and it turns into clutter.","I'm genuine and I'm available. I want people to be at their best. I want them to love and be loved to their fullest ability. My friends call me their relationship nanny, so we have a good time working through problems. Now, I don't claim to be an expert, but I am a woman who has been through everything.","I've been married, divorced; I've been the baby momma, the side piece and the secret... all of these things. I share it in an effort to make people better.","I don't have a desire to do reality. Because my truth is not what people are responding to. My truth is funny; I laugh with my husband every day.","I don't need to do a reality show to make my mark in this world.","Even after I got my divorce, the ink wasn't even dry on the paper, and I said, 'Ooh, the next time I become a wife, I got this thing down pat!' I always believed that there was someone built for me.","Let me tell you, if I could pick the project of all projects, it would probably be Kate Gosselin because if I can help Kate find a man? I can help anybody!","No family should have to endure the loss of a loved one at the hands of a previously convicted violent criminal.","I am deeply saddened to hear that the man who murdered my brother, Michael Ensley, has been charged with murder again. I grieve for every family who has been victimized by this heinous individual. My prayers and love go out to the family of Demetra Doyle Heard during this trying time.","Let me tell you something. I'm a funny girl, and I gave birth to what? Funny. I can't help it. It just is what it is, and my kids have been around my antics so long, it kind of rubs off a little bit. So when it comes to what you see, you only see what is really manifesting in our lives at the time.","The adage 'a family that prays together, stays together' is so true.","I don't claim to be an expert on love. I'm just a woman who has experienced a lot of things, and I want to share and hopefully my sharing will help make your situation better, because that's the goal.","The truth is black celebrities are not as sought after in the press as white celebrities, and that is comforting.","I didn't get into this business for other people to know my name.","As a little girl, my destiny was stamped onto the canvas of my imagination at 5 years old. I was watching soaps with my grandmother... The most gorgeous black women I had ever seen in my life came out, and I knew that that is what I wanted to do - be fabulous and black and on TV.","I didn't marry a man that wanted to be in the business. But that's why we're a perfect fit.","Although my marriage left me with three beautiful children, it also left me with a healthy dose of self-doubt, low self-esteem, and an extreme desire to be loved again. I was operating on empty, expecting to be paid in full.","The old adage is true, people will only be as good to you as you are to yourself. They will follow your example, and those who don't will be left by the wayside.","When I was being honest with myself, I had to own that there was something about me that was drawing an energy in my life that left me feeling underserved and unfulfilled. I decided to grow. I decided to purge myself of anyone and anything that was not full of goodness, serving me or making me happy.","You may not be able to help whom you are attracted to, but you can choose to whom you love and how. That is to say that love is a commitment that your heart and your mind make. It is an active and ever-evolving process, a conscious choice that takes effort and maintenance.","Don't go telling yourself you're in love with the man he could be; you gotta love the man standing in front of you right now. Simply put, love the person not the potential! Otherwise, he will always be disappointing to you. And whose fault is that?","When you like what you like, it makes it easy for your husband to shop for you!","I feel like love is the thing we were created for, yet it's the place we struggle the most.","I'm not a perfect mom, but I'm perfect for my kids.","There are a lot of actors who don't like reality stars 'cause they feel these people aren't accomplished. They haven't done this or that, but they are savvy. They have found a way to make it work. I could dissect your career all day long, but I'm focused on my own career.","Reality does get a bad rap. But I'm not concerned about it 'cause I know who I am. They can edit it, but you are in charge of what you do.","We are bred to compare ourselves to the next person, to what they have and what they have accomplished.","I would like to think that television would be representative of the world we live in.","I've known for quite a while that I was a funny girl.","I'm a work in progress. You know, my kids didn't come with instructions... and neither did this business, so when I put the two of them together, I gotta take it a little at a time.","When I got married in 1991, I had never been to a wedding, so I didn't know that my wedding was tacky. I didn't know that I was getting married in a quinceanera dress, because there was nobody there to cry over me and tell me I look like a fool.","I don't want to be Carrie Bradshaw. I don't want the wedding to be bigger than Big. I'm just grateful to know that the first time I fell in love wasn't the last time.","I didn't start out about weight loss. I was very tired and my energy was low. This is my second go-around in love, so I want to make sure I'll be around to enjoy it.","I recently finished a job, an HBO movie 'Getting On,' a very dark comedy. It comes from a British series of the same name. In this role I have no hair, no make up and no nails. I play a very small role; she is not over the top and sassy.","No one's playing records anymore, so find your favorite and frame it, then get rid of the rest - try selling or donating them.","Celebrate your child's achievement, then rotate it when the next mini-masterpiece comes along. Then chuck the old picture. Don't worry that you're throwing away a memory. Your children will remember your praise more than they will remember the picture with macaroni and glitter glued on it."],"Niels Arden Oplev":["Because revenge is a very known feeling in American culture, there's a certain element of an eye for an eye. There's the saying, 'Be careful what you wish for, you might get it.' When you wish for revenge, and you think you've gotten it, what happens then? Revenge is just a really good drive for drama and good action.","'Deity' will be a compelling and exciting thriller with complex and interesting characters. A neo-realistic style to story and images will take the audience deep into Calcutta's many different levels. A fascinating clash between American and Indian culture.","It is cool to make a pilot because you get to do all the fun stuff, and then you get to leave when all the tough stuff starts.","I'm interested in the human more than I'm interested in building suspense.","When you cast, you can't cast only visually; you have to cast emotionally, too.","I think 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is a good example of a film where you have to juggle a whole lot of information to follow that story, and even if you haven't read the book, it seems to go pretty well. And that is a film where the characters didn't meet until 74 minutes into the film, not on page 17.","On Staten Island, there's a ship graveyard. I'm using that a lot, even for 'Under the Dome.' When I'm dissatisfied with a location scout, I go on Google Earth. It's an amazing tool.","I think filmmaking is a strange animal because it's anti-Democratic and collective at the same time, but I think it's all about not trying to know everything better than everybody else but making the right choices.","I think if there was no violence in our world, there would be no violence in film. Violence is a part of human nature, and obviously it's a troublesome part of human nature. You always have responsibilities when you portray violence in what angle you put down on that scene.","We need to keep examining evilness. For instance, I'm totally against the fact that Osama bin Laden was shot. I think that he should have been put on trial and exposed as that human being he was. I think he should've been standing mentally naked in front of the rest of us and stand to justice for what he did.","Nobody's born evil. I guess that's why we're drawn to violence. We're fascinated by it, but there's a moral in how you examine it.","The thing with 'The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo' is that is it's like an Agatha Christie plot, and an investigating journalist is also a classic character.","When we read a book, we have a blurry image that's kind of physical but blurry. But we have an emotional image also. We have an emotional connection to the character."],"Niels Bohr":["An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made, in a narrow field.","Every great and deep difficulty bears in itself its own solution. It forces us to change our thinking in order to find it.","If quantum mechanics hasn't profoundly shocked you, you haven't understood it yet.","Technology has advanced more in the last thirty years than in the previous two thousand. The exponential increase in advancement will only continue.","Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future.","No, no, you're not thinking; you're just being logical.","Everything we call real is made of things that cannot be regarded as real.","How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress.","When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images.","The best weapon of a dictatorship is secrecy, but the best weapon of a democracy should be the weapon of openness.","The opposite of a fact is falsehood, but the opposite of one profound truth may very well be another profound truth.","It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how Nature is. Physics concerns what we say about Nature.","Einstein, stop telling God what to do!","Every sentence I utter must be understood not as an affirmation, but as a question.","There are some things so serious you have to laugh at them.","Your theory is crazy, but it's not crazy enough to be true.","Never express yourself more clearly than you are able to think.","A physicist is just an atom's way of looking at itself.","Humanity will... be confronted with dangers of unprecedented character unless, in due time, measures can be taken to forestall a disastrous competition in such formidable armaments and to establish an international control of the manufacture and use of the powerful materials.","While the finish given to our picture of the world by the theory of relativity has already been absorbed into the general scientific consciousness, this has scarcely occurred to the same extent with those aspects of the general problem of knowledge which have been elucidated by the quantum theory.","Every description of natural processes must be based on ideas which have been introduced and defined by the classical theory."],"Nigel Barker":["People think New York is this big city where no one knows each other, but when you live in the Village, it's the opposite.","For a selfie, it's not about the pose, it's about you. There's a reason why you look great in the picture or you look great in real life, because someone has caught the essence of who you are, and a pose is not you.","Capturing a beautiful moment in a photo is something I'm very passionate about.","The life you're leading is the sexiest part of you.","Someone who is comfortable, someone who is happy, you see them immediately sit up, stand up and feel better about themselves. If you're able to capture that in a picture, that's the most beautiful picture you can ever take of someone.","I am always on the go; being a photographer, filmmaker, author and a father, things become stressful, and it is important to find time to escape for a few minutes.","My go-to necktie is jet black, skinny, and simple. It goes with everything. I really like that mod-ish punk look.","Everyone gets a pencil as a kid, but it doesn't make them all authors or painters or drawers or anything else.","Certainly, people feel awkward when they have their photograph taken. They want to see it, but they don't want to see it.","My favorite memory is Tomorrow. Tomorrow's family moments are what I look forward to every day. No single favorite. Just Tomorrow.","If I am to judge others, I should be subject to be judged. You make your bed, you must lie in it.","I photograph different people all the time. I like to shoot all kinds of people.","I got a camera when I was nine years old and it wasn't until I was a model that I realized you could be a photographer for a job.","Kate Moss is small and not necessarily model dimensions but she has that special something.","I have a book out called 'The Beauty Equation' and it discusses how off track we have gone in considering beauty.","I'm truly excited to align with Art.co.uk and share with the world the wondrous sites and travels I've experienced.","Nonni's Biscotti Bites fit perfectly in my camera bag for a spontaneous break between photo shoots.","I'm happy to help Crest Whitestrips on their mission to inspire photographers everywhere to capture smile moments and would encourage aspiring photographers to express themselves through their photos.","Even though photographers are only shooting the outside, beauty is more about who you are as a person - the life you lead - not your facade.","For guys, growing older is fine. Gray hair and wrinkles aren't considered a bad thing.","As soon as you 'Botox' your smile lines away, you lose part of your identity.","There's almost an element of selfies that is like photo therapy. People look upon themselves in a picture and then they critique themselves without knowing so, and that's what's happening on mass on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.","For me the most important thing to do in a selfie is to have an opinion and to say something with the picture. Don't just take a picture of yourself like, 'Here I am.' It's what are you thinking? Are you happy? Are you angry? Do you like it? Do you not like it? Think an emotion and apply it to your eyes.","I'm much more about the emotion that a photograph provokes out of you and less about how technically brilliant it is.","Write 'judge of beautiful women' on my tombstone. I'd be quite happy.","Whenever you do anything public, you open yourself up to be criticized.","I think if more designers designed clothes with a more fuller figure in mind, it would represent women in a greater sense.","Within the modeling industry, there's no doubt that there are some girls out there that are too thin. But there are also girls who are genetically slim and can eat like a horse.","My family are everything to me. They come first in everything I do.","My daughter's first sentence was, 'Dada no hair.' And I was, like, 'No Jasmine, Dada does have hair, Dada just shaves his head.'","It's ironic to watch a dress on a mannequin or a model on a catwalk who's not anything like the person that's going to buy it.","I have two little kids, and they both came out completely different, with their own personalities.","Designers simply can't afford to make dresses in 10 sizes for a sample.","Many reality shows have failed because everyone's acting.","In life, you don't judge people on how they are at home, you judge them on how they are at work.","If you are going out, and if you want women to pick you up, wear skinny jeans. Trust me: women will be looking at your legs and looking at your butt. When I wear skinny jeans, at least one woman will tell me, 'Nice butt.'","I once died my hair blonde, and it looked like an orangey-red carrot top. It was the '80s, and I was trying to look like George Michael. At the time, the ladies loved it, and I loved it too!","I always wanted to be a zoologist. I'm fascinated with animals. I wanted to be a zookeeper.","My wife is a size zero and eats more than I do, and I'm a 6'4\", 225 lb. man!"],"Nigel Cole":["It seems to me that romantic comedies used to be about falling in love, but in recent years they've really become just comedies where the love story is only there as a spine to hang the jokes on.","I think your 20s are the hardest part of life. I mean, everyone goes on about how hard it is to be a teenager, but actually I think it's tougher to be in your 20s because you're expected to be a grownup and expected to earn your own living and be successful and I think you feel like a kid still.","I think the first rule of comedy is that it has to be funny and I find a lot of the broad comedy which is sent to me, painfully unfunny.","I can't find anything wrong with Ashton Kutcher. I think he's great. It's odd that in America there's a very mixed reaction to him. I think those that have only seen him on 'Punk'd' or 'That 70s Show' get him wrong. There's much more to him than those characters or that persona he plays in those shows.","I think films about men are often about characters who don't want to express their feelings. You're supposed to kind of admire them for not expressing their feelings. And I feel that's a bit dull. Women's stories often have stronger emotional content, which I enjoy doing. What I really love doing is mixing that with humor.","I'm not making films for middle aged journalists, who are mostly men. I make films that hopefully entertain people, where they can learn something about life.","In England we only make films about the working class or the aristocracy.","In the States everyone aspires to be middle class. It's so engrained into the American psyche: As long as you work hard you're going to be rich some day. The history of Britain is that if you're born working class, you're going to stay there, although that is changing.","Amongst my friends, I am known as the most cynical person they know - I'm incredibly cynical. I don't believe in God, I don't believe in the supernatural, I don't believe in anything! And I'm terribly cynical, and somehow or other, all three of my films and much of my television work has been rather sentimental, and 'heartwarming'.","I really ought to try and make a film that's a bit more cynical. But I don't think I'd know how to do it. I think what it is, is that if you're a film director, you're basically there because you enjoy manipulating people's emotions.","The popular image that Hollywood is ruined by difficult prima donna actors is nonsense. They're certainly very nice to directors. I can't say the same about producers, who I found difficult, paranoid, and certifiably insane, mostly.","Making a movie in Hollywood is a bit like playing a board game, where you have to throw a six to start."],"Nigel Dennis":["All I really wanted to do was wildlife photography.","I also had a tremendous passion for art and read a lot.","Photography started as a means of getting reference material for my paintings of nature subjects.","So about twenty years ago I gave up on painting - and got into terrible debt after buying a load of camera gear!","My first serious project was photographing badgers - very, very difficult as they are shy and nocturnal.","I concentrate on the southern African subcontinent.","I would never dream, for example, of going to The States to photograph your wildlife.","In The States I would have no edge, no advantage at all.","The Kalahari is brilliant - and easy to visit.","Currently I am working on another three books, doing a lot of magazine work, am shooting for fifteen stock agencies, plus my own photo library - all this keeps me quite busy!","Even for an area I know well, I prepare a shooting list of subjects I need.","I carry a notebook full of sketches of pictures I want to take - they are really scruffy sketches, but at least I am going out there with a clear objective.","A large wildlife book, start to finish, could take one to two years, but then I would expect to get several good (nature) magazine features off the back of this, plus of course a lot of stock.","Big game photography in Africa is mainly done from a vehicle, so then I feel I might as well take the lot.","For the first few years we lived in a tiny rented cottage at the bottom of a friend's garden. We often joked that there was plenty of film in the fridge, but not too much food!","I think few wives would have encouraged this kind of drastic and reckless career shift!","For sure, all over Poland, kids had my picture of a lemur on their bedroom wall - but the chances are they may never get to see a real lemur in Madagascar. I thought this was great and it really meant a lot to me.","I hope to goodness I would not still be working in the corporate world - the money is OK but it is no life at all.","I also like flyfishing - maybe I would have figured a way to make a living out of that?"],"Nigel Farage":["I think NATO needs to redefine itself. There has been no substantial thought about what NATO is for since the Berlin Wall came down.","It's a two-way street: breastfeeding women should never be embarrassed by staff asking them to stop, and most mums will recognise the need to be discreet in certain limited circumstances.","The Leave side can only win if we have an effective ground campaign comprising of activists from across the political spectrum working together.","We shouldn't measure everything in terms of GDP figures or economics. There is something called quality of life.","I've always been the outsider. I've always been regarded as some extraordinarily dangerous figure. I'm none of those things! I'm just a middle-class boy from Kent who likes cricket and who happened to have a strong view about a supernational government from Brussels.","Quite simply, without UKIP, there would not have been a referendum. I am convinced that the 'we want our country back, we want our borders back' message that we took across the country on an open-top double decker energised non-voters to back Brexit.","The banking collapse was caused, more than anything, by bad government policy and the total failure of bad regulation, rather than by greed.","Brexit was the first brick that was knocked out of the establishment wall.","It's about mass immigration at a time when 21% of young people can't find work. It's about giving £50 million a day to the EU when the public finances are under great strain.","I've got to see the Brexit process through. we won the war, but we must win the peace.","The real question is, at the end of the day, do we want to run our country? Are we proud of who we are? Are we happy to be just a star on somebody else's flag, or do we want to be an independent nation?","There are two completely different Britains. There's London, and there's the rest of Britain. Attitudes are very different.","Building walls is entirely sensible. We don't need to do it. We have got the English Channel.","Predictions are a mug's game.","Either you support the existing global elite, or you want real change and believe in nation-state democracy.","My opponents are the people who gave up our borders.","Only by working together, as a broad coalition, can the Leave side win.","When people stand up and talk about the great success that the EU has been, I'm not sure anybody saying it really believes it themselves anymore.","My vision is to put this country and the British people first and for us to divorce ourselves from political union and re-engage with the rest of the world.","Brexit will happen.","The referendum was clear: the British people voted to leave the single market and to take back control of our borders.","I'd love to tell you that everyone who voted Brexit felt like me about the country, about the Union Jack and the cricket team. But I don't think that there's as much romanticism in it, perhaps, as people think.","I have to confess I do have a slight preference. I do think, naturally, that people from India and Australia are in some ways more likely to speak English, understand common law, and have a connection with this country than some people that come perhaps from countries that haven't fully recovered from being behind the Iron Curtain.","Before, Europe was about treaties, laws and our sovereign right to govern ourselves. Now, it's about everyday lives.","Greece isn't a democracy now it's run through a troika - three foreign officials that fly into Athens airport and tell the Greeks what they can and can't do.","The people who get up earliest in the morning have the highest propensity to vote UKIP. I'm being absolutely serious about that.","I judge everybody on the Farage Test. Number one, would I employ them? Number two, would I go for a drink with them?","I think that politics needs a bit of spicing up.","Having established that good ideas do indeed come in from the cold, start on the fringes and become mainstream, can we make any predictions about what the next move will be?","Maybe this will be the beginning of a trend? Flat taxes, cutting foreign aid, a referendum on Europe, grammar schools. Who knows?","That Obama creature - loathsome individual - he couldn't stand our country.","Donald Trump believes in nation-state democracy; Hillary Clinton used the E.U. as a prototype for a larger global union. Donald Trump believes in sensible immigration controls.","The great skill of investment is to know when the right time is to get out. Getting in's easy.","It's about businesses nervous about taking on school leavers because of a mass of red tape. It's about health and safety regulations and green fines.","Puppet Papademos is in place, and as Athens caught fire on Sunday night he rather took my breath away - he said violence and destruction have no place in a democratic country.","I think frankly when it comes to chaos you ain't seen nothing yet.","It's the FSA and its plethora of EU bodies that's failed.","I suppose, being in politics, it wasn't a job - it was almost a calling. It dominated my life, so I do think that probably a lot of people around me have paid quite a big price for that.","Hopefully, through all aspects of life, you learn from things you've got right, things you've got wrong, but I'm not one for looking back. I'm looking ahead; you've got to.","Whatever my faults, I have some principles.","I can distinctly remember being the only boy in my class whose parents had separated.","Saying you don't want to enter every potential war in the Middle East doesn't make you an isolationist; it makes you wise.","I think I am quite a good listener.","How can you compare my life to any other MEP? I mean, come on, it's crackers, isn't it? Look, other MEPs do five days a week in Brussels and pop home for weekends. I'm working seven bloody days a week, all the hours God sends. If you include the socialising, it's over 100 hours a week.","There is no Left and Right any more. Left and Right is irrelevant... We need big change. We've got to get back control of our country.","This Constitution does not reflect the thoughts, hopes and aspirations of ordinary people. It does nothing for jobs or economic growth and widens further still the democratic deficit.","Perhaps our own opposition to even the level of European integration we have now, let alone any more, is well known.","I'm the catalyst for the downfall of the Blairites, the Clintonites, the Bushites, and all these dreadful people who work hand in glove with Goldman Sachs and everybody else, have made themselves rich, and ruined our countries. I couldn't be happier.","When you get back control of your country, you get proper democracy. You get back proper debate.","Let's get real: would any American president seriously open up their borders unconditionally to Mexico as the U.K. has done to the whole of the E.U.? No chance.","It's a European Union of economic failure, of mass unemployment and of low growth.","But there's certainly only one thing I could never agree with George Galloway on. He's a teetotaller and wants to close all the bars in the House of Commons. That is just not on.","We must break up the eurozone. We must set those Mediterranean countries free.","We have a Conservative leader that believes in green taxes, that won't bring back grammar schools, that believes in continuing with total open-door migration from eastern Europe and refuses to give us a referendum on the EU.","If I was a Greek citizen I'd be out there trying to bring down this monstrosity that has been put upon those people.","Minimum sales prices for alcohol are a startlingly bad idea. As with excise duties, the effects are regressive.","The great and the good will decide what is good for us and make sure that we get what is good for us, good and hard.","It's hardly a radical idea to suggest that regulators and legislators understand the law now, is it?","I have been unsure, from the start, what the Occupy movement was all about, although I did suspect that it was just fatuous, anti-enterprise, left-wingery.","When an Occupy demo in the centre of Frankfurt makes world news, I shall hurry to join in.","I have become increasingly used to the Tory party mimicking our policies and phrases in a desperate effort to pretend to their members they are still Eurosceptic.","British chancellor is telling the rest of Europe it must abandon democracy. It's appalling.","I have invested the best part of my adult political life in helping to try to build up this movement and I am far from perfect but I do think I am able, through the media, to deliver a good, simple, understandable message.","I believe I can lead this party from the front as a campaigning organization.","It's amazing how ideas start out, isn't it?","If an idea is indeed sensible, it will eventually become just part of the accepted wisdom.","I like to think I've changed the centre of gravity on lots of national debates.","I love Europe! France is wonderful. It should be. We've subsidised it for 40 years.","For seven years, I had a business relationship in Milan, Milano. Dealing with Italians, just, let me tell you... Are we the same? Good lord, no! That's why Europe's fun - it's fun because it's different. A political project that seeks to make it all the same - it's ghastly.","I've stood down as UKIP leader. I'm not responsible for these people anymore.","There is a debate in Ukip as to how strong we should be on the immigration issue. I personally think we should own it.","However imperfect Donald Trump may be, -and, my goodness, he is - his mother was Scottish; he owns Turnberry. He spends a lot of time in our country - he loves our country, what we stand for, and our culture.","All marriages, all relationships have huge ups and downs.","I don't look back at anything. I look forwards.","I don't listen to music. I don't watch television, I don't read.","When I'm finished with politics, I'll have a richer life. I'd like to go to the theatre.","There are little games that go on in politics.","There are millions out there who aren't getting an even break. They're being done down.","I just say it as I see it, behave as I do. If people don't like it, they can take a running jump.","No one did more singlehandedly to smash the BNP in Britain than me.","We've been very lucky to have UKIP in the U.K. If we hadn't been here, the BNP would be doing very well.","If you take away people's identity and their ability through the ballot box to determine their future, don't be surprised if they turn to extremes or violence or anything else.","If you poke the Russian bear with a stick ,he will respond.","Potentially, I would be very interested in being a shock jock, though Ofcom might be tricky. Some of the American stuff is appalling, wild stuff, crazy conspiracy theories.","I believe that the ability to talk to people and have them feeling engaged rather than patronised isn't something you can learn. It's a bit like being able to sing or play cricket. You can either do it, or you can't.","UKIP believe that immigration can be an extremely positive thing. But it has to be controlled.","We used to fight for democracy. Democracy used to matter. We now treat it with contempt. We have turned our backs on values that we built up over hundreds of years, for the benefit of politicians in Europe. To me, that is heartbreaking.","We, as a party, are colour-blind.","I think the employer should be much freer to make decisions on who she or he employs.","I have made comments in favour of British people getting jobs over and above those from southern eastern Europe.","Will I ever forgive the British media for what they've done to me? No.","We have good and bad archbishops.","We can't completely isolate ourselves from international terrorism and the problem the world faces.","Normally, when New York catches a cold, London sneezes.","I can't think of a single example of two mature democracies going to war with each other in the 20th century. It's where there was an absence of democracy and a breakdown of democracy that we finish up with these wars.","I'm not giving up politics entirely - I'm just giving up leadership of a political party.","It's a great shame that the head of our established church is not actually prepared to stand up and fight for our Christian culture in this country.","I think that, given that some people feel very embarrassed by it, it isn't too difficult to breastfeed a baby in a way that's not openly ostentatious.","Post-Brexit, we got a chance to start all over again with a president in Trump, who is Anglophile. He is pro-British. He knows the things we've shared together over the years - the good and the bad.","I want us to move as quickly as we can towards a free trade deal between the U.K. and the U.S.A. that would be good for both of us. That would also send a signal to the European Union that there's a bigger world outside of the European Union, and Britain can manage just nicely.","My desperation for UKIP to do well meant that I really packed the diary and the day in a way that, frankly, wasn't very bright.","Do we look horrendous when people don't work together? Oh, God, yes. If the leave campaign is not prepared to show that it's big enough and ugly enough to put aside party differences in the interests of this great cause, then it has a great problem.","There are a lot of great people in UKIP.","I have no regrets about being poor.","I don't drive smart cars; I don't go on fancy holidays. All my money has gone on my kids' education.","I'm quite good at bringing people together.","I go to bed very late and get up very early. If I get five hours, I am very happy.","Being over-rehearsed is very bad. It is stilted. The public see that.","I can be impatient. I can be a bit short sometimes. You're nearly always shortest with those who are most important to you.","People in business tend to have an instinctive reaction to people.","For whatever reason, Trump likes my story, likes what I've done. He trusts me.","I spent 17 years inside an institution trying to effectively destroy it; can you imagine how popular I am in Brussels? I am the most hated figure that's ever been in that place. Every time I get up to speak, hundreds of people boo and jeer.","Virtually every aspect of our commercial lives have been given away to be run by European project over which we had so little say.","I hate big government; I hate being told what to do on a personal basis.","I'm not for laws. We need a minimum of laws.","I'm not for sale.","Brexit is the best thing to happen for Russia, for America, for Germany, and for democracy.","In some ways, backing the Trump campaign was even harder than battling for Brexit. I received almost total condemnation, including from many senior figures in my own party.","I have known several of the Trump team for years, and I am in a good position with the President-elect's support to help.","The only people to whom myself and the immigration issue is toxic are to the well-heeled committed Remain voters, the sort of people who live in the Hannan and Carswell world.","Although I never wanted Theresa May to be our Prime Minister, I had been prepared to give her the benefit of the doubt.","I did not endorse Trump, because I had condemned President Obama for telling us what to do in our referendum. But I did say that if I was a U.S. citizen, I would not vote for Hillary Clinton even if she paid me.","The E.U. referendum was promised by a Conservative Prime Minister fearful of losing votes and of mass defections to UKIP.","The Corbynista brand of politics representing metropolitan, middle class, pro-open border values is far removed from millions of Labour voters, especially those who voted Leave in the referendum.","UKIP's success would never have happened without the invention of YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.","Whilst there are problems with Article 50, it is the statement of intent that is important.","Though I've never been a supporter of big government, the reclamation of our fisheries, which, done correctly, would be worth several billion pounds a year, should be a cabinet position with its own department.","Whatever threats Remain may continue to fire at us, they cannot answer the simple and most basic proposition: that only by leaving the European Union can we control the numbers coming to our country.","How can any government arrange sensible healthcare provision for citizens when the migratory flow is so large, with absolutely no power or control over the quantity coming in every year?"],"Nigel Hamilton":["Thanksgiving is a time of togetherness and gratitude.","Listening to the stories my colleagues are researching and grappling with - in terms of access to documents, psychological understanding of their subjects, artful composition and determination to extrapolate from an individual's life lessons and insights that we can all learn from - I am each time overwhelmed by joy.","The moral was, in time of anarchy, tough leadership is the only solution - even though the collateral damage may be heartbreaking. Mrs. Thatcher's strident, take-no prisoners approach was in some ways repugnant, but it was surely necessary.","Our only president who has died as U.S. commander in chief in war is Franklin Delano Roosevelt - who died of a cerebral hemorrhage or massive stroke on April 12, 1945, only three weeks before the unconditional surrender of the German armed forces he had laid down as implacable Allied policy two years before.","We've sweated and torn out our hair trying to reconstruct our chosen lives, to fashion them like literary sculptures, at once monumental and yet human. We've applied all of our intelligence, our empathy, our critical faculties, our compassion - and we think, in our delusion, that it's still 1960, and our work is going to get noticed.","As a student, I had stayed with Winston Churchill; later, I had lunched with Harold Macmillan - in fact, had met most of the post-war prime ministers of Great Britain from Douglas-Home to Tony Blair.","That's the miracle of Amazon! It's like Internet dating. In the early days, you could get slimed as an author on Amazon by someone bearing a grudge, or jealous, or whatever. And because there were so few reviews posted, this stank.","In publishing 'JFK: Reckless Youth' almost twenty years ago, I had gotten into trouble myself with the Kennedys. Not because of my portrait of JFK - which was highly laudatory - but because I had described his parents, Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, in less-than-flattering terms.","At times, the reader of World War II literature must think every American, from general to G.I., kept a war diary, later mined for memoirs of the conflict. Few diaries, however, were published in their own right.","I once wrote that Lord Moran, Churchill's doctor, had doctored his diaries as well as his famous patient. That was true but unfair. Although their authenticity as contemporary, daily accounts is often questionable, the observations are quite wonderful.","I became an American on Nov. 4, 2010, at an elegant ceremony in Great Hall of Bullfinch's Faneuil Hall, Boston, beneath a vast painting of Daniel Webster debating the preservation of the Union with Robert Hayne of South Carolina, before the Civil War.","In my case, I belong to a group of aspiring and practicing biographers in Boston. We meet once a month for a coupla hours. It's become my lifeline - forgive the pun.","The story of FDR as U.S. Commander in Chief is a heroic war story of a president who had already overcome great adversity in facing polio but who went on to take the reins of our armed forces in the greatest conflagration in human history - on our behalf.","We should honor Franklin Delano Roosevelt today as the greatest commander in chief of the Armed Forces of the United States in our history, bar none - including President Lincoln.","Traditionally Presidents Day was Washington's birthday. It was celebrated as a public holiday on February 22 each year, in peace or in war.","I grew up and lived in a Britain in which strikes and the threat of strikes had become part of the social fabric - and it was not very nice.","My father had risen in the British Army under the revolutionary aegis of General Montgomery, who was mad about training for battle, not muddling into disaster.","Republican isolationists had certainly tied the hands of every U.S. president, year after year - berating Franklin Roosevelt in particular and his attempts to ready the nation for inevitable attack.","For all the failures of naval, air and army defense, the men who died at Pearl Harbor and in the Philippines would not die in vain.","Since his inauguration in 2009, President Obama has upheld FDR's vision of America as a nation that keeps its word - a nation still committed to uphold the 'four freedoms' that President Roosevelt set down in the great Atlantic Charter of August 1941.","Looking back as an historian, I find myself having great respect for Ronald Reagan's consistency: his absolute conviction that the Soviet Union - the only competing world empire at the time - was bound to collapse!","President Ford was taken for a ride by his predecessor, whom he unpardonably pardoned; Jimmy Carter was also taken for a ride, but by his successor, Ronald Reagan, over the return of the Iran hostages.","The White House tapes, recording Nixon's nefarious doings from Watergate to the bombing of Vietnam, made frightening reading once made public on the orders of Congress.","For the serious biographer, history and the life story of a real individual are inseparably intertwined. Get the facts wrong, or distort them, and the life story gets distorted: becomes fiction.","Some of the History Channel's documentaries involve docudrama segments and are highly speculative - but there seems, on the part of the producers, to be a real determination to get at the history behind our past - not the sex, which is left to drama shows and entertainment channels.","I'm not promising to write 'JFK 2' - but one day, I might!","It must have been the fall of 1952 when my father returned to London sporting a neck tie emblazoned with the words 'I Like Ike.'","My father had left school at 18, without enough money to go to college - and, with four sons after the war, said he could still not afford to do so.","Dwight D. Eisenhower, in my judgment, will go down in history as one of the four 'great' presidents since the U.S. reluctantly became an empire in World War II; Richard Nixon as the nearest to a sociopath by the time he was compelled to resign.","Bad reviews are the bane of an author's post-publication existence.","In daring to re-tell the stories of the last twelve American presidents, both public and private, I knew I would incur some outrage with 'American Caesars.'","President Gerald Ford was no intellectual, but he had served with distinction in combat as a naval gunnery officer and then as Congressman for a quarter century.","Bill Clinton beat Bush's father, President George H.W. Bush, for the White House in 1992 by focusing on 'the economy, stupid' - and Clinton's victory led, in time, to the longest sustained boom in American history.","To be sure, administrations since Ronald Reagan had gone out of their way to massage and 'spin' news to the president's advantage, while the media did its best to un-spin it.","I've never really understood the term 'Post-Impressionism' as more than a label for Cezanne, Gauguin and van Gogh.","What George W. Bush learned in his pre-presidential years - and what he omits in his new memoirs - was not how to lead a nation, but how, with sufficient toughness, to cheat the democratic system to get elected.","I was an 18-year-old kid, and I was in the heart of things in Washington. My interest in American politics and, particularly, the Kennedys, began then.","After university, I taught secondary school for a while and opened a bookshop in Greenwich, just east of London.","Regularly, customers asked for a book on Greenwich, and there was none. After all, Elizabeth I was born there. The Observatory is known all over the world; the Royal Naval College is there. So I decided to do it.","I'm fascinated by the concept of what I call 'clusters of creativity': the Brontes, the Waughs, families with several geniuses. I'm one of four; competition among siblings has to be a factor.","Both JFK and George W. Bush were the sons of wealthy U.S. ambassadors and thus privileged to meet distinguished figures, to travel, and to see the world and think about its problems if they chose.","Selective memory is surely one of nature's most effective ways of ensuring the survival of our species.","Biography is, simply, the orphan of academia.","I belong to the Boston Biographers Group - and get my monthly 'fix' from them. Where else can I sit down for two hours with people who understand the challenge I face, daily, as a life-chronicler?","I am all for charity in judging the men who have occupied the Oval Office over the past seventy years, given the huge responsibilities the president carries across the world."],"Nigel Kennedy":["If you're playing within your capability, what's the point? If you're not pushing your own technique to its own limits with the risk that it might just crumble at any moment, then you're not really doing your job.","I'm always improving and I want to get better and never hit a plateau. I find it an amazing adventure.","I hate complacency. I play every gig as if it could be my last, then I enjoy it more than ever.","Why would you want to stand there waving a stick when you could be playing an instrument?","I see it as my job to try to keep Bach in the mainstream and present his music with, rather than without, its emotional core.","Menuhin was playing Bach on a fantastic spiritual level when he was a teenager.","You can't learn pathos or profundity.","Bach was a top harmonist geezer, which is why the jazz cats love him.","If you do the same thing every night, that's the death of music.","Yes, I mean like you know, having studied with Yehudi Menuhin that is like some direct route into Bach, because he was one of the foremost interpreters of Bach for the violin.","I think Bach is equally a romantic composer because he laid the seeds harmonically for people like Chopin and the great Romantics, Brahms, so it's difficult to you know all this like labelling and putting - I think Bach is attractive to musicians because he supersedes the labels.","If you're not pushing your own technique to its own limits with the risk that it might just crumble at any moment, then you're not really doing your job.","Even if you're playing Brahms or a Beethoven concerto, you've got to have a different vantage point, slightly, each time.","Maybe it's egocentric or whatever, but when I'm playing Beethoven, Bach, Hendrix, or whoever it is, in the end, it just feels like my own music and I'm making it up as I'm going along.","I've learnt new scales through playing different types of music, like Indian raga scales, gipsy scales and harmonically-based jazz scales.","I can think and play stuff in classical music that possibly violinists who didn't have access to other types of music could never do. It means I'm more flexible within classical music, to be a servant to the composer.","The Four Seasons was making me popular in Britain, but EMI America had no interest in making that happen in the States, so I just had a classical career there."],"Nigel Kneale":["Big Brother sounded like a silly stunt and that's what it is.","The trick is the paradox - turning your story inside out. Now if it is something that appears to be of total normality and then suddenly turns inside out and is a different thing all together then that's fun to write.","All stories should have some honesty and truth in them, otherwise you're just playing about.","I don't judge other people's work and I don't see enough of it either.","I made a rule for myself that the only television things I would do would be my own stories.","I never really saw myself as writing science fiction anyway.","I reckon I closed down at least two films companies, one of which was in Ealing in the mid 1950s.","I wanted to write a story that demanded the viewer's attention.","I'd never seen any television before I started.","I'm in my 80s and not a keen television fan.","Nothing could be recorded in those days except by aiming a movie camera at the television screen. It was at least another 10 years before they had any kind of recording medium.","People who believe in flying saucers are the scrapings from the bottom.","Something like The Haunting is not worth the slightest consideration from me.","The only folk I can judge are people like Woody Allen who I think is a genius, largely because I think he has beaten the system. He has his own company, and his films are all his own ideas. It's his direction, and so it comes out the way he imagined it.","You get to Hollywood and you are in the land of big money where they don't like to see only one screenwriter's name. It's much better if you've got four or five.","You set up a story and it turns inside out and that is, for me, the most exciting sort of story to write. The viewer thinks it's going to be about something and it does the opposite."],"Nigel Lawson":["The NHS is the closest thing the English have to a religion.","I remember when we ignored Europe and we were totally committed to the Commonwealth and the former Empire, and thought imperial preference was the only thing which enabled us to survive, that was a mistake, and it's a similar mistake to feel Britain can't be a hugely successfully country - economically and in any other way - outside the E.U.","As the resignation letter which I wrote to the Prime Minister clearly implies, it was not the outcome I sought, but it is one that I accept without rancour, despite what might be described as the hard landing involved.","I strongly suspect that there would be a positive economic advantage to the U.K. in leaving the single market.","I'm sure Mark Carney is a very clever young man, but I think that the government would be mad to move from inflation targeting to money GDP targeting.","A flat-rate poll tax would be politically unsustainable; even with a rebate scheme, the package would have an unacceptable impact on certain types of household.","We already have a sabbatical system. It's called opposition, and I've had enough of it.","To govern is to choose. To appear to be unable to choose is to appear to be unable to govern.","There is always, of course, a limit in a democracy as to what is politically possible, so you have to respect that limit. But in my experience, governments tend to be too timid.","The successful conduct of economic policy is possible only if there is - and is seen to be - full agreement between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.","Britain's destiny lies in Europe.","If our system of cabinet government is to work effectively, the prime minister of the day must appoint ministers he or she trusts and then leave them to carry out that policy.","No one, however long they have held the post, lightly gives up the great office of Chancellor of the Exchequer. Certainly I did not.","When differences of view emerge, as they are bound to do from time to time, they should be resolved privately and whenever appropriately, collectively.","I have long argued that in the modern world, corporation tax has had its day as a major source of tax revenue.","We should be forced to give so many exemptions and concessions (inevitably to the benefit of high spending authorities in Inner London) that the flat-rate poll tax would rapidly become a surrogate income tax.","One of the most important things that a Thatcher government did was change the mood of the nation to give it back its confidence.","This clutching hold of the E.U. is a sign of a lack of national self-confidence - which is not healthy.","The 'in' campaign will attempt to scare people into believing that if the U.K. were to leave, investment and jobs would move abroad. They are as wrong about that now as they were when they warned that this would happen if we did not sign up to the Euro.","The Treasury has enough trouble with forecasts even when they are trying to get them right.","One of the things that concerned me was the way the system operated: the wife who went out to work got a full personal allowance, but the wife who was working at home got nothing. This was particularly hard on wives who gave up work for a time to bring up children.","God forbid that the United Kingdom should take a lead and introduce a sensible tax system of its own which would probably comprise a very low level of corporation tax - tax on corporate profits - and perhaps a low level of corporate sales tax, because sales are where they are, and sales in this country are sales here, which we can tax here.","I have to say to the Government that you are not even getting nowhere fast - you are getting nowhere slowly.","You have got to clear up that corporation tax in the modern way has had its day as a major source of revenue, and we have got to find a new system.","However useful computer models may be, the one thing they cannot be is evidence. Computer climate models are simply conjectures.","Those who claim that to leave the E.U. would damage the City are the very same as those who in the past confidently predicted, with a classic failure of understanding, that the City would be gravely damaged if the U.K. failed to adopt the euro as its currency.","In terms of the arguments, I think the pro-Leave campaign is winning them all.","Most of the countries in the world are outside the E.U., and they are doing very nicely, thank you.","You don't need to be within the single market to trade; it's not an issue.","I am not surprised Cameron says he supports what Gillard is doing in Australia because we have, in the U.K., a totally misconceived climate change plan as well.","She felt Britain should not be so dependent on coal. She was in favour of building up nuclear energy to break the dependence on coal, and the main opposition to nuclear came from the environment movement. Mrs. Thatcher thought she could trap them with the carbon emissions argument.","Prime Minister Cameron says he wants to be the greenest government ever, but the definition of green is immature... I don't deny for a moment that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, but there are so many other factors that affect climate. It is more complicated than the computer models that we are using. What the truth is, nobody knows.","I don't think the government needs to be frightened of the banks in the slightest.","It would be wholly wrong constitutionally for the unelected House of Lords to do anything, to kill anything of a financial nature that has been through the House of Commons not once but twice.","If you punish the banks, all you are doing is reducing the banks' capital, which you want to increase, and punishing shareholders, who have done nothing wrong.","The heart of the matter is that the very nature of the European Union, and of this country's relationship with it, has fundamentally changed after the coming into being of the European monetary union and the creation of the eurozone, of which - quite rightly - we are not a part.","You do not need to be within the single market to be able to export to the European Union, as we see from the wide range of goods on our shelves every day.","Too much of British business and industry feels similarly secure in the warm embrace of the European single market and is failing to recognise that today's great export opportunities lie in the developing world, particularly in Asia.","I am delighted to accept the chairmanship of Vote Leave, to help ensure that the organisation is fully prepared for the start of the referendum campaign.","The right kind of immigrants can benefit the British economy enormously, but no country can accept indiscriminate, unlimited immigration.","The pro-E.U. campaign is all too likely to be based on a fear of the unknown because in most people's lifetime, we have never been out of the E.U.","Raising the personal allowance is massively expensive. For the same amount of money, you could look at reducing the rate of tax.","I am in favour of a fully transferable allowance.","I am not anti-European."],"Nigel Lythgoe":["I put the heart attack down to 66 cigarettes a day.","Certain formats should never be forgotten, 'Blind Date' for instance, because 'Britain's Got Talent' is really 'New Faces' or 'The Gong Show,' whilst we're basically 'Opportunity Knocks.'","It takes two to make a relationship, but only one to screw it up.","Since we launched the original 'Pop Idol' in England, I've remained close with Simon Fuller. Working as executive producer on 'American idol' for its first seven years not only was an inspirational journey into the heart of American pop culture, it opened my eyes to the untapped potential of the incredibly dynamic young people in this world.","I trained in every form of dance - started as a tap dancer when I was a kid, then contemporary, ballet, ballroom, everything. Russian, Swedish.","I think British audiences are accustomed to the 'boo' factor and pantomimes.","In my lifetime, I've discovered a great many incredibly talented individuals. Some have achieved stardom. Simultaneously, I've seen many dreams shattered, egos destroyed and lives changed forever. The end destination may well be fame and fortune, but the road to stardom is littered with broken hearts.","I've never believed that 'Idol' as a franchise is beholden to any individual because everybody said it would die the minute Simon Cowell left, and it hasn't.","So many people report to be contemporary dancers, and they're not. They are sort of jazz dancers that feel like they're throwing a bit of classical in there. I mean, a true contemporary dancer has got ballet as their base and classical ballet, and that is their base. And then they choose to extemporize on that and go into a contemporary world.","We put too much on contemporary dancers. A lot of them cannot change styles; a lot of them can't do anything else other than run around the stage reaching and stretching in anguish to somebody off camera that I never understand who it is. But it's the teenage angst they have to live with.","Tap dancers find it very difficult to do anything other than tap if that is all they have been trained in because, again, it's a whole different ballgame that you're constantly working on - bent legs, loose ankles - which you cannot afford to do when you're doing jumps or anything else.","Adam Shankman has got such love and passion for dance.","There's no question 'Amazing Race' is a beautifully produced show.","I don't go into my dentist and say, 'Are you gay?' I don't say to contestants on 'So You Think You Can Dance,' 'Are you gay?' What does it got to do with me? What does it got to do with anybody?","Everybody I've ever seen live sings out of tune, even the greatest singers in the world. And of course if you make a single nowadays, they'll autotune it anyway.","Dancing is my passion. I started as a dancer.","I nearly died with the peritonitis, but not the heart attack. The heart attack was like bad indigestion and two weeks later I was back in shouting at people. I was shouting at people during the heart attack. I had it for three days without realising what it was.","The dance community suddenly came alive with programs like 'So You Think You Can Dance,' 'America's Best Dance Crew' and 'Dancing With The Stars.'","We've had nothing but support from everybody in the dance world for a National Dance Day.","With dancing, so much is about sexuality and sensuality and without life experience it becomes much more of a performance, rather than a living, breathing entity from the soul.","And what is a stage dad, or a stage mom? It's someone who's protective. That's all.","There can always be an 'Idol' without anybody. I believe that Seacrest is probably the best host in the business.","If you don't know the right people or have the right connections, you may never be discovered. With 'Opening Act,' we are democratizing a notoriously impossible process, pulling back the curtains on a consistently fascinating industry, and affording aspiring artists the chance of a lifetime.","I don't think rap really fits in to 'American Idol' in the sense that I believe rap is an art form in itself more akin to poetry, more akin to drama, if you will.","I think rap in the street when they have rap competitions is thrilling because these kids are making it up and having a go at each other. They've got something to say. This is about getting their frustrations out.","Hip-hop is a way of life. It isn't a genre in truth in 'American Idol.'","Nicki Minaj I think is one of the best judges I've ever worked with.","'American Idol' became a juggernaut of epic proportions, but to me it was always like home.","This whole thing about, 'Take it easy, you had a heart attack, you might die,' I don't have time to take it easy. I might go at any point now. So, I want to get as much done as I can!","Since I've been in the U.S. I've lost the back of my heart, 15 ft. of intestine and my marriage - and God, I miss my intestine.","'The Hobbit' by J. R. R. Tolkien was the first book I enjoyed. I was 14 and when I finished I started it again.","I saw 'The Godfather' in London when it came out in 1972 and loved it. I've seen it probably 20 times - I always find something new.","Jon Scoffield was an incredible director and producer at ATV. I met him when I was 30 and he made great things happen in my career. He's still alive, but we're no longer in touch."],"Nigel Mansell":["I think life is full of challenges and problems. I don't believe that anyone is perfect. We all make mistakes. It's not a bed of roses, and you have to work real hard at it.","I've tried everything other than jumping out of a plane, but nothing gives you an adrenaline rush like racing a car.","Firstly the cars aren't too complicated. They have no traction control, for example, which means you can spin if you try too hard and damage your tires if you're not careful with your driving style.","Racing a thoroughbred grand prix car in front of a home crowd will be a surreal and mighty experience.","The format of the race weekend is also very well thought out. We have enough practice time to get the cars well set-up and have a proper qualifying session where we can do as many laps as we like, which is great for the drivers and spectators.","The first race is really just something that we will all need to get through. Until people see the cars in action I don't think they will understand how quick they will be, which means they are going to be tiring to drive.","I've been in motorsport my whole life since I was eight years of age.","I consider myself one of a very small handful of drivers in the world that are top drivers. The best one? I don't think anybody can say they're the best one because, from one week to the next, you can be on form or off form a little bit.","Fitness will be a major factor in the first race and I think that will play into the hands of drivers who have been racing recently, rather than people like me who haven't raced properly for a decade. I'am not one of the favourites to start with.","Everything in Formula 1 has been sterilised now, the whole thing is controlled too much.","Every GP Masters race will stand out because we will be available for fans, media and sponsors.","Alain will do everything in his power to win, he doesn't like getting beaten by anyone and least of all me.","The Masters is going to be an awesome challenge.","The preparation, commitment and desire to win will be no less than the last time I drove a grand prix car in anger."],"Nigel Rees":["My job involves searching for 'lost' quotations - that is, trying to find out who came up with a quotable saying that lingers in someone's mind and which they wish to use for their own purpose and which they cannot find in conventional dictionaries of quotation.","Euphemism in the workplace does not end with job descriptions. It reaches a pusillanimous peak at the other end of the work process - in dismissal.","You wish to put a positive construction on your deeds and words.","It is part of politics to make things look better than they really are. What is a spin doctor but a serial euphemiser?","How come there's only one Monopolies Commission?","Democracy is too good to share with just anybody.","People will say what they want to say, in the way they want to.","I was terribly shy and never said anything in class. Then I started getting into school plays. When you've got words to say, you've got a sort of armour.","I was absolutely a non-starter at games. My report for rugby said, 'Nigel's chief contribution is his presence on the field.' I used to pray for rain and sometimes it did rain - and we played anyway.","I was broadcast-struck from an early age; I had saved up for a tape recorder and started making programmes.","I got into New College, Oxford. The ethos was that you could work - or not."],"Nigel S. Wright":["I have invested at least 20 years in business and my own reputation. I'm excited to come into public service, because I think I have something to offer and to contribute. In no way will I put myself in a position of undoing what's taken 20 years to build.","My actions were intended solely to secure the repayment of funds, which I considered to be in the public interest, and I accept sole responsibility. I did not advise the prime minister of the means by which Sen. Duffy's expenses were repaid, either before or after the fact.","Public policy has been a passion of mine. For three decades, I've had some involvement in the political process.","I am very pleased to be back at Onex and am looking forward to helping build our business."],"Nigel Short":["Chess is ruthless: you've got to be prepared to kill people.","A good sacrifice is one that is not necessarily sound but leaves your opponent dazed and confused.","Surely, serious problems can't be solved just by talking about them.","Of course I'm not a racist, but I'm certainly right wing, there's no question about that.","We have a large underclass in Britain, and a fairly low standard of education. Our best universities are extremely good, but a very significant proportion of the British population that comes out of compulsory schooling with very low standards of education."],"Nigella Lawson":["I don't believe in low-fat cooking.","There is a kind of euphoria of grief, a degree of madness.","I never taste the wine first in restaurants, I just ask the waiter to pour.","The modern world is personal; people want to know intimate things.","You don't go around grieving all the time, but the grief is still there and always will be.","Emotion is messy, contradictory... and true.","Gordon Ramsay makes me laugh because he knows that I'm not a chef.","I can understand why those primitive desert people think a camera steals their soul. It is unnatural to see yourself from the outside.","Cooking is actually quite aggressive and controlling and sometimes, yes, there is an element of force-feeding going on.","But if you know that something has been really vicious, you don't read it, you don't let it into your head. What's damaging is when sentences go through your head and you burn with the injustice of it.","I know the crew so well, so I forget I'm being filmed. It's like cooking with a friend in the kitchen - you're talking, as you do, and maybe you're telling her about this wonderful way to prepare lamb chops - it's more natural, more honest.","I never have plans for the future as you never know how things will turn out.","In England and America people tend to graze all day long, but I think it's such a waste to be constantly picking at food because you then can't enjoy a proper full meal when the time comes.","I need to be frightened of things. I hate it, but I must need it, because it's what I do.","There is something wrong about being photographed that has nothing to do with vanity.","There is a vast difference between how things seem from the outside and how they feel on the inside.","It sounds like something on a very trite T-shirt, but life is what happens.","I think maybe when you live with someone who is really very ill for a long time, it somehow gives you more of a greedy appetite for life and maybe, yes, you are less measured in your behaviour than you would otherwise be.","And, in a funny way, each death is different and you mourn each death differently and each death brings back the death you mourned earlier and you get into a bit of a pile-up.","I'm not someone who's endlessly patient and wonderful.","In fact I am quite snappy and irritable, and I don't know if I'd like to make myself worse in that respect.","At some stages of your life you will deal with things and at others you are overwhelmed with misery and anxiety.","You need a balance in life between dealing with what's going on inside and not being so absorbed in yourself that it takes over.","I am not sure about facelifts because I wouldn't want to be someone who just looks like she's had a facelift.","Anyway, what makes people look youthful is the quality of their skin and I don't think you can change that.","On the whole, I prefer Christmas as an adult than I did as a child.","I was a quiet teenager, introverted, full of angst.","I wasn't good with authority, went to lots of schools, didn't like the fact that there was no autonomy.","People who have fabulous childhoods have this sense that nothing is ever going to be that good again. With me, I have the sense that nothing is going to be that bad.","Also, in a funny way, if you have been happily married there are no unresolved areas, nothing to prove to yourself after the other dies.","'Statistically, people who have been happily married and then widowed tend to remarry.","Then again, they're not scripted and I feel it's virtually impossible to be anything but yourself when you're in front of the cameras and cooking so there is a measure of truth in what you see.","I don't like conflict."],"Niger Innis":["The purposeful restriction of knowledge has been at the heart of untold misery and hardship in this world. Serfs were kept illiterate so as to not jeopardize the feudal system. Slaves were kept in the dark on a variety of subjects so as to not provide them the possibility of escape.","Understanding the long, sordid history of gun control in America is key to understanding the dangers of disarming.","After the Civil War, when blacks fought along whites to secure freedom for all, southern states enacted Black Codes, laws that restricted the civil rights and liberties of blacks. Central to the enforcement of these laws were the stiff penalties for blacks possessing firearms.","Long before gun control was touted as 'common sense' measures, the concept was promoted as a means to keep ethnic populations in an unequal position while assuaging the fears of whites.","For black Americans, we know that gun control... sprouts from racist soil - be it after the or during the infamous Dred Scott case where black man's humanity was not recognized.","There are compelling reasons to implement a true America First immigration plan, starting with border security. We are a land of immigrants. Immigration, with assimilation, has generally been good for America.","One of the crises that we have to deal with is a crisis of law enforcement officials that are not physically capable enough to handle without taking out the gun.","The slaves had food stamps, too. It was called 'scraps from Massa's table.'","People are familiar with 'the stick' of the Tea Party... challenging incumbents, flooding the phone lines. What they're not so much familiar with, and what I want to expand, is 'the carrot.' So when a Mitch McConnell, or when a Republican caucus stands firm... we have to reward them.","There is a genocide that is taking place among black men, in particular young black men, but it is not a genocide being perpetuated by white cops, by the Nazis, or by the Klan. Unfortunately and tragically, it is being perpetuated by other young black men.","Obamanomics, his imposition of European-style socialism, is not working for African-Americans. It is not working for Latinos and African-Americans.","Join America taught English, an understanding of the U.S. Constitution, that the Bill of Rights is the ultimate insurance policy for a citizen, and that being a citizen is not an entitlement. And we also taught a bit of capitalism.","I was Tea Party years before there was an official Tea Party.","One thing Republican leaders, regardless of whether they love us or they hate us, have got to understand is there's no way in hell there will ever be another Republican president without the active engagement of the Tea Party masses and support of the Tea Party masses.","We must stop trying to protect our planet from every imaginable, exaggerated or imaginary risk. And we must stop trying to protect it on the backs, and the graves, of the nation's and world's most powerless and impoverished people.","I don't give a darn about coal or about oil. I do give a darn about oil jobs. I do give a darn about the jobs that coal can bring... I am against the Obama administration demonizing certain forms of energy and glorying others. I say, bring it all in.","I know within my organization, within the grassroots of my organization of the Tea Party movement generally, there's going to be a big drive for impeaching Obama. I don't know if that's the right move... We need to play our cards very carefully and beware of the mouse trap that Obama might be trying to set for us.","When you take out individual initiative, individual responsibility, and the hope that every individual is born with, to better their lives, to climb the economic ladder, to pursue happiness, that is, in fact, a neoslavery.","I think others may look at the uniqueness of my candidacy, the fact that I'm an African-American, conservative tea party Republican, and somehow race injects itself into the conversation.","I do not believe that Darren Wilson should've been charged, but Brown should not have lost his life. Brown and Trayvon Martin should've gotten their butts kicked badly. They should've been handled physically, but they should not have been killed.","The First Amendment allows Nazis and white extremists to do what they are going to do, and it allows for black extremists and all other types of extremists to do what they are going to do.

It's full of people who have never grown up.","I love Neil Finn. I've loved everything he's done since Split Enz.","There's always some promoter having an '80s night, saying, We'll supply the band. All you can drink.","I can understand why those bands do it. It can be a hell of a lot of bloody fun. People are allowed to have a bit of fun after the age of 40, and a lot of them do need the money.","I might have to go on breakfast TV, which would mean getting up early.","There is a major turning point in life when you have to decide: shall I grow old gracefully or shall I try everything to stem the tide? For me, that point came in 2001, when I stopped dyeing my hair.","Glasgow is less polite than Edinburgh but that's a good thing - they keep it very real."],"Nik Wallenda":["It's Niagara Falls. It's one of the most beautiful natural wonders in the world. Who wouldn't want to walk across it?","I feel like I'm on cloud nine right now.","I hope what I do and what I just did inspires people around the world to reach for the skies.","I'm facing Niagara Falls - the wind and the mist and the dark and the peregrine falcons - and I'm going to stay focused on the other side.","One of the things I enjoy is the challenge of Mother Nature.","That mist was thick. It was hard to see at times. The wind was wild. It'd come at me one way and hit me from the front, and hit me from the back.","I do everything I do to pay tribute to my great-grandfather.","I have permits to be the first person in the world to walk across the Grand Canyon so that's a process we'll start working on. I'd say within three to five years I'll accomplish that as well.","I'm often very relaxed when I'm on the wire. There may be some tears because this is a dream of mine.","The mist was so challenging and the winds hit me, definitely more than I expected. It was definitely those winds, you can't re-enact them, you can't recreate them. Then my forearms started to tense up and you feel like running.","The impossible is not quite impossible if you put your mind to it.","I'd love to come to Australia. I'd love to walk about the Sydney Opera House.","There was no way to focus on the movement of the cable. If I looked down at the cable there was water moving everywhere. And if I looked up there was heavy mist blowing in front of my face. So it was a very unique, a weird sensation.","I am so blessed. How blessed I am to have the life that I have.","This is something no one in the world has ever done.","I've trained all my life not to be distracted by distractions.","I was not scared at all.","I started walking a wire when I was 2 years old, and this has been a dream of mine to recreate this walk.","I've seen the video played over and over, and it replays in my head constantly. To be able to walk in his exact footsteps is an extremely huge honor, and I did this for him as much as I did it for my family to get some closure too.","My great-grandfather, Karl Wallenda, was my biggest hero in life, my biggest inspiration behind everything I do.","We train very hard under windy conditions. I've actually walked a wire in my backyard with 90-mile-an-hour winds.","To do this walk, I believe it's around 2,000 feet, to go from the U.S. to Canada. I would train walking a wire almost 8,000 feet, to overtrain for this.","One thing that I pride myself on is, everything that I do is completely legit. We go through every channel, and do it the proper way.","If you take suede leather and put it on a piece of steel, and put moisture on it, it actually sticks.","Every walk that I do, there's obstacles in the way. There's always somebody or something that comes across negative, but I live for that sort of thing.","One thing that was passed on from generation to generation in my family, over seven generations in 200 years, was never give up. That's the way we live.","It's about carrying on the legacy and doing something I love and have a passion for.","A lot of praying helped me a lot.","What I'm doing is a natural wonder. If not, there'd be 150 people behind me on the wire.","If you think you can fall, you're more likely to.","I have never in my life walked with a harness. The weight of the tether, makes it feel like I'm dragging an anchor behind me.","I'm one of those people who always tries to overachieve. I want to do more. I want to do bigger things."],"Niki Lauda":["Giving up is something a Lauda doesn't do.","Vienna is the gate to Eastern Europe.","Airlines go in the long run at the competition to reason. For the passenger the competition is good, because each competitor tries to undercut the other one.","The crucial point is always the own cost structure. Therefore I created a Low Cost alliance with air Berlin.","Running an airline is a normal job. Racing is more.","I always go extreme ways.","We now fly with an airbus, which has 210 seats, six times the week to Palma to the spider of the air Berlin.","This aircraft tops everything. All the others look old as compared to this one.","The guest gets at least as much service with us as with some established airline, if not even more. And at by far a favourable price. Thus the passengers remain gladly with us.","The alliance with air Berlin is attractive for me. I can use the whole sales network of the air Berlin and 24 percent of my own airline at air Berlin sold.","In Germany air became generally accepted Berlin in this area. It operated with 45 airplanes within the Low Cost range from Germany, and is one the most successful carriers in Europe.","I want to bring passengers on my airplanes to present to them my product.","I employ 20 people in Vienna. The other 130 coworkers are pilots and flight companions. The Overhead is limited with me. Reduces naturally the costs of my fliers."],"Niki Taylor":["Stick to the basics, hold on to your family and friends - they will never go out of fashion.","I always hated my mole growing up. I even thought about having it removed. At the time I didn't do it because I thought it would hurt, and now I'm glad I didn't.","I owe my life to blood donors. I'm forever grateful to people who donate.","I always think about which blood drive was going on in Georgia that day when that husband or mom or school teacher rolled up their sleeve and actually gave me a second chance at life. It's the ultimate gift of life, and I'm the one who was on the other end.","My greatest life lesson has been that life can change in a second. This is why it's important to always live your best possible life and to do what you can for others.","I'm someone who likes to keep busy, especially with projects that I find meaningful and fulfilling.","I try to live by the rule do what makes you happy.","All my Doctor's said I should become a model.","I think I have enough tattoos for now. If I get any others, I'll probably do my kids initials.","With Ciel and with Rex, I said 'no epidural.' I recovered, I was walking right after I had them, just did a lot of praying all through my pregnancy that they would be healthy and my deliveries would go without a problem. I was really blessed.","I think God's really blessed me with patience. I'm good with a lot of things going on at once.","Health is very important to me.","My goal is to spread the word about the need for more blood donors."],"Niki Tsongas":["We should not be making near-term decisions with long-term consequences without robustly debating these questions and fully considering the substantial and unpredictable risks of these actions.","I was an officer in my student council.","There are wives who are very involved with their husbands' offices and really take their responsibility seriously in terms of issues and things like that. I was never very comfortable with being part of that.","People say, 'What if your name was Niki Smith?' Well, if Niki Smith lived the life I've lived, it would have great bearing.","Clearly-drawn front lines have become a thing of the past due to complex locations with ubiquitous enemy threats.","Constant and pervasive danger makes agile movement a high priority for all soldiers, whether they are assigned directly to combat or not.","Lightened body armor, which the military has made progress on, would mean increased safety and reduced risk for soldiers like the sergeant and the colonel.","Body armor is meant to fit snug to the body to stop shrapnel and absorb a bullet's impact. Armor designed for a boxier male frame does not fit properly on the overwhelming majority of females, who have a very different stature and body type than their male counterparts."],"Niki de St. Phalle":["Painting calmed the chaos that shook my soul.","It's my destiny to make a place where people can come and be happy: a garden of joy.","I could do whatever I wanted, whether people liked it or not.","I wanted to make some of the really important things of my generation and some of the biggest.","I resemble the father I once hated.","Father's ideals became part of me and still are today. His reserve, deeply rooted liberal views, his provocative humour, his passion for work and love of risk are also mine.","The world has been experiencing a whole pattern of auto-destruction, whether in environmental disasters like Chernobyl or health disasters like AIDS.","Since the age of 11, I have loved writing poems and fragments from my life.","Most people don't see the edginess in my work. They think it's all fantasy and whimsy.","AIDS is a complex situation that's sure to bring out the best and the worst in people.","With long skirts, you can really buff.

What kind of a daydream is that?","Whether you like it or not, history is on our side. We will bury you!","Support by United States rulers is rather in the nature of the support that the rope gives to a hanged man.","Even now we feel that Stalin was devoted to Communism, he was a Marxist, this cannot and should not be denied.","The more bombers, the less room for doves of peace.","The press is our chief ideological weapon.","Economics is a subject that does not greatly respect one's wishes.","I once said, 'We will bury you,' and I got into trouble with it. Of course we will not bury you with a shovel. Your own working class will bury you.","If you start throwing hedgehogs under me, I shall throw a couple of porcupines under you.","Call it what you will, incentives are what get people to work harder.","If you live among dogs, keep a stick. After all, this is what a hound has teeth for-to bite when he feels like it!","All the sparrows on the rooftops are crying about the fact that the most imperialist nation that is supporting the colonial regime in the colonies is the United States of America.","If you cannot catch a bird of paradise, better take a wet hen.","Bombs do not choose.

She's taught me how to balance everything out.","When you're succeeding, and you're doing something right... As I've got haters, I know I'm doing something right.","I'm the Princess of The Authority.","My first nephew, he couldn't say Auntie Nicole, so he called me Coco. So ever since then, everyone's called me 'Coco.'","When you've got curves - you need to show them, and I love showing mine!","I like the definition in someone's shoulders and arms. It's beautiful.","We're here in this women's revolution - we're in this women's empowerment movement worldwide - and, if anything, women should stick up for each other and be like, 'No, she deserves everything she has, and she's worked hard as a woman.'","Believing in yourself and having confidence gives you outer strength.","The one thing I've said before, the one thing that I've been taught is that when you fall, you get right back up. And I'm up.","When I leave this world, I don't want to leave just having a well-known name but having made a difference.","My nana is elegant, classy, and the most amazing woman that has ever walked this earth.","I think any time you hear that you're about to paralyze yourself, or even worse, it's just scary because you start to realize how precious life is.","You could have given me, like, Backlash, but WrestleMania, I get to tag with the love of my life, like, a memory we're going to have forever? It's been incredible.","Because my man is handsome and successful, that makes me a gold digger? First of all, I pay my own bills, and I still pay my own bills. But if your man is gonna give you a gift, you're gonna accept it. I'm not gonna be like, 'No, can you please take back the Louis Vuitton purse?' Absolutely not.","I used to love wrestling Beth Phoenix, and I loved everything Beth Phoenix did in the ring because it was like, 'Goodness. That beautiful woman is so strong.'","To me, nothing is more fun than being in that ring. That ring is just my heart; it's my passion.","I truly feel like I'm a living Wonder Woman.","To me, it's disheartening when you have someone take away everything you've done as a woman because of a man.","I am with a very successful man, and the crazy thing is people think that it makes my career easier.","Support systems and support groups are so important because that's what makes you stronger.","Women are taking the main stage. They are center stage, and they're setting all these records and making history, and I want I be a part of that. I've worked so hard to be a part of that.","I'm a pleaser, but it's not a good thing because you forget about pleasing yourself at the end of the day.","It's crazy what can happen in a decade and how much you can grow as a person and as a woman and truly find your voice.","I want to be challenged every week; I want to know that my title is on the line, and I have to fight to keep it.","I do not want my man to be exhausted for our wedding day, especially our wedding night.","I'm so proud to be a Latina. Growing up and being Latina and growing up with my father and getting to do a lot of the Hispanic traditions, I loved it.","There is so much I want to do in this world, and you only live this one life, and it goes by so fast. So I totally love to take up every second of the day doing what I love, being focused and driven and taking on a new opportunity or venture, or making sure the ones I already have are going to be the best ever.","I want to build a legacy at the WWE, but I definitely want to continue to grow the Bella Empire. I want it to go beyond the ring. I would love to be a motivational speaker.","You can't just be anyone who is off the streets and come do what we do. You have to train, and there has to be something within you. You have to have athletic ability... What we do is 100 percent athletic. I feel like it's one of the top athletic programs out there when you consider professional sports.","My goal is to have the best Divas reign in Divas history.","WWE is my home, and I will always stay with the WWE in some part, whether it's an ambassador, or maybe one day you'll see Nikki Bella as a GM, and no one can touch me.","Do I understand that I'm in a man's industry? 100%.","I've been an athlete and competitor my whole life, and there's nothing more that I get off on than competition.","I want to get in there and wrestle my sister! That's the fun part, when you get in there with someone who has the same passion for wrestling and that can work well, and you can put on a good match where you can really just get at each other.","I always had this perception that when you lift weights, you're going to get bulky and thick. I didn't realize you actually burn a lot of fat and that it trims you down.","There is nothing better than working out with your loved one.","There's something sexy about a man or a woman when they have definition in their shoulders and their arms. When I'm at a restaurant, whether it's a man in a sleeveless top or a woman, I can't help but look.","I think the best time to approach a woman is actually after her workout. When you're working out, you're playing your jam, you're in the groove, and you don't want to be interrupted. So guys, wait until she's done getting her sweat on.","Naturally, Brie and I bicker, like, every 10 minutes about everything in life.","I truly enjoyed my pay-per-view match against Brie. We have a bond that you just can't create. We're born with it, and we had this magic in the ring.","Lifting is what's made me stronger and made me look better. Not only does it burn fat amazingly - and I think it's really honed my body - it's also given me the strength in the ring to lift girls up. I can literally lift anything on my shoulders.","Being a Diva is not easy. We are on the road 300 days a year. We don't get a lot of family or personal time. With 'Total Divas' on top of that, on our days off, we have the cameras following us, and that's not for everyone.","For Brie and I - we were just 'model tired.' I was told to get a boob job; I was told to lose weight. Brie and I had a big struggle... Brie and I legit hopped in our cars, went to Georgia, jumped in a ring, and said, 'Hey, you're going to sign us. We want to be here.' I know everyone thinks it was really easy for us, but it wasn't.","I'm very easy to impersonate. From the look to the personality, I'm like, wow.","I'm like, 'John, people treat me differently because they just look at me as a girlfriend,' and unfortunately, that's our world. Now all of a sudden - just within hours of him putting a ring on it and asking me to be his wife - it is crazy the level of respect people have for me.","Reality TV is a lot about drama, but for the first time in a long time, you actually have role models on TV.","My idol was Jennifer Lopez.","I was maturing in a way that all my friends weren't. How is it that I'm 10, and I look 15, and all my friends don't?","Now, actually, I can prove the people that I'm an individual; I just don't have to be a Bella Twin to make a name for myself here. I can be Nikki Bella, Fearless Nikki, and I've really enjoyed that.","I'm so proud, from the food to the women to the curves. I just need to learn a little more espanol.","For me, nothing is off limits.","I have a slight herniation above where I had surgery.","Do I want to walk the rest of my life? Do I want to not be in pain? It just sucks because I have this true battle going on in my head, and everyone keeps telling me you gotta put your health first, but there's so much of me that wants to put my career first.","If I didn't have competition and I didn't have people trying to take my spot, then it can make someone lazy. So it does the exact opposite. It motivates me.","I will admit, the dominatrix look has won me over!","I can't tell you how proud I am of all the Total Divas and just how excited I am about how well the show is doing.","We fell in love with wrestling, and then we really wanted to break barriers, and we now get to do that because that's evolved beyond the ring.","I never would have thought, when I was 23 and first stepped foot in that ring, that it would give me a platform to use my voice.","It makes me feel young. Dancing just gives you youth. You can get lost in these moments where the day just seems better. There's something very freeing about dancing, and I love that.","To film with our family is awesome - you have to hang out with each other, and I love that because I hate being alone.","I love being on 'Smackdown.' I feel like there is so much more opportunity, and we get to tell such fun, interesting stories. Everyone wants to work together to create gold - it's the best locker room I have ever been in throughout my whole career.","Everyone used to tell me, 'Just so you know, Divas only last five years around here.' I said, 'What? I want to be here forever!'","When we started training with WWE, coaches were impressed and asked if we had had boxing training. I said no, it was all soccer. As a defender, I had to learn to stay on my feet, track backwards, and I feel all the movement I do in the ring was helped by my soccer background.","Any female of any age, anyone sitting on that couch, is going to relate to some Bella family member.","I didn't want to come back and be mediocre; I wanted to hang in with the girls, and I wanted to prove myself every week.","I do talk pretty valley. I totally have this look, and I'm so in love with my man, he makes me talk in a weird voice, and you can just make fun of me easy.","I'm not just muscles and headlocks. I need to prove to people that there is an elegant woman in here.","I love playing bad.","You watch someone, and you see how they are, and sometimes you can use that against them.","When someone thinks they're good at something, you can use it against them, and that's what we did. We did the kiss of death.","I'm really excited to get my Herve Leger, my Louboutins, and to be rocking the red carpet. I don't know if Hollywood can handle it, but I'm ready to bring it.","I can't tell you how many guys have approached me when I'm doing cardio. Like, I have my headphones on; I'm in the zone, so don't bother me.","I remember walking home one day from school, and this car pulled up behind me really slow, and it gave me a really weird feeling, and all of a sudden it skimmed me, and the man was half naked and tried to pull me into his car and saying crazy things to me. And it was terrifying.","I think my mom is kind of this way, too. We're just such strong women. My mom's been through so much, so I think that's where I got it from.","I know that with my spinal condition I can never be full time again - I just can't do that, but I do wanna be full time, and I don't want to retire.","Even though a lot of people keep trying to get me to retire, I won't.","I am so excited to be an aunt.","The Authority has the power to turn everyone against me, and they have.","That's all I can be is fearless.","When you have such a love and passion for wrestling and you love to work, you want to get in with good workers.","I want challenges. I want to compete. I don't want it to always be easy. I don't want it to always just be a few of us girls. I want there to be competition.","I'm definitely willing to film it for sure. I feel like I've taken people on this incredible journey on 'Total Divas' and 'Total Bellas.' They have seen me cry, get angry, and be so many different ways about marriage. I feel like for my fan base, my Bella Army, I should let them tune in to my wedding.","It truly feels like all my blood, sweat, and tears have paid off, and you're just excited to be a woman because you're getting just as much time as the men, and you're getting the recognition.","We started to have more women and little girls in our audience, where it started to be 40 percent female that sat in our live audience. So I think, when that was happening and the women were stepping up and saying, 'Hey we can do what the men do,' and then you saw it on a reality show, it was just inevitable for us to have this women's evolution.","I think just living in the day and age of technology, whether you're a celebrity or a normal human being, you're always worried about your privacy. And I think as long as you behave, you know you're OK. I think anyone worries about that.","I was loving being the champion, and I wasn't listening to my body. I almost felt like I was untouchable in a way - that I could just keep going and everything would be OK.","I do everything in moderation and count everything... that includes my wine.","I was going through puberty and was much curvier than other girls, which made me insecure. Then I saw J. Lo on the cover of 'Latina' magazine, and she embraced those curves and was proud of who she was.","I see traits of my body in my mother and grandmother, and it makes me proud. This shape isn't going anywhere.","When I saw Kate Moss's champagne tower from her wedding, I was like, 'Okay, check - I want that. I want fireworks.'","That wrestling ring is home for me; it's my passion. I love what I do.","There's nothing like performing in front of a live crowd and just having people literally react to whatever it is you do, and there's nothing better than when you get that connection with the audience.","It shocks me, the rumors people start: that I have the title because of my boyfriend. If that was the case, I would have gotten the title when I came back years ago and still had the title. He has nothing to do with it.","If we can continue to tell stories where fans don't know what will happen next, I think that will be a plus in this 'Divas Revolution.'"],"Nikki Blonsky":["I just want girls to realize, everybody's born a way for a reason, and you are who you are. You should just be yourself at all times. The only way you're going to get through life, happily, is being yourself.","I grew up singing since the age of three. Vocally trained since the age of eight. Fascinated by Mary Poppins and all those musical movies and really knew that I wanted to be a performer.","I pray that there will be more roles for bigger girls. I pray that the role of the love interest, the beautiful, sexy girl, will be played by a plus-size woman.","If you can look in the mirror every day and feel comfortable, then you're healthy.","Patsy Cline is my favorite singer in the entire world - she is my idol. I adore her.","Michael Clarke Duncan and I met at a music festival that was honoring films, and we happened to be seated next to each other at the dinner, and we just hit it off and kept in touch ever since. He was just the gentle giant in real life like you would have expected him to be.","I remember seeing 'Hairspray' when I was 15, and it is such a luxury to be able to see a Broadway show, and it is so hard to do if you don't live in New York - plus, it can be expensive to go to the theatre all the time, too.","I would be willing to do any role Duncan Sheik asked me to play."],"Nikki Cox":["I'm a McDonald's girl - several times a week. Usually the two-cheeseburger combo meal.","Acting is the only thing I ever really wanted to do, and I'm really ill-prepared to do anything else.","Filming scenes like that are always odd but I feel comfortable with Josh and care about him a great deal, so it could be much worse. Scenes like that are just part of the job.","I still don't know quite what I'm supposed to do or be.","I think I'm as content as one can be.","I'm probably the most introverted extrovert you'll ever meet. Up until I got this show I was constantly told, 'She was really good, but she's just not cute enough.'","If I didn't have fake nails, my fingers would be bloody stumps.","Mary and I look eerily similar but other than that, the differences are pretty much night and day.","The only other thing that interested me as a kid was being a bricklayer. So if I hadn't become an actress, I would probably be a bricklayer.","To be perfectly honest, drama is a lot simpler than comedy.","We've had some really good guest stars. But I have to go with Alec Baldwin as my favorite. He is so neat and such a movie star. He's handsome and quirky. I was in heaven the week he was on the set.","When all of a sudden, people say, 'Wow, you look nice,' and carry on, it's shocking. Really awkward.","You're asking the wrong girl about fame. I'm hardly famous. I wouldn't want to trade places with anyone else.","All that some actresses want is for people to take them seriously instead of caring about how they look.","For me, I've worked hard for people to think I'm funny.","There is just so very much I can't do. I don't drive, for one.","I learned how but I have a terrible paranoia and fear. I do not drive an automobile.","I'm pretty captivated by reality TV and I know that as an actor I probably shouldn't be saying that, but it's what I like to watch.","I've always wanted to appear in a 3-D Movie, that's always been a goal of mine. If you appear in a 3-D picture you are a shoo-in for an Oscar. There's no competition.","I'm hardly famous. I wouldn't want to trade places with anyone else.","I cannot cook to save my life. I'm really frighteningly useless, when you get down to it."],"Nikki DeLoach":["Everybody remembers what it's like to be in high school. We really never leave those years behind.","If I wasn't an actress I'd definitely want to do something in the arts and something that was very creative.","I actually have a lot of guilty pleasures.","I learned how to get rid of the Southern accent when I was, like, 11 years old and living in New York for the summer doing modeling and commercials and auditioning for Broadway. The mother I lived with for the summer taught me how to drop my Southern accent.","I've done a lot of bad TV and bad movies. I've also done some really great things."],"Nikki Giovanni":["Mistakes are a fact of life. It is the response to the error that counts.","A lot of people resist transition and therefore never allow themselves to enjoy who they are. Embrace the change, no matter what it is; once you do, you can learn about the new world you're in and take advantage of it.","Poetry and music are very good friends. Like mommies and daddies and strawberries and cream - they go together.","Now, everything I do, I do because I want to. And I believe the best is yet to come.","Follow your image as far as you can no matter how useless you think it is. Push yourself.","We love because it's the only true adventure.","If everybody became a poet the world would be much better. We would all read to each other.","Everything will change. The only question is growing up or decaying.","The catchword I use with my classes is: The authority of the writer always overcomes the skepticism of the reader.","If I could come back as anything - I'd be a bird, first, but definitely the command key is my second choice.","If now isn't a good time for the truth I don't see when we'll get to it.","I really don't think life is about the I-could-have-beens. Life is only about the I-tried-to-do. I don't mind the failure but I can't imagine that I'd forgive myself if I didn't try.","If you don't understand yourself you don't understand anybody else.","Some say we are responsible for those we love. Others know we are responsible for those who love us.","We write because we believe the human spirit cannot be tamed and should not be trained.","Art is not for the cultivated taste. It is to cultivate taste.","I am totally fascinated by people and our history as I understand and continue to explore it. People have so much to give and so far to go and yet we have given and gone a great distance. It's really just interesting to ask: why not? And see where that takes me.","There are things you stand up for because it's right.","A lot of people refuse to do things because they don't want to go naked, don't want to go without guarantee. But that's what's got to happen. You go naked until you die.","I think one of the nicest things that we created as a generation was just the fact that we could say, 'Hey, I don't like white people.'","If you know what you're talking about, or if you feel that you do, the reader will believe you.","Hip-hop is a cultural expression - it's embracing.","The poet Melvin B. Tolson once said, 'A civilization is judged only in its decline.' That made sense to me. I would imagine the same is true for poets and tennis players.","Sacred cows make very poor gladiators.","There're two people in the world that are not likeable: a master and a slave.","I had a really nice childhood; I had great parents. I earned my allowance by washing dishes, and in the summer I earned my allowance by working in daddy's garden.","Favorite poems are like favorite children. We definitely have them but we never tell as the others would have their feelings hurt.","We eat up artists like there's going to be a famine at the end.","You must invent your own games and teach us old ones how to play.","White people really deal more with God and black people with Jesus.","When you are skinning your customers, you should leave some skin on to grow again so that you can skin them again.","We believe 'Peter Rabbit' because Beatrix Potter believes it. You have to.","I am proud of the hip hop generation. They are good business people and, actually, good people.","I'm just totally fascinated by people.","I spend a lot of time learning about bird watching.","For most of my life, I've thought of myself as pretty cool.","I appreciate and enjoy my age."],"Nikki Glaser":["People are just so insensitive because they're ignorant; they don't understand, so they're scared of what they're ignorant of.","I wasn't a good-looking child. I got screwed out of the genetic deal. My sister looks like a model. I think that's why I'm a comic. I'm deeply insecure, since I was always feeling ugly. I wasn't a healthy child. I had poor self-esteem. That's why I need people's approval.","I am a woman, so I never want to hide that or be like, 'I'm one of the boys,' because I'm not. I am aware of our audience. We always aim for the right combo of not hitting people over head but still getting our message across.","The transgender bathroom thing - it's just so obvious that people are scared of what they don't understand. It's like, 'I don't want to deal with the fact that some people might have been born in the wrong body.'","Being pretty was always a very big thing growing up.","Make eye contact with cute strangers. Give guys your email. Email is safer than a number, or at least it feels that way.","My sister was very, very beautiful and I was very not. Doing comedy is the greatest thing ever because you don't have to do that, and I've since learned to let go of that.","I never feel guilty or anything after a podcast; I feel better.","We just learned about this fetish where guys just give women money and know that they are spending their money. It's not like a sugar daddy thing. It's like financial domination, or something like that. These guys just want to give you money.","I like putting myself in uncomfortable situations.","As far as how I approach the humor, I think the best comedy is going to happen when I'm myself and act organically to a news item or situation.","The best stuff - the most interesting stuff - usually happens when I allow myself to be in the moment and working from that space.","I won't tackle something like furries, because there's nothing new to say. Also, I won't do anything that I think will put my life at risk.","Why am I sharing this part of my life when it opens me up to judgment? But part of me wants to share that part of my life because I think non-monogamy is a normal thing for human beings to want.","I think people are afraid of the concept of open relationships. Like, 'I will not accept this.' They don't have to! No one is telling them to. But it might work for other people.","My standup is years and years of me working things out on the road. I'm really proud of it! A lot of it is about, well... I don't know why I feel this way, but I feel like every special or show I do is some variation on how I feel like I'm not a girl, not yet a woman.","Everything I write in my show is a collaboration with a team.","I'm learning that if you put yourself out there and make fun of yourself first, it really does work. People can't really make fun of you.","All my relatives and friends have been pretty aware of my brand of humor for a while, so none of them have been shocked.","Funny is funny. If it's funny enough to women, it will be funny to men. I think that's been proven by Broad City and Amy Schumer. They're killing it.","The more you work in this business as a comedian, the closer you get to just being yourself onstage, on camera, the more well received you are.","I remember the 'Jenny McCarthy Show' being kind of funny, and I remember her being just like one of the boys. I remember her being counter to everything I thought girls should be on TV, or whatever. I kind of liked her vibe.","Just sharing things that are either embarrassing or possibly relatable, searching for that laugh so that someone makes me feel less alone. Like, 'Oh, they laughed, so they get what I'm saying.","I've talked about my relationship without consulting my boyfriend about whether or not he wants that talked about, and I've also taken a story that has happened with us and, for comedic purposes, exaggerated it or changed it in some way that made him look not great.","I think I deal with my anger toward my relationship or about my relationship or about my friendships or my family - I deal with it on stage in a passive-aggressive way, and that can be very harmful if it gets back to them, which it always does.","Jimmy Fallon's strengths are that he's fun, and he's good at impressions, and he's musically inclined. And my strength is that I'm a joke writer, but I also have no filter, and I think that that's not a talent per se, but it's just a thing about myself that I have found that people like about what I do.","I went and hung out at a foot fetish party, and I knew that was a very popular fetish to have, but I didn't realize how amazing it would be to have it.","There's actually a thing called Wikifeet that's the Wikipedia of celebrity girls' feet.","I don't know what that is because to me, Feb. 14 is Rob Thomas' birthday, and that's only what I acknowledge it as. I just like to celebrate that as Rob Thomas' birthday.","Rob Thomas loves nothing more than for couples to go on dates, and he loves chocolates. Boxes of 20 chocolates.","I would much rather be someone with high self-esteem and less funny.","I just realized I have probably spent more time in a strip club than Rihanna has, and that is saying a lot because she goes a lot!","I had a guy on Facebook for, like, years just asking if he could PayPal me money, and of course I have to say no when, really, I'm just like, 'Why wouldn't I? He doesn't want anything for it.'","I'm in a relationship and have never been on Tinder as a single woman, but from what I have seen, I think it is always good to have a picture with an animal to show that you are kind.","I was inspired by people telling me I should be a comedian. I tried it and had a really good first set, so I was like, 'OK, I'll do this forever'.","I remember thinking years ago about getting a half special, 'When you get that, that will be it. That will be all you need to feel validated in this world.' I feel like that special was just another set.","I have to say that it's fun to write for young girls, and it's exciting to know that we're influencing them and they're looking at us like, 'I want to grow up and be like them.' I mean, I just made up the person saying that.","I'm so glad I'm not in college anymore. I'm so glad I'm not having kids.","I just got a new dog, so I was worried that he'd hate the fireworks, and he did, but just because he's not a patriot, not because of the loud sounds. The loud sounds he's fine with - he just hates America.","If anyone's going to bring about mass extinction, it'll be Donald Trump.","Up until recently, I've said, 'I don't notice the sexism in the industry.'","As a female comic, if you talk about sex in any capacity, you will be branded a 'sex comic,' so I might as well go full force on it.","Things end in this business. Shows get canceled, or you walk away from them - but most likely, things get canceled.","I've been saying inappropriate things since I was a kid.","I just want to open people's eyes to different things.","I was lucky enough to find stand-up really early in life. And I'm so grateful that I did, because the second I found it, I was like, 'I know what I want to do'.","It strikes me as pretty interesting and cool how girls support each other in this business. I've never felt so much support in my life than from my fellow female comedians. I attribute much of my success to some of them.","Nothing really shocks me anymore.","All my life - middle school, high school - I've always been worried what are people going to think.","When I did 'Nikki and Sara Live,' I think a lot of the comedy got lost because we were always so worried about how we looked, and so was the network.","A lot of being a woman in this business is about how you look... That's not why we're even in this business; that's not what people want from us. We're valuable because we're funny and because we have a voice and a point of view.","I'm sure I've already made some mistakes that I'll wish I could take back.","I knew what I wanted to do, so I was constantly working on material once I got to KU.","A college degree was very important for them; it wasn't for me. So I picked English because I'm fluent. I thought it would be the easiest to do.","College is good discipline. That's what I learned there: pull an all-nighter, get it done, and get an A. I'm the biggest procrastinator, and I learned how to be an efficient procrastinator.","I'm not a bleeding-heart feminist, but I do like to call out that stuff in my act. It's nice when you find a perspective that no one has hit on.","I started out splitting my time between the Kansas City and St. Louis comedy scenes, which both had bluer sensibilities than other cities that I've worked.","The first place I ever performed was at CU Boulder. I went there my freshman year and discovered stand-up after my friends talked me into signing up for a showcase on campus.","I love what I do, but living in one place for an entire year and not being on the road constantly was glorious. The road lifestyle is not ideal for a woman who's about to be thirty.","I don't feel the same pressure to be perfect up there that I did in the beginning.","I always told my parents, 'Just give me till I'm 27 to do comedy, to make it'.","My boyfriend and I are not good at fighting. We're better than we were when we started dating - two breakups and three years ago - but it's never come naturally to either of us. I have often wished we fought like I imagine Pink and Carey Hart fight.","My logic used to be if I get angry at my boyfriend, he could say, 'Well, if that thing I do that I don't want to stop doing makes you mad, I don't need to be with you. Bye!' And then he'd leave me. Forever.","I have always been scared of confrontation. My therapist says it stems from my fear of abandonment.","My boyfriend and I have finally learned how to embrace confrontation as something that will only help us as a couple.","Sarah Silverman. She's the reason I do comedy. Her DNC speech was my favorite thing I ever heard. Sitting down with her and laughing would be incredible.","I was going to go to a Gathering of the Juggalos but decided that wouldn't work. They would know I was there to make fun of them. It would be like me going to a Trump rally.","I like guys with a sense of humor who smile a lot and are kind.","That's the compliment I get most often - 'You guys are so honest.'","Some of my favorites include 'Walking the Room' and 'Never Not Funny' and 'FitzDog Radio', Greg Fitzsimmons' podcast.","I've been doing stand-up for a few years, and I have a handful of fans just from stuff I've done, like 'Last Comic Standing.' And as a fan of stand-ups myself ... like, when I first discovered Sarah Silverman, I wanted to know everything about her life.","I nannied for a couple of months. The kids were super-funny; it made me wish I grew up in a comedy household. But nannying is demoralizing. I'm just not cut out for it.","Temping is the worst. I would rather starve and be homeless than nanny or temp again.","Someone told me I looked like a young Tonya Harding recently, as if 'young' would soften the blow."],"Nikki Grimes":["Something about your life always makes its way into your stories. That's just the nature of the beast.","In one sense, the stories I read betrayed me. Too few gave me back my mirror image. Fewer still spoke to, or acknowledged, the existence of the problems I faced as a black foster child from a dysfunctional and badly broken home.","I spent many hours ensconced in the local library, reading - nay, devouring - book after book after book. Books were my soul's delight.","Originally I had planned to write just a couple of children's books and then, return the focus on adult literature. A funny thing happened along the way - I kept having new ideas, and then I looked up one day, and 30 years had passed!","In 'Out of the Dark,' I'm talking about my own life. I'm not talking as a character or speaking as a character. I was not as free as when I write fiction.","It seemed uncanny that words, spread across a page just so, had the power to transport me to another time or place. But they could.","Writing is a muscle that needs to be exercised."],"Nikki Haley":["We must fix our broken immigration system. That means stopping illegal immigration. And it means welcoming properly vetted legal immigrants, regardless of their race or religion. Just like we have for centuries.","My brother and I have converted to Christianity, and my other brother and sister are still Sikh. So for me, it's not something that I ever want to be judgmental on. I know my parents are two people of a very strong faith. I respect all that they've done in raising their four kids and in the opportunities that they've given us.","Some people think that you have to be the loudest voice in the room to make a difference. That is just not true. Often, the best thing we can do is turn down the volume. When the sound is quieter, you can actually hear what someone else is saying. And that can make a world of difference.","I am the proud daughter of Indian immigrants who reminded my brothers, my sister and me every single day how blessed we were to live in this country. They loved the fact that only in America, we could be as successful as we wanted to be, and nothing would stand in our way.","I think it's very important to get ego out of the room. I think it's important to realize it takes two hands to clap - stop the pointing, stop the blame game. I think we've seen enough of that, I think the country is tired of it. I think they want to see Washington function, they want to see action.","On matters of race, South Carolina has a tough history. We all know that. Many of us have seen it in our own lives - in the lives of our parents and our grandparents. We don't need reminders.","I encourage people to find and use the power of their voices just as much when I do not agree with those voices as when I do agree with them.","Everyone can have a bad day.","It is time for all civilized nations to stop the horrors that are taking place in Syria and demand a political solution.","Everything that has happened to me in my life has defined who I am, and all of the things leading up to being governor, that all came from overcoming challenges in childhood and overcoming challenges as I got older. When you have God, you quickly understand there's nothing you can't overcome.","I wear heels, and it's not for a fashion statement - it's ammunition.","Our forefathers paved the way for us. Let's take their values and their strengths and rededicate ourselves to doing whatever it takes to keep America the greatest country in the history of man.","Today, we live in a time of threats like few others in recent memory. During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation. No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.","I'm a huge fan of women; I think we're great.","This is America. Anyone is free to protest about anything they want.","We cannot continue to allow immigrants to come here illegally. And in this age of terrorism, we must not let in refugees whose intentions cannot be determined.","Courage breeds leadership.","I'm not going to stop beating up on the Democrats for wasteful spending.","Contraception doesn't define a woman.","There is no war on women. Women are doing well. But women are thoughtful. And what we in the Republican Party and across the country, Republican, Independents and Democrat women say is we're more thoughtful than a label. We care about jobs and the economy and healthcare and education. We care about a lot of different things.","Almost forty-five years after my parents first became Americans, I stand before you and them tonight as the proud governor of the state of South Carolina.","No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country. At the same time, that does not mean we just flat out open our borders. We can't do that.","I work with the president and speak with him multiple times a week. This is a man, he didn't become the president by accident. And as much as everyone wants to talk about stability, was he unstable when he passed the tax reform? Was he unstable when we finally hit back at Syria and said no more chemical weapons?","Immigrants have been coming to our shores for generations to live the dream that is America. They wanted better for their children than for themselves. That remains the dream of all of us, and in this country, we have seen time and again that that dream is achievable.","Republicans need to stay strong on the fact that marriage is between a man and a woman. Those are values that are true to the party and true to who we are. They could focus on jobs and the economy, but we all know that keeping the family structure intact is very important in our country.","I'm a strong voice by nature. I'm sometimes a bull in a china shop.","I wear heels. It's not for a fashion statement, it's... ammunition.","Protests are fine. But in South Carolina we believe in the rule of law, and the people of this state should never doubt that as governor, I will enforce it.","My husband was adopted, and we had difficulty having both of my children, so we know the gift that life is. We do believe marriage is between a man and a woman. It's how you stand on that kind of thing or how you vote that really makes a difference.","I have no doubt that if we act with proper focus, we can protect our borders, our sovereignty, and our citizens, all while remaining true to America's noblest legacies.","God bless the people of the State of South Carolina.","I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up.","Any country needs to know that there are consequences when they get involved in our elections. And I think that's why it's good that the investigations are going on and we're analyzing and we're looking into all of that, and I think we need to manage it accordingly.","We don't see a peaceful Syria with Assad in there.","I do think that climate change is real. And I think that it's something that we have to deal with. But I also think it has to be a balance. And, you know, as governor of South Carolina, that was what I did.","I think what you can see is that we have worked very closely with China. China has really stood up in putting the pressure on North Korea.","We are now changing the culture at the United Nations. And with that, we're changing the culture in the world in the discussions that we're having.","This was not a decision made with the Israelis. This was a decision by the president for the American people. And so, it was a decision that we all said Jerusalem should be the capital and the embassy should be there. This decision should not weigh in on the peace process.","I have had the pleasure of knowing Mitt Romney for several years now. There's so much to appreciate about him. He fixes things. He's results-driven. He's taken broken companies and made them successful.","South Carolinians are strong, independently-minded people. At the end of the day, they make their own decisions. And I respect them for that. And I welcome that. And I told him that from the very beginning.","I think any label is bad. I'm more than a label.","As I said, my parents loved that when they came to America, if you worked hard, the only things that could stop you were the limits you placed on yourself.","When we come into the NSC, everybody has different opinions. At the end of the day, we present the president with all the facts. We let him make the decision. And we all, as a team, go out and support that decision.","We're going to fight hard on this. We're going to push hard - not just on North Korea; we're going to push hard on other countries who are not abiding by the resolutions and not abiding by the sanctions against North Korea.","My job is to create jobs. In the end I'm going to have jobs to show for it.","We don't have unions in South Carolina because we don't need unions in South Carolina.","I'm not going to stop beating up on the unions.","People ask the question, 'If you're offered VP, would you take it?' No, I won't take it.","I had a white senator call me a rag head, and I had an African-American legislator call me a conservative with a tan.","All of my policy is not based on a label. It's based on what I lived and what I know.","I think the media's a little frightened of women.","I think that we are at a point in our country where we're trying to decide what role should religion play in the political arena.","I don't think we should focus on what church that person walks into .. I think we need to focus on what they do when they walk out of church.","You don't go to the people that are just like you. You go to the people that you have to earn their credit.","The people of South Carolina support conservatives who are trying to push real change, and the people of South Carolina expect their presidential candidates to back them up when they show courage.","For a bill to become law, it truly has to be the will of the people, and for a president to stop the will of the people and stop what you're trying to do in your state is not the role of Washington.","I've never been a planner. I didn't know I was going to run for the State House. I didn't know I was going to run for governor. I don't know what's next, and I love not thinking about it because the doors open at a certain time.","I'm very proud of the way that I was raised, I'm very proud of the way that my parents raised me.","The public likes to think that women only care about contraception.","My parents started a business out of the living room of our home and, 30-plus years later, it was a multimillion dollar company. So, President Obama, with all due respect, don't tell me that my parents didn't build their business.","Unfortunately, these past few years, you can work hard, try to be as successful as possible, follow the rules, and President Barack Obama will do everything he can to stand in your way.","In 2009, South Carolina was blessed to welcome a great American company that chose to stay in our country to continue to do business. That company was Boeing.","Boeing started a new line for their 787 Dreamliner, creating 1,000 new jobs in South Carolina, giving our state a shot in the arm when we truly needed it.","American businesses deserve a federal government that doesn't stand in their way, not one that tries to chase them overseas.","Ann Romney makes all women proud by the way she has conducted her life as a strong woman of faith, as a mother, as a wife and as a true patriot.","Soon, the Obama presidency will end, and America will have the chance to turn in a new direction.","The foundation that has made America that last, best hope on earth hasn't gone anywhere. It still exists. It is up to us to return to it.","Growing up in the rural south, my family didn't look like our neighbors, and we didn't have much. There were times that were tough, but we had each other, and we had the opportunity to do anything, to be anything, as long as we were willing to work for it.","My parents always used to tell us not to complain about things but do something about them, so 'Can't is not an option' was almost a way of life.","I was raised by the Indian community, and those families are still very close to us. We used to go to each others' houses one Sunday a month, so we got to know everyone well. Also, we love Indian food and can't get enough of it.","Ultimately, my connection to my Indian-ness comes back to my mom and dad. They would all tell me and my siblings stories about their life in India, so it was very close to my two brothers and my sister and I.","I did read Indian scriptures when we could get the English versions, but the problem was I never took the time to learn the language. Really, what it comes down to is that I knew the emotion of faith; I knew what my parents were trying to teach me, but we always said 'No' when my mom was trying to teach us Punjabi.","I've always felt like there are certain politicians that wear their religion on their sleeve in a way that you almost feel is disingenuous. I think that your faith has to be first personal. I struggle with those people that preach something and go back behind closed doors and live differently.","I fight for the things that I care about, which are jobs and the economy. I fight for the things I think are important, which are reducing the debt and getting more companies to come to South Carolina.","The reason I actually ran for office is because of Hillary Clinton. Everybody was telling me why I shouldn't run: I was too young, I had small children, I should start at the school board level.","Government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people; it wasn't intended to be all things to all people.","The second a political consultant tries to play dirty tricks, it will backfire, and it will hurt that candidate.","I'm Nikki Haley, Governor of the great state of South Carolina."],"Nikki Reed":["Young people need to vote. They need to get out there. Every vote counts. Educate yourself too. Don't just vote. Know what you're voting for, and stand by that.","I like for jewelry to tell a story and to be able to talk about what I'm wearing. That's more important to me than a name, brand, or label.","Some of the greatest moments in life come from moments that are incomplete.","I'm just a believer in keeping all of the creative brain cells moving and working even when you're not working because the inevitable loneliness and boring drought in the actor's world, it can eat you alive.","I think we use a lot of words and labels when trying to describe people: ones with autism, ones without autism. In general, I think that labeling people is a major issue, and people don't understand the power of language.","I think my mother is my biggest influence. There are so many things I hate about her but at the same time I'm thankful for her. All I know is that when I'm a parent I want to be just like my mom. I can talk to my mom more than any of my friends could talk to their parents.","What is important is to treat everyone like an individual and learning not to generalize autism. With autism, people make assumptions, but it's very broad, and everyone's so different. You have to treat each person as an individual.","My little brother is autistic, so I would love to be involved in a charity for autism, but I haven't found the right one yet.","If I had more confidence, I would rock a crop top.","I'm really diligent; I have a really militant side of my personality that comes out in areas of work. I'm very motivated, you know?","I like a really natural looking body, so I'm not into muscles and looking like you just did 1,000 pull-ups and sit-ups and like you only eat lean turkey. That's not for me. I just like people to look like people, and so I think it's really attractive when men don't have perfect bodies.","I've never really made a big deal out of my birthday.","In middle school, we are all so damn insecure. It was the worst time for me, really destructive, like slapping myself across the face but loving it. Now I have to be an adult and change myself. I have to be a bigger person.","I feel like every day of my life is a funny wardrobe malfunction!","I grew up in a very relaxed environment in one sense, without many rules. My mother had a problem knowing where to draw the line, which caused a chaotic and hectic home life. A lot of people took advantage of my mom.","With girls, friendships are hard because you have to learn to get to a maturity level to love them but not want to be them.","I definitely think that females have a harder time. It's a lot harder to be a girl because you're always in your head. I've heard my brother go and take it out on the football as he says. Whereas girls would rather sit down and over think things.","I think so many young girls get caught up in the challenge of being with somebody who's dangerous, who's bad, who's enticing, who's all of those things, and you forget what it's like to enjoy simple love.","I have nobody. I have surrounded myself with people who are fake just because I need to talk to somebody.","At the end of the day, that's our sole purpose and our sole reason for existing, is to love somebody else.","My mom can't defend herself to the world. She is such an amazing woman, with such an open heart. It's a real hard line, and I crossed it. I took everyone's life story and assumed it would be a great thing to put on screen. I was being selfish and I feel so horrible about it. I feel so guilty.","When you date someone who loves the outdoors, it's inspiring.","I've discovered on this journey in the entertainment industry that, especially as a girl, woman... it's really important to try to create your own opportunities.","Polynesian women are known for their long hair, glowing skin, and thick nails. And that comes from the local diet, which is mostly plant based with a little bit of fish and a lot of natural fats and oils.","My older brother's really good at making fun of me for just being a workaholic and never taking time for myself. Even when we go on vacation, I'm always working.","Being an actor, you have to be working even when you're not working. You never really get to relax because anytime you're relaxing in between jobs, you're just worried that you're not going to get another job.","I love to write what I see and what I do and what I experience, and I like to see if people can relate to that. I don't know if I am as good at making up a story in my head that has no truth to it, so that is a challenge for me.","I'm animal obsessed! I basically have a farm in my house.","I never skipped a meal. I can't even recall a time when I've skipped a meal. I never understand when people say 'I'm so busy, I forgot to eat today.' It's never happened. I always find time!","'Thirteen' was really hard on my family. I wrote this movie about them and their flaws and imperfections and what it was like growing up. It was from one kid's perspective and not a well rounded one. You get older, and it's like, 'How dare I portray my father as being a totally vacant, careless schmuck?'","I feel like human beings cover up their scent with all these different things and products. I feel like we've given up our ability to engage with people because we don't know how people smell anymore.","Part of being young is making mistakes.","We live in a world where sort of nothing is shocking anymore.","I've always loved music and felt connected to it, but was too afraid to explore that avenue.","Having people wait outside of my house sort of gives me a panic attack. I'm a believer in the concept that people should not be followed and photographed everywhere.","Before 'Twilight,' occasionally I would get the 'Hey are you that girl from that movie?' but no one knew my first and last name. The fans of the saga are amazing, and it's very flattering.","I just wrapped 'Eclipse' yesterday and the last scene we shot is probably my favorite thus far. I finally got to tell my story, in a very gentle yet elaborate way.","Junior high is so much worse than high school because at least in high school different is more accepted, celebrated actually: all the girls with blue hair and gothic Hello Kitty backpacks.","My boyfriend, who I love to death - he's only 17 so he's the youngest guy I've ever dated - he just moved here from Hawaii to be with me and I met him when I was 10. Anyway, in Hawaii they have such a different mentality and different priorities.","When you're playing a character in a book, there's already a lot of pressure because all of the millions of people who have read the series have been able to envision and become very attached to the characters.","The frenzy of the little-girl culture is something very unique, and I can only say that because I was one. The obsession - I can't really explain it. Everything is heightened to the maximum.","Tina Fey could run this country before Sarah Palin could!","People send everyone hate mail. That's the way the world works right now, I'm nothing special.","Right now I'm in 'Twilight' and I go around to signings and there are people screaming and crying, and it's so surreal. I know that when this is over in a month or two and whenever 'Twilight's no longer relevant, that doesn't live on for me. It's because of this. It's not very often that this happens for people.","Just because you're part of 'Twilight' does not mean you're a superstar. It means that you're given the opportunity to maybe become one later if you work hard. Once fandom goes away, which it will very soon, it's all about having your priorities straight and working hard.","I had a great time making the last movie, 'Eclipse.' We shot my back-story stuff from the 1930's. But I was waiting for 'Breaking Dawn' because I love the relationship Rosalie has with Jacob and the rest of her family and Bella. She also provides comic relief.","If I can have the opportunity to go into an editing room, it's like the golden ticket for me. All I want is to learn about everything else in the filmmaking process. I just directed a music video which just came out and that'd sort of be the area of the field that I'm going to move into, I hope.","I have friends come over and we read plays out loud and I make paintings and I just do things all the time just so I don't ever feel like I'm sitting around.","For some reason, young girls, they don't want the guy that's just there.","I'm into outdoor sports like hiking, windsurfing, water-skiing.","My mom's the strongest, boldest woman I know.","I love jewellery, and the idea of having something you've created become tangible is really exciting.","My brother and I have matching tattoos on our arms. It says, 'Humility is strength,' in Portuguese and Italian, because my genius brother taught English in both Italy and Brazil.","The great thing about Adele is if you put her on top volume, you actually sound like her while you're singing.","It's nonstop Ben Harper in my apartment.","Young people are fascinated with the idea of love, maybe because they haven't experienced it. The older you get, the more jaded you become with this, like, mystical love thing. It's not as exciting because it's not unknown.","People definitely wait outside my house, hotel, apartment, whatever, asking for hugs or autographs.","If I'm getting on an airplane or anywhere, really, I have a lunch box and stuff. It's a running joke with my friends and family - everyone gives me lunch boxes for Christmas.","I have speakers all over my house because music is such a huge, huge part of who I am.","I make all my body lotions by just mixing oils.","My rule is: If I can eat it, I can put it on my skin.","Coconut oil mixed with olive oil is what I put on my body every day; I put rose hip oil on my face. If my hair feels dry, instead of going and buying something filled with chemicals, I put egg whites or avocados or mayonnaise in my hair. I leave it on there for an hour or two and I wash it out.","This may sound surprising for someone who works in Hollywood, but I do not count calories, and I don't even care about weight gain, which I know sounds really bizarre. I listen to my body. I don't just wake up in the morning and cook whatever I eat.","At the age of 21, I had never even stepped on a treadmill.","While most people turn 21 and decide to go out and party, I turned 21 and decided that I was going to become somebody that I never thought I could be: somebody who cares about herself and her body, her future, and her health.","For the most part, I try to stay away from high fructose corn syrup and citric acid.","I try to think of food like fuel. I don't look at calories; I just look at ingredients. If my body were an engine, what would make it run? What would make it perform at its highest level?","Who thinks to put sunblock on the back of their kneecaps? Not me.","What do I geek out over? I mean, totally, I geek out over Hanson. Duh.","I always wanted to be a makeup artist. When I don't get to have my stylist, I do my own makeup!","My dad is a man that, for as long as I can remember, has kept a book of favorite things his kids say.","Parents are in denial a lot of the time - everybody knows what they did as a teenager, but somehow, when they grow up, it all disappears.","I kind of went through a rough period. I could have kept going down that road and then off the cliff and into the ocean.","There is still so much drama in my life, but I'm not a sad person anymore.","I mostly eat plant-based, so give me an avocado or something, even late at night, and I'll be happy.","I love making things for people.","I have a long-standing relationship with Autism Speaks. I've been supporting them for many, many years now.","Animals, until you have kids of your own, animals are your kids.","I guess the older I get, the more understanding and forgiving I've become.","I have great respect for actors like Jodie Foster and Natalie Portman who went to school the entire time they were acting. All I did was one small little independent film, and I realised I couldn't balance both lives.","My dad's Jewish and my mum is Christian, so I grew up with no religion. Just whatever religion I wanted.","In Hollywood, no one is happy with who they are. When they're young, they want to look older. When they're older, they're getting botox shot in their face to look younger.","People think that saving the planet or finding their place in that effort is a really overwhelming thought.","I love writing. I feel more connected to that than I do a lot of the other things.","I write because it feels good, and I don't have a deadline, and I don't have people telling me what they want me to write. Maybe if I did, I wouldn't be very good at it.","When I get hate mail, I get really down on myself, and I read it to my mom, and my mom is like, 'So what? Who cares? These people don't know you, so you can't take the praise or the hate to heart.'","With everything great comes a price, always, right?","My name is not big enough for people to go, 'Let me throw money at you because you're so famous!'","I was a very sensitive kid who then had to condition myself to desensitize.","I didn't have any media training - I didn't have anybody but myself.","DJ Qualls and I have been best friends for I don't even know how long - since I was a kid, 14, 15, many, many years.","I play characters that are pretty; I play characters that are sort of intimidating and confident, but that doesn't necessarily mean that I'm that.","I went back to high school and decided that I wanted to be a kid for a while, whatever that means, but once again I found myself back with acting, so clearly I couldn't escape the passion.","When I'm challenged, I grow. I never want to be in a situation where I'm not challenged and not afraid. One of my favorite feelings is stepping into a film and knowing that I'm a little bit afraid of what I have to accomplish.","My goal is to play characters that I feel I can contribute to and also ones I can contribute back to my life.","I didn't have the safety net that a lot of young actresses have. A lot of young girls have their families around to support them and help choose wisely.","I think for women especially, writing and creating your own role, producing, directing - having some control over what you do is really important. We can pave the way for other women to send what messages they want sent.","It's frustrating to not be able to wear the same dress twice, so I don't have a go-to dress like all girls do. Renting is definitely going to be my new fashion obsession.","I'm really into the Tom Ford lipsticks. I was always afraid to wear lip color because I thought it made me look too masculine, but my makeup artist Fiona Stiles got me into wearing coral, orange-y colors from his line, and now I wear lipstick all of the time.","My mom and I would make bracelets and necklaces, and I would sell it in the first, second, and third grades because that was my lunch money.","Everyone in my family has some kind of artistic tendency. My great grandmother was a jewelry designer, and her daughter was a ceramic tile muralist.","My dad designed houses and was an architect for many years.","I do feel like by buying rats from a pet store, you are saving them because if not, they would get fed to a snake or something.","My mom and I built a guest house on my property so that my mom could help me fostering animals. I do multiple fosters a month.","I love wearing things that come with a story.","Some of my favorite pieces were my mom's, and most of those she actually hand made. I would say if my style reflects anyone or anything, it's her.","I don't know if I'm supposed to say this, but probably not... I was a really cynical child.","I still have very normal insecurities, but I've always been made to feel like a body is a body, and it's not supposed to look like what you see in the media.","If I told you how many times guys on set get spray muscles... men need to realize that they don't need to live up to what they think they need to live up to!","I do a lot of reading about food and the food industry, so I try to eat locally and go to the farmer's market.","My brother and I had a lot of freedom growing up, and thankfully, we both turned out OK.","I learned how to change a cloth diaper on a raccoon. I was maybe 8 or 9."],"Nikki Sixx":["If you don't deal with your demons, they will deal with you, and it's gonna hurt.","I've got so many mountains to climb and goals to conquer. I've got so many scars I want to leave on the planet. I just feel like I'm not there yet. I feel like I am just getting started.","Ego is the great enemy. Ego will hold you back every single time.","It's interesting. People go to an animal shelter and pick a dog that's been kicked, beaten, and has lost a leg and an eye, and they'll take that dog home and give it love and support, but they don't do that with people.","I forgive my mom for being a psycho and my dad for being a loser.","People say I have a distorted lens. I think I see things as they really are.","Reflecting back, we all make mistakes; we all go through our stuff - relationships, financial, all kinds of stuff - and if you can grow from that and pass that message on, it's a pretty cool thing.","I just think if I can go from being a homeless kid with a dream of being in the biggest band in the world and making that happen, I can do a lot of other cool stuff, too.","Some kid gets his first iPhone, signs up to Twitter, and then tweets, 'Nikki Sixx sucks.' And I'm supposed to take that personally.","We all fall off the wagon. It's only one day; it's not the rest of your life. Pick yourself up and go again.","You can't pee like a puppy if you wanna run with the big dogs.","It's just kind of known in the music industry that a farewell tour means 'for now.'","I love Starbucks. Maybe that's a bit sad. But I definitely need my caffeine. It's what gets me out of bed in the morning.","You get clarity as you get sober, and you get clarity as you get older.","I love the way my tattoos look. I especially love Japanese-style tattoos and being completely sleeved by them, so it's not just these little individual and unrelated pieces, but everything's working together to create a larger design.","You can get through anything if you want it bad enough.","The funny thing is that when you have any form of presentation to your band, meaning you have the foresight to see outside of your creativity, you have a bigger vision.","SIXX: A.M. is a passion project. I think when you do things like that and put your heart into them and do your best and don't necessarily put them on a marketing grid, that's when things turn out the best.","I think anything that's creative really takes my mind off whatever it is that I'm going through in my life. If you're going through heartbreak, and you can write a song, it's a wonderful win-win, because it takes your mind off the heartbreak, and you get to vent.","You have to age gracefully. And that's what I love about Keith Richards. That's what I love about the Rolling Stones. They are aging gracefully. They are falling apart at the seams right before our eyes, and they are doing it gracefully. And that's the most beautiful thing that we can do.","It's really cool to know that there are so many people out there that are attached to me or projects that I've done to really feel that it's a personal relationship.","Celebrities, movie stars and rock stars are losing their mystique.","Beauty, to me, is kind, generous, and people that are humble.","Who's the new Ramones, who's the new Guns 'N Roses, who's the new Motley Crue, who's the new Black Sabbath? They're coming, they're on the street, they're 16, 17 years old.","What's the best angle to cut someone's throat? Well, usually from behind. That's usually how it works.","We have a growing new fan base, and we wanted to get out now, and play now, and the timing was right.","I know when I wear a Led Zeppelin shirt, I am happy to put that Led Zeppelin shirt on. It's not, 'Well, they kind of suck.'","For me, one of the things that I get excited about is getting in situations I shouldn't be in.","I think that music is a lifestyle that you sort of intravenously plug into and unplug from when you do and don't need it. Some people live it 10 hours a day, some on weekends. It's no more important or non-important than that.","Sometimes I journal three pages, sometimes I journal thirty pages, but I'm writing all the time, and whatever's happening is happening in real time for me.","When the addict gets recovery, his family gets recovery, right?","Addiction is a really hard thing to kick.","If I'm watching my favorite boxer, and he's just won the heavyweight championship of the world, and he retires, it kind of makes the guy a legend.","One thing I've always loved doing is hanging out and talking music with other artists.","If your album sells, that's cool, more people find out about you, more people get turned on to what we're really about-which is a live rock and roll band.","I'm not religious, but by nature I am spiritual. I'm an artist, and creativity seems to go hand in hand with spirituality. But I have a knee-jerk reaction against organized religions. Actually, I have knee-jerk reactions against anything that's organized.","We were telling everybody we weren't getting back together when we were in the studio actually recording. We wanted to try it on, to see how it would fit.","We each have our own tour bus. We've never done that before.","We did something this year that was not based on animosity.","There's so much history amongst ourselve that reminds us of something, and we start cracking up.","There's a pattern when tours start - a pattern of infighting, of making up, of breaking up, of addiction. There's a pattern of going to jail. There's a pattern of passion for music.","The music industry is saying, This is the format, and if you'll fit into this format, you can be on radio, and if radio will play you, MTV will expose you, and MTV will expose you, we'll sell records.","The industry is a menace to artists.","The book is really, really dark, to the point where some people that I've talked to have said that it could be a series. And I'm like, Where? VH1? It's a little hard for VH1.","Some cats, Iggy Pop, they're going to always have that hunger.","Motley Crue, collectively and individually, have done things on our own terms.","It's about what happens on stage, whether we can deliver it in a hungry way that is who we are in our hearts.","If you were on the phone with me and Tommy right now, we would probably forget you were there, we'd just be cracking jokes. It's like Beavis and Butthead.","I've got five kids and I'm married, Tommy's got two kids and he's been married, Vince just got married again, Mick's out of a relationship, Tommy's single as well. We've done a lot in our life, we've covered a lot of miles.","I harbored a lot of resentment as a teenager and as a young adult. I still have a problem with authority, I'm trying to listen!","I don't want to jump through hoops for people.","Formats are going to change because this is what the people want. It's not what the labels want.","Each guy has his own space. We all end up in one of the other guy's rooms all the time. We always end up together, as far as people getting along.","Artists are very young, and say, Um, ok, to these industry dudes.","Every day, I wake up, and the first thing I think of is my kids.","There's nothing unique about me as a parent. I am a parent. My kids are kids. We do the best we can do.","How lucky can one guy get? I was a runaway, and then I was in one of the biggest bands in the world. I've sold out every arena. I've sold millions and millions of records.","My main camera is a Nikon D3. I use a French camera from the 1800s for wet plate photography, I use a Hasselblad sometimes. But to me the camera really doesn't matter that much. I don't have a preference for film or digital.","If you actually dissect the lyrics in 'Motley Crue', you'll notice that there's a lot going on beneath the surface.","It's physically very, very, very trying to be onstage as a performer, not unlike an athlete, for thirty years.","You want to love unconditionally everything you do, or don't do it.","In the end, the whole Internet thing kills me, because you can use it as a positive thing or you can read into all the negativity. And I think you've gotta put out positive energy, put out cool viral stuff, and then just stay out of people's opinions.","I've always had an eye for the oddities in life.","Even as a kid, I saw the world in my own way and thought most things that were different were beautiful and magical. Even things that other people thought were horrifying and disgusting and weird.","I remember, when I was a kid, listening to the radio and hearing 'Big Bad John' by Jimmy Dean - and it just blew me away. I used to sit there and call the radio stations and request that song. And then the Beatles were obviously out already, but I really didn't know about the Beatles.","Let me explain something: I'm not incredibly rich.","I don't really care what people do.","Hey, man, I like to look good; I wear make-up.","I never understood the hit-single, quick-success, get-airplay mentality.","Traveling around the country, meeting fans and hearing their stories in person and on my radio show has reenergized my commitment to creating honest and inspirational content that not only serves my own creative purposes but can help and touch others as well.","As a lyricist, I'm really trying to raise my level of quality.","Being able to say something lyrically, to say something that will do more than just be words, is really hard. It's easy to do when you're writing a chapter of a book or writing poetry, but it's really hard to do when you're confined to a melody line.","I'm a sponge for information.","Los Angeles has been my home since the days even before Motley Crue, so I am beyond excited that 'The Side Show' has found a home on 98.7 FM. This is the station I listen to - my friends listen to it, my family listens to it. It's the station I wanted to be on, and I'm psyched to get started.","I remember opening up my first vinyl and seeing the incredible artwork it had. There's nothing like it. You also get that true gritty sound on vinyl that really makes a rock record sound great, which CDs can never achieve.","When it comes to putting together a new show, we always push the envelope, and that's part of Motley Crue's legacy.","There's always people saying that rock is dead, rock is over. People are always out to kill rock and roll.","How can you have a rock n' roll circus without a midget?","I never understood bands saying Nirvana had anything to do with derailing their career. Maybe those bands didn't have the goods.","I remember Iggy and the Stooges' song 'Search and Destroy' reaching out from my speakers to me like my own personal anthem.","When Ozzy calls and asks you to go on tour, you say, 'When do I start?'","Politicians really worry about being politically correct.","If you're getting different prescriptions from different doctors, there has to be some sort of check and balance in there somewhere.","I had to find the courage to turn my life around.","What's scummy about the music industry is that everybody loves you when you're dead.","What can I say that will make people that are in recovery want to stand up and support Recovery Month? A friend of mine said, 'You know, the fact that you did a really honest book and it changed people's lives, that's something to talk about.'","The other day I went to a movie with some friends, and they were like, 'Let's look it up on the Internet and see what people are saying,' and I was like, 'Man, that's messed up.'","Through recovery, I've been able to do so much good stuff.","I have a wonderful assistant. I tell her I need four amputees and a midget, and she finds them.","I sport a cave-man mentality.","It takes all kinds to make the world go 'round. If everyone was straight-laced and uptight, it would sure be a drag. We need a little tug of war in society.","I love women. My life revolves around them.","There's no difference if you're a supermodel or if you've lost both your legs. What are you doing that's beautiful or ugly on the inside?","In '85, I went through rehab and I wasn't ready. If you're not ready, you're not ready. You don't want to hear the truth, and you're gonna keep doing what you keep doing.","For me, to turn people on to new music, on to things that are going on in the world, is important.","I listen to NPR a lot. I love that.","I'm always willing to talk to somebody if they have something to say that is interesting.","It wasn't like I picked a camera up in 1989 and stopped making music. I picked a camera up and found another form of expression.","Growing up in the '70s, it was only a few years before that when men started to grow their hair long. And in the '70s, people were pushing the envelope a little farther, with men having even more style and piercing both their ears and wearing makeup.","I'm not bothered by my appearance.","I can't stand people who try too hard.","I don't want to interview people. I want to have a conversation. I want to talk to Paul McCartney about the bass sound on 'The White Album.'","What inspires me? I am so inspired every day. I am inspired by thinkers. I am inspired by rebellion. I am inspired by children. I have been inspired by love.","You can't lie to your audience. You can't lie to your fans."],"Nikki Ziering":["I'm definitely not a football player, but I can play one for a season.","I definitely think that comedy is my niche.","I was studying to be a dental hygienist and working as a dental assistant. I met a photographer and decided to put my job on hold for just a summer to begin modeling.","I learned how to play football and I got pretty good at it. I enjoyed being on a team with other girls. In Hollywood, girls are always competing against one another, so it was nice to be on a team with other girls for a change.","Guys that play videogames are hot!"],"Niklas Zennstrom":["Surround yourself with smart, dedicated people - to build something isn't a one-man show. It's more important to have smart people who really believe in what you're doing than really experienced people who may not share your dream.","The telephone is a 100-year-old technology. It's time for a change. Charging for phone calls is something you did last century.","If you want to be an entrepreneur, it's not a job, it's a lifestyle. It defines you. Forget about vacations, about going home at 6 pm - last thing at night you'll send emails, first thing in the morning you'll read emails, and you'll wake up in the middle of the night. But it's hugely rewarding as you're fulfilling something for yourself.","We have just started, and if you compare the number of people using Skype to the number using a telephone network around the world, we're still just starting.","People need to access Skype wirelessly, no matter where they are, and what happens is that we'll be taking advantage of the rollout of Internet everywhere - WiFi and WiMax in particular.","When a business becomes successful seemingly overnight, no one knows about all the months and years you've invested, all the projects you've tried before that didn't work.","Talent can pop up anywhere in the world, it's not just one city block.","We also have a conference call feature where up to five people can talk on one Skype call.","With our work at Kazaa, we began seeing growing broadband connections and more powerful computers and more streaming multimedia, and we saw that the traditional way of communicating by phone no longer made a lot of sense.","When radio stations started playing music the record companies started suing radio stations. They thought now that people could listen to music for free, who would want to buy a record in a record shop? But I think we all agree that radio stations are good stuff.","What we are doing is taking advantage of the broadband Internet to provide basically unlimited free calls to anyone at a higher voice quality than they can with the phone lines.","We have 2 million users in the U.S. and about 13 million worldwide in more than 200 countries.","They also can combine voice with instant messaging and online file sharing.","Then people started using it more and more and it became the most downloaded software on the internet.","Skype is for any individual who has a broadband Internet connection.","Skype is easy enough to use so that people don't need to be tech savvy - a lot of users just want to communicate with their friends and family, and they find this is the easiest, cheapest way.","It is very similar to companies like Google and other internet companies. When you go and search on Google you don't pay for that. But sometimes you click on an advert and Google makes money on that.","In fact, we just surpassed our first 1 million simultaneous users online.","If you could utilize the resources of the end users' computers, you could do things much more efficiently.","If you can use a Web browser, you can use Skype.","Another differentiator is that Skype is free and simple to set up, and it costs us virtually nothing for a new user to join the Skype network, which is why we can offer the service for free.","And the VCR did the same thing: the movie industry thought nobody would ever watch movies any more.","It's extremely hard to build a company with a product that everyone loves, is free and has no business model, and then to innovate a business model. I did that with Kazaa, had half a billion downloads but that wasn't a sustainable business.","As an investor, what we're not looking for is 'oh this is a cool app,' it's 'is this something that can become a big business?' You need to find those that can become real businesses.","As an entrepreneur, if you're the originator, you need to be faster than ever.","When we look at investing, we always think about 'how defensible is this, how likely is it that somebody is going to copy this.' E-commerce tends to be something easy to copy because it's execution.","Skype is easy enough to use so that people don't need to be tech savvy - a lot of users just want to communicate with their friends and family, and they find this is the easiest, cheapest way. If you can use a Web browser, you can use Skype.","We have 2 million users in the U.S. and about 13 million worldwide in more than 200 countries. We're getting 80,000 new users each day. And more than half a million people are connected via Skype at any given moment.","You shouldn't be afraid of failure - when something fails, you think, 'What did I learn from that experience? I can do better next time.' Then kill that project and move on to the next. Don't get disappointed.","Today as an entrepreneur you have more options.","Angry Birds is one of the fastest-growing online products I've seen, growing even faster than Skype, and the company has done a brilliant job of extending it across different platforms and merchandise.","Video is moving online in a big way. It's proven to be a challenging market for some companies that start out as a pure Internet company such as Joost.","Some Internet operators are concerned that video services such as Netflix and YouTube consume lots of the bandwidth on the network. While there is some truth to this, my guess is that the operators wished they could provide the same kind of services with the same success as Netflix and YouTube.","I try not to dwell on big mistakes but to move on when I make a mistake. I make mistakes most of the times and that's part of the risk profile being an entrepreneur. I guess one big mistake I did was not to start my own company earlier. I spent nine years working for others before starting Kazaa in 2000.","I hope that my investment into Atomico will become my best financial investment to date.","The next Google or Facebook will come from somewhere other than Silicon Valley.","The Chinese market is very, very unique.","Look for when the environment is changing - the big shift now is mobile Internet. It's really happening big-time. The way you interact with services on a smart phone compared to the Web is quite different, so there's a huge opportunity.","When we started Skype, if you look at analyst reports, no one forecasted it as a big business. Also when Google started, it was not fashionable to be in search. It's not trying to do the obvious - that's the hard part.","Silicon Valley is the best place to start a tech company in so many ways.","International markets are much bigger than the U.S. In Sweden we have 9 million inhabitants, and if you're successful in Sweden, you're not successful - it's such a small market.","You have 1 billion people using the Internet with 200 million of those now using broadband internet connections, so the Internet has become a powerful network. It can carry calls.","The thing about the Internet is the openness. People can link to each other themselves."],"Niklaus Wirth":["But quality of work can be expected only through personal satisfaction, dedication and enjoyment. In our profession, precision and perfection are not a dispensible luxury, but a simple necessity.","Program construction consists of a sequence of refinement steps.","Yet, I am convinced that there is a need for high quality software, and the time will come when it will be recognized that it is worth investing effort in its development and in using a careful, structured approach based on safe, structured languages.","The possible solutions to a given problem emerge as the leaves of a tree, each node representing a point of deliberation and decision.","A good designer must rely on experience, on precise, logic thinking; and on pedantic exactness. No magic will do.","Experience shows that the success of a programming course critically depends on the choice of these examples.","Programming is usually taught by examples.","Software development is technical activity conducted by human beings.","In the practical world of computing, it is rather uncommon that a program, once it performs correctly and satisfactorily, remains unchanged forever.","But active programming consists of the design of new programs, rather than contemplation of old programs.","Clearly, programming courses should teach methods of design and construction, and the selected examples should be such that a gradual development can be nicely demonstrated.","I have never designed a language for its own sake.","Indeed, the woes of Software Engineering are not due to lack of tools, or proper management, but largely due to lack of sufficient technical competence.","It is evidently necessary to generate and test candidates for solutions in some systematic manner.","Many people tend to look at programming styles and languages like religions: if you belong to one, you cannot belong to others. But this analogy is another fallacy.","My being a teacher had a decisive influence on making language and systems as simple as possible so that in my teaching, I could concentrate on the essential issues of programming rather than on details of language and notation.","My duty as a teacher is to train, educate future programmers.","Nevertheless, I consider OOP as an aspect of programming in the large; that is, as an aspect that logically follows programming in the small and requires sound knowledge of procedural programming.","Our ultimate goal is extensible programming (EP). By this, we mean the construction of hierarchies of modules, each module adding new functionality to the system.","The idea that one might derive satisfaction from his or her successful work, because that work is ingenious, beautiful, or just pleasing, has become ridiculed.","Usually its users discover sooner or later that their program does not deliver all the desired results, or worse, that the results requested were not the ones really needed."],"Nikola Tesla":["It is paradoxical, yet true, to say, that the more we know, the more ignorant we become in the absolute sense, for it is only through enlightenment that we become conscious of our limitations. Precisely one of the most gratifying results of intellectual evolution is the continuous opening up of new and greater prospects.","I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men.","I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.","Today's scientists have substituted mathematics for experiments, and they wander off through equation after equation, and eventually build a structure which has no relation to reality.","Let the future tell the truth, and evaluate each one according to his work and accomplishments. The present is theirs; the future, for which I have really worked, is mine.","Every living being is an engine geared to the wheelwork of the universe. Though seemingly affected only by its immediate surrounding, the sphere of external influence extends to infinite distance.","The year 2100 will see eugenics universally established. In past ages, the law governing the survival of the fittest roughly weeded out the less desirable strains. Then man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. As a result, we continue to keep alive and to breed the unfit.","The history of science shows that theories are perishable. With every new truth that is revealed we get a better understanding of Nature and our conceptions and views are modified.","There is no doubt that some plant food, such as oatmeal, is more economical than meat, and superior to it in regard to both mechanical and mental performance. Such food, moreover, taxes our digestive organs decidedly less, and, in making us more contented and sociable, produces an amount of good difficult to estimate.","All knowledge or form conception is evoked through the medium of the eye, either in response to disturbances directly received on the retina or to their fainter secondary effects and reverberations. Other sense organs can only call forth feelings which have no reality of existence and of which no conception can be formed.","In the twenty-first century, the robot will take the place which slave labor occupied in ancient civilization.","Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more.","With ideas it is like with dizzy heights you climb: At first they cause you discomfort and you are anxious to get down, distrustful of your own powers; but soon the remoteness of the turmoil of life and the inspiring influence of the altitude calm your blood; your step gets firm and sure and you begin to look - for dizzier heights.","Electrical science has revealed to us the true nature of light, has provided us with innumerable appliances and instruments of precision, and has thereby vastly added to the exactness of our knowledge.","The spread of civilisation may be likened to a fire; first, a feeble spark, next a flickering flame, then a mighty blaze, ever increasing in speed and power.","The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane.","We have soon to have everywhere smoke annihilators, dust absorbers, ozonizers, sterilizers of water, air, food and clothing, and accident preventers on streets, elevated roads and in subways. It will become next to impossible to contract disease germs or get hurt in the city, and country folk will got to town to rest and get well.","The human being is a self-propelled automaton entirely under the control of external influences. Willful and predetermined though they appear, his actions are governed not from within, but from without. He is like a float tossed about by the waves of a turbulent sea.","We wind a simple ring of iron with coils; we establish the connections to the generator, and with wonder and delight we note the effects of strange forces which we bring into play, which allow us to transform, to transmit and direct energy at will.","I myself eschew all stimulants. I also practically abstain from meat.","From my childhood I had been intended for the clergy. This prospect hung like a dark cloud on my mind.","Of the various branches of electrical investigation, perhaps the most interesting and immediately the most promising is that dealing with alternating currents.","Archimedes was my ideal. I admired the works of artists, but to my mind, they were only shadows and semblances. The inventor, I thought, gives to the world creations which are palpable, which live and work.","There is no memory or retentive faculty based on lasting impression. What we designate as memory is but increased responsiveness to repeated stimuli.","The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is like that of the planter - for the future. His duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come, and point the way.","In a time not distant, it will be possible to flash any image formed in thought on a screen and render it visible at any place desired. The perfection of this means of reading thought will create a revolution for the better in all our social relations.","It seems that I have always been ahead of my time. I had to wait nineteen years before Niagara was harnessed by my system, fifteen years before the basic inventions for wireless which I gave to the world in 1893 were applied universally.","Modern science says: 'The sun is the past, the earth is the present, the moon is the future.' From an incandescent mass we have originated, and into a frozen mass we shall turn. Merciless is the law of nature, and rapidly and irresistibly we are drawn to our doom.","The earth is bountiful, and where her bounty fails, nitrogen drawn from the air will refertilize her womb. I developed a process for this purpose in 1900. It was perfected fourteen years later under the stress of war by German chemists.","If we want to reduce poverty and misery, if we want to give to every deserving individual what is needed for a safe existence of an intelligent being, we want to provide more machinery, more power. Power is our mainstay, the primary source of our many-sided energies.","I constructed a laboratory in the neighborhood of Pike's Peak. The conditions in the pure air of the Colorado Mountains proved extremely favorable for my experiments, and the results were most gratifying to me.","By an irony of fate, my first employment was as a draughtsman. I hated drawing; it was for me the very worst of annoyances. Fortunately, it was not long before I secured the position I sought, that of chief electrician to the telephone company.","The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.","Electrical science has disclosed to us the more intimate relation existing between widely different forces and phenomena and has thus led us to a more complete comprehension of Nature and its many manifestations to our senses.","The harness of waterfalls is the most economical method known for drawing energy from the sun.","As in nature, all is ebb and tide, all is wave motion, so it seems that in all branches of industry, alternating currents - electric wave motion - will have the sway.","The Secretary of Hygiene or Physical Culture will be far more important in the cabinet of the President of the United States who holds office in the year 2035 than the Secretary of War.","There is no conflict between the ideal of religion and the ideal of science, but science is opposed to theological dogmas because science is founded on fact. To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end. The human being is no exception to the natural order. Man, like the universe, is a machine.","I have already demonstrated, by crucial tests, the practicability of signaling by my system from one to any other point of the globe, no matter how remote, and I shall soon convert the disbelievers.","The universal utilization of water power and its long-distance transmission will supply every household with cheap power and will dispense with the necessity of burning fuel. The struggle for existence being lessened, there should be development along ideal rather than material lines.","When a coil is operated with currents of very high frequency, beautiful brush effects may be produced, even if the coil be of comparatively small dimensions. The experimenter may vary them in many ways, and, if it were nothing else, they afford a pleasing sight.","The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny.","The newspapers of the twenty-first century will give a mere 'stick' in the back pages to accounts of crime or political controversies, but will headline on the front pages the proclamation of a new scientific hypothesis."],"Nikolaas Tinbergen":["As a boy, I had two small aquaria in our backyard in which I watched, each spring, the nest building and other fascinating behaviours of sticklebacks.","Whenever a gentle pressure is used to make a slight change in leg posture, the neck muscles react immediately. Conversely, when the therapist helps one to 'release' the neck muscles, it is amazing to see quite pronounced movements for instance of the toes, even when one is lying on a couch.","I was not much interested in school, and both at secondary school and at university, I only just scraped through, with as little effort as I judged possible without failing.","Relatively many autists are first-born children. There is also a pretty widespread conviction that the parents of autists are somehow different - for instance, many of them are very serious people or people who are themselves under some sort of strain.","The majority of autists - as well as their parents - seem to be genuine victims of environmental stress.","Proper stance and movement are obviously genetically old, environment-resistant behaviours. Misuse, with all its psychosomatic or, rather, somato-psychic consequences, must therefore be considered a result of modern living conditions - of a culturally determined stress."],"Nikolai Berdyaev":["The Russian yearning for the meaning of life is the major theme of our literature, and this is the real point of our intelligentsia's existence.","Bread for myself is a material question. Bread for my neighbor is a spiritual one.","There is a tragic clash between Truth and the world. Pure undistorted truth burns up the world.","The question of bread for myself is a material question, but the question of bread for my neighbor is a spiritual question.","The enslaving of the other is also the enslaving of the self."],"Nikolai Gogol":["Countless as the sands of the sea are human passions.","I here ask pardon of all my compatriots for everything of which I have been guilty towards them. I know that, by my ill-considered and immature works, I have brought distress to many and that I have even provoked others to attack me openly and, in general, have produced displeasure in many.","I am a writer, and the duty of a writer is not only to furnish pleasant pursuits for the mind and taste: he will be held accountable if things useful to the soul are not disseminated by his works and if nothing remains after him as a precept for mankind.","You can't imagine how stupid the whole world has grown nowadays.","We ought to thank God for that. Yes, the man who tills the land is more worthy of respect than any.","They're thinking of turning the peasant into an educated man. Why, first of all they should make him a good and prosperous farmer and then he'll learn all that is necessary for him to know.","Everywhere across whatever sorrows of which our life is woven, some radiant joy will gaily flash past.","It's the most righteous, which of course is not the same thing as the most profitable.","Russia! Russia... Everything in you is open, desolate and level; your squat towns barely protrude in the midst of the plains like dots, like counters; there is nothing to tempt or enchant the onlooker's gaze. But what is this inscrutable, mysterious force that draws me to you?","Sometimes, it is enough for us to hold out a hand to receive help. It is not we who help; God helps, granting His power to the powerless word.","Let my body be delivered to the earth without attention to the place where it lies; nothing should be associated with my dusty remains. Shame on him who draws any attention to a rotted flesh that is already no longer mine: he is worshipping the worms nibbling it.","Always think of what is useful and not what is beautiful. Beauty will come of its own accord.","There are certain words which are nearer and dearer to a man than any others.","The Lord grant we may all be tillers of the soil.","Whatever you may say, the body depends on the soul.","Wise is the man who does not disdain any character and instead, examining him with a searching look, plumbs him to the very main-springs of his being.","The influence of a woman can be very great, especially now, in the present order or disorder of society, in which there is a kind of spiritual chill, a kind of moral fatigue, demanding reanimation. In order to produce this reanimation, the cooperation of woman is indispensable.","The higher truths are, the more cautious one must be with them; otherwise, they are converted into common things, and common things are not believed.","I ask everyone in Russia to pray for me, beginning with the bishops, whose whole life is a single prayer. I ask prayers also of those who humbly do not believe in the efficacy of their prayers, as well as of those who do not believe in prayer at all and even consider it useless.","It is no use to blame the looking glass if your face is awry.","Let me warn you, if you start chasing after views, you'll be left without bread and without views.","The experience of ages has shown that a man who works on the land is purer, nobler, higher, and more moral... Agriculture should be at the basis of everything. That's my idea.","For a man, the soul of a woman is a preserving talisman, guarding him from moral infections; it is a power holding him to the straight path, a guide leading him back from the crooked to the straight. On the other hand, the soul of a woman can be his evil and ruin him forever.","Atheists have not produced so much evil as hypocrites have produced, or even simply those who preached God without being prepared for Him, daring to pronounce His name with unsanctified lips.","If you have not first pondered the entire situation of the man whom you wish to help, and if you have not brought with you instructions for him to follow henceforth in leading his life, he will not receive great good from your help."],"Nikolaj Coster-Waldau":["I know nothing more annoying when people I don't know jump to conclusions on my person based on nothing but gossip or speculation.","I like to be comfortable. If I go out, if it's a premiere, I'll put on a suit and look nice. I like Hugo Boss for that.","What I love about acting is that you are exposed to so many different things. Horse-riding, sailing, travelling to amazing places.","Personally, I think fidelity is important. I don't see any point in being together if you're not being honest, having fun together, and respecting one another. Why would you stay in a relationship otherwise?","I'm in a monogamous relationship and have been for many, many years. I think it's a choice. I don't think you can generalize, though, and what works for me may not work for other people, but I don't think everybody cheats. We're all different.","Abusive relationships go on and on. You're in it for so long that it can almost be impossible to see it for what it is. That just becomes your life. We get used to and adapt.","I actually read somewhere that they measured how many calories you burn from watching movies, and horror movies are way, way up the list.","I think advice is cheap. You can only really learn by doing and making mistakes.","Horrible things happen all our lives; we all experience loss and death and trauma. Usually, most people, I think, we just get on with it. We don't have a whole soliloquy in the middle of something.","There's nothing exceptional about me, but there's something exceptional about Jaime Lannister, and I think that's what's interesting.","There are so many things to do in New York. I try to get to the theater and see some plays. I have a bicycle over here, and I ride around New York.","'Game of Thrones' is so unique, and the odds that any of us involved will be in another show like it are very slim, so I'm enjoying the ride.","Most of us have been in that situation where you've been falling in love with somebody who didn't feel the same way. It's not a nice situation.","I haven't really got any hidden talents.","When I was a kid I was always afraid of small dogs, because they always seemed like the ones that would attack.","Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be an actor.","If you look at most of the Royal Houses in Europe, the inbreeding was pretty outstanding.","I like to be comfortable.","I think we all have the capacity of evil in us.","I like to wear beautiful clothes, but I don't have that many.","What's great about 'Game of Thrones' is they change the perspective, the POV, all the time. So you will have one story told by one character and you'll go, 'Oh my God, horrible', and then maybe the season after you have the same story told but from the person you thought was just the most horrible, vile creature.","I'm a fan of great storytelling.","There's something liberating about watching someone not following the rules.","As an actor, secrets and obstacles fuel the character.","I couldn't pick up a sword and go fight anyone, let me put it that way. It's choreography and it's acting. The best sword fights you see look amazing, but it's the acting that sells it more than anything.","I was 15 or 16 when I first saw 'Once Upon A Time In America,' so I was quite young, but I was completely blown away.","I try not to regret too much. I find that feeling guilty takes up so much of my time already.","I'm a huge 'Breaking Bad' fan; I would be really annoyed if anyone told me anything about what was going to happen in the last eight episodes.","I love political dramas. I love good story-telling.","The only thing I find difficult to watch - horror movies - not that I don't like them. Like 'The Shining,' it's one of my favorite movies, but it's terrifying. I feel like I've watched a marathon afterwards.","The more secrets and twists in a character, the better.","I've never understood why you would turn down a great role.","You always dream of being part of a show that reaches and thrills an audience.","A villain to me is someone who actively seeks to hurt someone or does things for his own gain.","One thing George R. R. Martin does is surprising things to main characters. But he says so himself.","Most female actresses will have a very difficult time being made unattractive.","All actors tend to be the same messed-up people.","It's beautiful being out in the wild.","I think what's great is that, when HBO commit, they go in all guns blazing. They attract the very best set designers, the whole thing.","I did a network show in the U.S. before, and I loved it, but you have eight days to shoot an episode, and it's just a ridiculous pace.","Usually, on a show like 'Game of Thrones,' you don't have much time to rehearse; a lot of the sets are not available.","When someone you love is in pain, you want to do anything to comfort them.","I always wanted to be an actor, but I just never told anyone. I had this superstition that if I said it out loud, it wouldn't come true.","I love team sports.","You have to be sharp when the camera's rolling. I want to be totally unselfconscious, like a child playing. I do as much prep as possible so I can lose myself for those seconds.","There's a Danish architecture firm called BIG. I love architecture, and I always check out their work; they're very good at reimagining the way we live. They put the human experience as the focus, with access to air and outdoor space.","I like to read everything, really, especially autobiographies.","Tina Fey's autobiography is very, very funny and very well written. It's her life story: it's about how she grows up in New York. There's no obvious reason why I should enjoy this - I mean, this is the autobiography of a woman in her early 40s in New York. I'm a guy from a small town in Denmark.","Fart jokes still work for me.","I can't imagine life without my wife, but I don't think you should get a prize for staying together a long time.","Divorce is always terrible, but I haven't met anyone who went through it and isn't happier now.","I love skiing.","I work a lot abroad and have the most wonderful family and kids, but being away, you do miss out sometimes. I really hope I won't regret the choices in the future.","My mum was a librarian, and my dad worked in Greenland.","I don't necessarily enjoy being at the gym. It's something I have to do, more than something I look forward to doing. But it does enable me to do fun things.","Still, to this day, I can't run on the treadmill. Why not just run outside? I never understood it.","I always feel for the younger cast members in 'Game of Thrones.' They're really clever and smart.","There's a recent film, the Swedish movie 'Force Majeure.' I just thought it was brilliant.","I'm a fan of Ed Norton.","Some of the stuff in Season 3 on 'Game of Thrones' - the amount of mud I had to eat, not intentionally but by accident - was pretty tough.","I've never heard of the wife looking up the mistress to become friends, but I like it.","The most famous actress who did the 'dumb blond' routine was Marilyn Monroe, but she was a genius actress.","It's okay for a guy to be a baddie, but a woman? No, we can't deal with that.","Jerome Flynn is a great actor.","Most people can relate to that whole annoying thing when people think they know who you are.","I started at drama school at 18.","Acting in 'Game of Thrones' is all consuming.","I do remember a teacher telling me when I was about ten that I was really good at acting. I was so proud, even though I am sure he said that to all of us in the class.","I actually met a cop who worked with street gangs. I wanted to understand what drives someone who deals with very hardened criminals on a daily basis. How do you turn that off when you go home at night?","I'm very good when people dress me. But I find it difficult to spend a lot of money on clothes.","I love to go into John Varvatos and look at the beautiful leather jackets. They're beautiful and soft. I try them on, and then I look at the price tag and go and pick up a t-shirt. It's just the way I am.","My old mother, she has no idea what's going on in this world.","I would be very wrong to charge anyone to watch me dance or sing.","Everyone's expectation of New York is so big, and then you go, 'Oh, it really is like no other place on Earth!'","For my kids, it's just weird to see your dad pretend to be someone else. It's weird to see your father make out with another woman. It's not cool.","It doesn't hurt to be in 'Game of Thrones,' that's for sure, mainly because people actually see your work, and that is great.","I think the core of Jaime Lannister is actually that final line in the pilot when he says, 'The things I do for love.' He might do horrible things - and they are truly, some of them, horrific. There's no excuses. But he does it out of what he sees as a necessity, out of love.","When I was first told about 'Game of Thrones,' I didn't know the books, anything. So I read the pilot, and when I got the first script, it was clear the story was about these people and families and a constant battle for power.","Burpees are great, but they just kill you.","My ambition has always been to work with English and American actors and directors. Those were the movies that I was watching when I was growing up.","You can be as good an actor as you want but, if your accent is too strong, it's going to limit you."],"Nikos Kazantzakis":["In order to succeed, we must first believe that we can.","The real meaning of enlightenment is to gaze with undimmed eyes on all darkness.","A person needs a little madness, or else they never dare cut the rope and be free.","True teachers use themselves as bridges over which they invite their students to cross; then, having facilitated their crossing, joyfully collapse, encouraging them to create bridges of their own.","Every perfect traveler always creates the country where he travels.","Since we cannot change reality, let us change the eyes which see reality.","I said to the almond tree, 'Friend, speak to me of God,' and the almond tree blossomed.","May God forgive me, but the letters of the alphabet frighten me terribly. They are sly, shameless demons - and dangerous! You open the inkwell, release them; they run off - and how will you ever get control of them again!","When everything goes wrong, what a joy to test your soul and see if it has endurance and courage. An invisible and all-powerful enemy - some call him God, others the Devil, seem to rush upon us to destroy us; but we are not destroyed.","I knew that no matter what door you knock on in a Cretan village, it will be opened for you. A meal will be served in your honor, and you will sleep between the best sheets in the house. In Crete, the stranger is still the unknown god. Before him, all doors and all hearts are opened.","I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free.","My entire soul is a cry, and all my work is a commentary on that cry.","The struggle between God and man breaks out in everyone, together with the longing for reconciliation... God does not love weak souls and flabby flesh. The spirit desires to wrestle with flesh which is strong and full of resistance. It is a carnivorous bird which is incessantly hungry; it eats flesh and, by assimilating it, makes it disappear.","A weak soul does not have the endurance to resist the flesh for very long. It grows heavy, becomes flesh itself, and the contest ends. But among responsible men, men who keep their eyes riveted day and night upon the Supreme Duty, the conflict between flesh and spirit breaks out mercilessly and may last until death.","Let your youth have free reign. It won't come again, so be bold, and no repenting.","One of man's greatest obligations is anger.","Life is a crusade in the service of God. Whether we wished to or not, we set out as crusaders to free - not the Holy Sepulcher - but that God buried in matter and in our souls.","In religions which have lost their creative spark, the gods eventually become no more than poetic motifs or ornaments for decorating human solitude and walls.","The masses do not see the Sirens. They do not hear songs in the air. Blind, deaf, stooping, they pull at their oars in the hold of the earth. But the more select, the captains, harken to a Siren within them... and royally squander their lives with her.","Everything in this world has a hidden meaning.","Happiness is a simple everyday miracle, like water, and we are not aware of it.","There is only one woman in the world. One woman, with many faces.","Beauty is merciless. You do not look at it, it looks at you and does not forgive.","I felt deep within me that the highest point a man can attain is not Knowledge or Virtue or Goodness or Victory but something even greater, more heroic and more despairing: Sacred Awe!","We come from a dark abyss, we end in a dark abyss, and we call the luminous interval life.","Behind each woman rises the austere, sacred and mysterious face of Aphrodite.","While experiencing happiness, we have difficulty in being conscious of it. Only when the happiness is past and we look back on it do we suddenly realise - sometimes with astonishment - how happy we had been.","That part of Christ's nature which was profoundly human helps us to understand him and love him and to pursue his Passion as though it were our own. If he had not within him this warm human element, he would never be able to touch our hearts with such assurance and tenderness; he would not be able to become a model for our lives.","Nothing is nearer to us than heaven. The earth is beneath our feet, and we tread upon it, but heaven is within us.","The nonexistent is whatever we have not sufficiently desired.","In order to mount to the Cross, the summit of sacrifice, and to God, the summit of immateriality, Christ passed through all the stages which the man who struggles passes through.","What a miracle life is and how alike are all souls when they send their roots down deep and meet and are one!","Throughout my life my greatest benefactors have been my dreams and my travels; very few men, living or dead, have helped me in my struggle.","The human soul is heavy, clumsy, held in the mud of the flesh. Its perceptions are still coarse and brutish. It can divine nothing clearly, nothing with certainty.","Every man is half God, half man; he is both spirit and flesh. That is why the mystery of Christ is not simply a mystery for a particular creed: It is universal.","All my life, I struggled to stretch my mind to the breaking point, until it began to creak, in order to create a great thought which might be able to give a new meaning to life, a new meaning to death, and to console mankind.","Life is trouble. Only death is not. To be alive is to unfasten your belt and look for a fight.","My principal anguish, and the wellspring of all my joys and sorrows, has been the incessant merciless battle between the spirit and the flesh.","Tell me what you do with the food you eat, and I'll tell you who you are. Some turn their food into fat and manure, some into work and good humour, and others, I'm told, into God. So there must be three sorts of men.","God hates a half-devil ten times more than an arch-devil!","My 'Report to Greco' is not an autobiography.","I fight to embrace the entire circle of human activity to the full extent of my ability."],"Nile Rodgers":["I'm always swimming forward like a shark. You just keep going and you don't rest. I love waking up knowing that I have a problem to solve.","If I could live in one city and do every single thing I do there, I would choose Venice. You can't turn your head without seeing something amazing.","Music is the one part of the entertainment business where you can't fool anybody into buying a record.","Art, well good art at least, takes you to a place you go during the experience of it, and then after you experience it you are different.","I've had insomnia since I was five years old. I just don't require much sleep. I'm never tired.","I've found great solace in finally taking care of myself and others.","The only person I have regrets about is Miles Davis. He and I had become good friends after we did a photo shoot, and coincidentally, we kept running into each other at parties and stuff. I regret not having written a hit for Miles Davis.","I'm a record producer and songwriter; I'm a problem-solver.","My career has been wacky and not at all normal. I've never had a manager, nobody gets jobs for me. I wind up working with artists that I meet.","Bands always call me when they are in need of a boost and I come in and put them back on top.","It feels like my job is to support people. I support great artists. When I worked with a symphony, I sat in the third chair, not the first chair.","Any real record person knows that the number one most powerful marketing tool when it comes to music is repetition.","You can fool a person into going to see a movie with a good trailer.","With Sumthin Else Music Works, I wanted to spread the love and give newcomers a chance to make it because something that really helped me were all the people who had given me an opportunity when I was putting my career together.","I think the hardest thing to overcome is judging yourself and being your own worst critic so to speak.","Art is something that opens up and enhances your emotions and that's what I like to think I'm doing.","Every record I have done was because I was a person's friend. The only time we did not continue to be friends was if the record did not become a hit. If it did, we became great friends.","It was actually my partner, Bernard Edwards, who helped me develop my sort of funky jazz style.","Nobody under the sun was like Madonna. She was positive and clear and wholly dedicated to achieving everything that she's achieved.","My life was really interesting before 'Chic.'","Trust me, the only real way to understand 'Chic' is in highfalutin terms. Our chord progressions were based on European modal melodies. I made those early 'Chic' records to impress my jazz friends.","I am very rich because of 'Chic' - artistically as well as spiritually. It's been an amazing life.","I'd probably be a super wealthy guy if I had sat around writing songs and getting them placed like everyone else I know. But I write songs about people or after I meet them and they're somewhat biographical - they're fiction but also non-fiction.","I wouldn't know how to retire.","There's never been a song that I just wrote and tried to send to an artist.","I've been working since I was a child. I worked cutting lawns, delivering newspapers; I was a telephone salesperson; I was a guitar repairman.","I'm always the last person in the world who would ever try to predict a trend.","Music has to keep moving. But I was lucky. For me there was always something around the corner.","There's been this strange irony to my whole life. All my original bandmates have died, when I was the most wild and most reckless of us all. But I'm still here.","My childhood was bittersweet in many ways. We moved around a lot. By the time I was 10, I had travelled thousands of miles, often on my own. My parents were like my friends, so it felt like I didn't really have parents at all. But in a crazy way that was very liberating. It forced me to be independent, maybe a leader, and certainly a survivor.","I was a fan of the Marx Brothers. One of them had this character where he pretended not to be able to talk, but then he wrote this autobiography called 'Harpo Speaks!' He wrote about how he quit school at nine years old to become a professional.","When I go on vacation, I take very few clothes and a whole lot of books. It's the most soothing thing in the world. Reading 'Moby-Dick' is like being in a time machine. I almost feel as excited as the first time I read it and I always find something new.","I'm completely obsessed with the film versions of 'Superman'.","I never wished my parents were normal, because they were unique, special and fabulous.","I called all adults by their first names, and my mum was just another adult. I was the firstborn of my generation in the family, but because I was so close to my parents in age, they treated me with a kind of adult respect. They talked to me as an equal.","I love Madonna! If you want to see the Madonna I know, just go on YouTube and you'll see those early interviews before the record came out. She was giddy and wonderful and giggly and happy and so excited looking towards the future.","If something is worth doing, it's worth overdoing.","I've never cancelled any public appearance, simply because that's what my life is; it's doing my work, and I never want to stop doing my work unless it becomes impossible for me to do it.","When people tell you you're on the brink of death, you've got to dig pretty deep to get it together.","I only work with people I like.","Almost all the producers I know and dig, like Quincy Jones or Brian Eno, are really musicians first. I'm a composer, an orchestrator, an arranger and a musician first. I know how to write and rewrite songs, and the genius is really in the rewriting.","My responsibility is to the artist first. There's something that artists intrinsically know about their music and their fanbase that neither the record company nor the producer really knows.","I don't believe in the philosophy of stumbling across hit records.","Everything about my life was culturally rich, and all the people I met sort of reinforced the wackiness that was normally inside of me. No one said, 'You can't do that,' until I got to real record companies, that is.","I would play hooky from school and spend all day in the movie theaters. Consequently, I learned satire in all its subtle forms.","I grew up in the era of the concept album. What I do now is pick up on singles, and they are their own complete stories; you don't necessarily have to hear the rest of the album because I don't think albums are created like that anymore. They get songs from all over the place.","I grew as close to Madonna as I've ever been to a woman without being romantically involved.","When I was very young, there was a lot of music at home, mostly jazz. I was walking around singing and pretending I was in bands from a very young age. But the first song that was really personal to me was 'Blue Suede Shoes'.","I used to play flute and clarinet at school, and although I wasn't thinking about making a living or getting a pay cheque, I already knew I was going to play music all my life."],"Nils-Axel Morner":["You frighten a lot of scientists. If they say that climate is not changing, they lose their research grants. And some people cannot afford that; they become silent, or a few of us speak up, because we think that it's for the honesty of science, that we have to do it.","The late 20th century sea level rise rate lacks any sign of acceleration. Satellite altimetry indicates virtually no changes in the last decade.","It has been popular to threaten 'small islands and low-lying coasts' with scenarios of disastrous future flooding. The Maldives has been the most utilised target. We have undertaken a careful analysis of actual sea level changes in the Maldives. No rise has been recorded either in the present or the past centuries.","All handling by IPCC of the Sea Level questions have been done in a way that cannot be accepted and that certainly not concur with modern knowledge of the mode and mechanism of sea level changes.","Geologists don't do that! We go out in the field and observe, and then we can try to make a model with computerization; but it's not the first thing.","The sea is not rising. It hasn't risen in 50 years."],"Nimrat Kaur":["I have no plan. I will leave it to the good things and good times to find me.","I am a pretty emotional person. Any act of kindness or unkindness moves me. When I see a romantic couple sitting by the beach, it moves me. I don't break down or crack under pressure, but I am just sensitive.","Once while vacationing at my grandparent's house in Rajasthan, we were sleeping on the roof and I spotted an object hovering around in the sky - kind of a UFO. It totally spooked me out. I couldn't sleep for days after that.","Nothing in my background has anything to do with films. In that sense, I am a complete outsider.","Things culminate when they have to. Work comes to you when you deserve to do it.","My dad was in the Indian Army. He died in a terrorist attack in Kashmir in 1994. After that, my mum and I settled in Noida. I went to Delhi Public School in Noida and then to Shri Ram College of Commerce in Delhi University. It was in college that I realised I wanted to be on the stage and in front of the camera.","I like to be prepared enough to be completely unprepared. I don't know if I make sense, but I have a fantasy of living someone else's life. And to do that perfectly, I need to prepare myself just as properly.","Someone very important once told me, 'You can make almost everything look great.' That's the best compliment I have received till date.","I opt for clothes that complement my body type. I am not someone who will go for something just because it is trendy and not look good on me. I would choose clothes which are comfortable and accentuate my body type.","As an actor, there are many confusing factors that can make you take or not take a decision. It becomes difficult. Your first and last checkpoint should be the story. I always read a script as an audience.","'The Lunchbox' has been a blessing - all gift-wrapped and tied with a bow. Life is a lunchbox of chocolates now!","These are stories you hear... of people sitting in a mall and being spotted, and you think it will happen to you. And when you're fresh off the boat, and new in Bombay, you want those kind of things! They are magical fables. You want to, somewhere, be a part of it, something people will read about. But reality is different.","I love to sing. I never had any formal training. My mother is a singer, and I picked up listening to her.","I love cooking, and I can make real good rajma chawal. It is a time consuming process and only for the consumption of a select few very special people. Also, I can make delicious mutton biryani, but I must confess I have stolen the recipe from my mother.","I don't go out with random people.","Films are a whole new world that I'm excited to explore. But being on stage is very close to my heart; it has given me a sense of belonging. I will always try to find a way to balance both.","An army environment is very protected, a walled city kind of environment, where everybody has the same income, you have the same birthday parties, you are given return gifts - everything is the same. Everybody is moving up at the same pace.","Performing arts was something I was always part of. That was may be the only common thread that ran throughout my education, throughout my schooling years. But apart from that, there were no friends or no long term associations. That was the only thing I knew was with me wherever I went.","It is fashionable to be a college dropout, no? Like Steve Jobs.","Anytime I have communicated with college-going people, fresh out of college, looking for a job - money is very important, that is just so important. What is not important is how do you plan to live your life or the larger picture. Not that I had such philosophical intentions when I was 18, but I think there was lesser importance for money.","I like the idea of not having a definition of love and romance. The greatest love stories have been about people who haven't come together. More stories like that need to be explored.","I run on the beach in the mornings. I've also immensely enjoyed CrossFit with Dheepesh Bhatt.","I would've done anything to work with Satyajit Ray.","I want to learn how to boil milk. I somehow manage to over-boil and waste it consistently."],"Nina Agdal":["If something is meant to be, then it will be.","I surround myself with positive, happy people. And I always try to balance things that I have to do with things that I want to do.","My ideal Friday and Saturday evening would be... Friday to go out and have dinner with my girlfriends. Saturday night, I would stay in. I would have somebody cook for me out there because I do not cook very well.","I always try and have a snack before an event - usually a small bowl of chickpea pasta, which is quick to make and delicious with just salt and pepper and a little bit of butter.","I'm all about first impressions, so I love a guy who looks good and walks in with some confidence. That starts with a clean-shaven face and a great smile that'd I'd like to get close to.","I grew up in Denmark and was fortunate enough to have access to good schools and thoughtful teachers.","I actually love spinning for relaxation and to keep my body healthy, but besides that, I love exploring new restaurants.","It's important to protect your skin in the sun.","In general, I can't stand people who always turn a conversation into something about them. I can't stand it when people are too into themselves.","My dream date would be a hike through the woods followed by an outdoor picnic followed by a glass of wine at sunset. Heaven!","I make egg whites... that's about it.","I bike everywhere. It's a good workout, and it's so much fun.","I'm not embarrassed that I'm a fan of Justin Bieber.","I love being outdoors. I love just spending time in the sun and hanging out with my friends.","I love a confident guy and a guy that makes me laugh and who is a little hard to get.","You can't really fake confidence.","I grew up very active, and my parents made me try every single sport there was.","I wish I loved to run, because I'd love to run through Central Park or on vacation on the beach, but I absolutely hate it.","I always tell myself, 'There are so many things you regret doing or eating, but you never regret a workout.' I always feel better after a workout. I have more energy, and mentally, I'm in a better place.","I personally love working out, but I always try to switch it up.","I do wear makeup when I work out. I am one of those people.","I'm always trying to do something active because I love it.","Michael Phelps is a beast. He's like a human fish.","I do Y7 Yoga; I take a lot of Akin's Army classes, soul cycle, boot camps, tone house, SLT, boxing. I do everything.","I eat a lot of Greek yogurt with honey, a lot of lean protein, vegetables.","I'm not gonna lie: I'm kinda the worst with a diet.","When I have a really big shoot, I start thinking about the calories and how much I'm eating compared to how much I'm working out.","English was my worst subject in school.","I like people who can make fun of themselves, who don't take themselves too seriously.","I think Danish girls might be a little more chill - at least, that's what I've heard from people who've also dated American girls.","I love a confident guy with smooth skin... such a turn-on!","What you sweat is what you get.","I don't think I read an entire book in high school.","Who doesn't want that salty beach hair?","I'm from Denmark, so I like to support the Danes.","If I had a shoot the next day, I would definitely try to cut down on the salt because that's really bad for bloating, and you want to look fresh.","I make sure to eat lots of lean protein.","People think that models don't eat. We do eat. Or at least I do. I just work really hard to stay in shape.","I think Dwyane Wade is really a wonderful guy.","I'm a really good shooter, three-point shooter. I'm good at defense. Dribbling, not so much.","Heidi Klum really created something for herself. She is a personality, a model, an entrepreneur. She has a TV show. She's a designer. She's doing a lot of great things. I think she's pretty smart.","I think love just happens.","I feel like people see me as this girl next door, and that comes across in my photos.","I want girls to be able to relate to me, and I think that's why a lot of commercial clients like me: because I'm just like everyone else.","The first place I went in America was Boca Raton, and I thought it was awesome. It was spring break, and there were tons of young people and cute Americans in Speedos.","I am really good at saving my money... I want, like, 100 kids, so I'm going to have to save a lot of money for that.","There have been times when people have told me to lose weight or tone up certain areas... It hurts no matter who you are and how skinny you are or how big you are.","If somebody tells you to lose weight, it is like a punch in the face.","Love me some oysters. I always try them in different countries and cities.","Denmark's fall and winter were really cold and long, actually, but my job often takes me to paradise, so I can't complain.","Who doesn't love snuggling to bed?","I moved from Denmark to America. I left my family. I left my school. I left my friends. And it was basically to pursue my career, and I didn't know if it was going to work out. So that was very scary to leave everything and just put everything into a whole new thing where you don't know if you're going to make it or not. But I think I'm doing good.","I shot a lingerie campaign in Munich once during the winter, and it was actually snowing. At one point, my body literally turned blue, and we had to stop for 20 minutes to get my temperature back to normal. I kept telling myself, 'Try not think about the cold,' but that's extremely hard when you feel like your toes are about to fall off.","I usually work out around six times a week, but if I have the 'Swimsuit' issue, I'll work out seven times a week.","Vimmia is my new favorite thing. I absolutely love the fabric. I do a lot of high-intensity workouts, so the clothing is perfect for that.","You can't take yourself too seriously with anything.","Miami's great. I love going there for a weekend of fun.","On a scale of 1-10, I would consider myself an 8.5 rowdy. I prefer being rowdy in the day. I'm a 10 day rowdy, 7 night rowdy.","I mix up my workouts to make sure I get cardio, toning, and strengthening covered.","If you're dehydrated, you will automatically lose the glow in your skin.","I try to always take off makeup. But I'm also human, and sometimes I get lazy. However, I do try to encourage people to make it a habit.","To me, having a good brow is very important because it is what frames the most important feature on you: your eyes.","I prefer to keep my face as clean as possible when I am not working.","Guys may feel spray tanning is taboo and think it's a girl thing, but you look better with it, so why wouldn't you do it?","If you want a really good tan, you should start with a spray tan, then move into the sun for a little bit.","I never really understood why guys wear boxers underneath swim trunks.","If you feel like an idiot wearing neon yellow shorts, you shouldn't wear them.","I strongly believe that education is a human right and that it's extremely valuable, no matter where you live in the world.","I wouldn't be who I am and where I am today if it wasn't for years of education.","A regular workout for me is 30 minutes of intense cardio followed by lifting weights.","Bring a workout DVD with you everywhere. I always have one in my bag.","Overall, I try to have five small meals a day to keep my metabolism up.","I always have either nuts, Luna bars, or fruit in my bag. A pack of instant oatmeal is also good to carry because it's a quick, nutritious meal you can make almost anywhere.","I think planks and crunches are an old-school simple move, but it's the way to go.","From my childhood, my mom always told me to stay pretty clean and not put anything on my skin. That definitely helped me because I never wear too much makeup.","I think that it's all about finding that confidence in you. If you don't feel like you have it, figure out what's making you unhappy - whether it's your surroundings, your job, whatever it is. Go out and change it.","Obviously, keeping yourself healthy and fit will make you feel better. But you don't have to be a certain size. You don't have to look like anyone else.","I don't really like blush, but I like bronzer from Nars.","When I work out in the morning, I go bare-faced. I do spinning, and it's dark in there anyway, so no one sees you. If it's after work, I remove whatever's on my skin from the day.","For me, working out is to zone out and just be you. Who cares what you look like?","Everyone always says my hair smells good, and I really just use Garnier Fructis conditioner.","If you're stressed out by someone, or if something is dragging you down, it will show on your skin.","If I want to detox, I'll do the juicing thing for sure. I'll have two juices and then a solid meal for either dinner or lunch.","I'm really into boxing - I have a personal boxing trainer in New York.","I try to always work with the same hair and makeup people, so they're my friends, and that makes the process so much more fun.","When I do my own hair, I love Oribe Texture spray and Redken dry shampoo whenever I'm in a rush. It gives it texture and makes it look clean!","My pre-game before an event is to take a steam and a long hot shower before prepping my skin.","I do a bunch of Y7 yoga, which is amazing because it's dark, and nobody's judging you.","Everywhere else in the day, my brain is in a thousand different places, but when I'm working out, I can only focus on the pain.","Don't overdo it. If you're doing a strong lip, keep the eyes simple, and the other way around.","Ain't nobody got time for crusty lips.","Keep your face clean. I don't believe in using too many products. I think that confuses your skin.","My mom actually arranged for all my friends and I to have a makeup tutorial when we first started wearing makeup. That way, we learned how not to do our makeup.","Sometimes less is more when it comes to workout routines.","I get into a zone, so if I start my day healthy, I'm going to eat clean all day. But if I start my day with an egg sandwich, you can bet I'm gonna mess it all up.","I just support people that truly believe that all women are beautiful.","At the end of the day, there should be no judgment or body shaming on anyone.","Instagram is a perception game.","I'm not good at dressing myself; I need people to help me do that.","If I'm dancing, I'm definitely not wearing heels. I just don't love wearing heels. I feel it's just a thing you have to do to keep it sexy or whatever, but I really don't enjoy it. I just love wearing a sneaker."],"Nina Arianda":["My favorite place to vacation is anyplace by the ocean.","I try not to put my purse on the floor - demons will get into it.","I've had a very supportive mother my entire life, so I've had strong women around me.","If I'm having a bad day in rehearsal, I'll sleep with my script.","When I was a kid, my daily routine was playing make-believe, and I kind of created these stories throughout the day. And when it came time to go to preschool, my English wasn't really so great because my mother wanted me to learn Ukrainian, so she signed me up for these children's theater groups.","Before I left for Germany, I had gotten accepted to the performing arts high school in New York, which was a big dream of mine. And having to leave that was very sad for me.","Every audition is different, but I get incredibly nervous and insecure and worked up for however long I have to prep - that's when I get to spin. But you're not allowed to spin once you enter the room. Doubt really can't enter the room when you're auditioning - unless it's part of the character.","I got last-minute rush seats to Baz Luhrmann's 'Boheme,' and my favorite singer, Ekaterina Solovyeva, was playing Mimi that day. My face got burned off when she sang the aria 'Donde Lieta Usci.' The woman was technically sobbing and singing opera at the same time. I don't know how you do that.","I can't have white roses. They symbolize death.","I let steam off by watching 'Downton Abbey.'","Going to the theater or having the honor of performing in theater reminds you of your humanity in a very different way. It's a real release and an incredible challenge. But the stage is a dangerous place. You gotta be trained. Plus, crowds like when things go wrong. I think that's part of the thrill. Anything can happen.","When I was 13, I moved from New Jersey to Germany with my family. The high school was so supportive of my dream to continue with my theater training; instead of taking PE, I would get credit for dance lessons.","Now that I'm on Broadway, it's like NASA engineering with the costumes. I was very grateful for the slightly more high-tech ones in my show, 'Venus in Fur'; our costume designer Anita Yavich is kind of a genius.","I would feel ill without theater. It's kind of a cliche, but every time you make a mistake, you really do have to learn from it to move on. When you're doing something live, there's no time to dwell. Hopefully you'll laugh it off, but if not, you can always take a day to hate yourself.","I don't really know what 'American' is. I know what Ukrainian is. We're happy Slavic people. We're not Dostoyevsky Slavic people. There's this sense of 'pick it up, get your hands dirty, make the best of it, celebrate.'","I never approach a character from a negative place.","I think if you want to get to know me, you should come and see a show. A person might get to see more sides of me.","You leave part of yourself on every stage you're on. How could you not live in the air somehow?","Film is new for me so I'm so fascinated by it and love it, but I would pass out if I could never do theater again. I'd be physically ill!","I see something new in 'Gosford Park' every time I watch it.","I love all things Queen - their songs are epic storytelling.","I'm mildly obsessed with skin care. I do a lot of masks at home, like Elisha Coy's Korean Collagen masks. I also use an embarrassingly wide variety of facial creams.","I was into opera as a kid - I'd play 'Carmen' and sing and dance. My mom signed me up for a theater group before preschool, and I never looked back.","When I won the Tony, I blacked out. I don't remember anything. I had bullet points jotted down, but I forgot to read half of them. My hands were shaking. It was an insane honor to be recognized in that way.","When I was 3, I recited a poem at a festival in Passaic, New Jersey. The applause was tremendous, and it hit me that I could affect people positively by performing.","I had a year at 3 when I wanted to be a conductor in the opera.","What makes an actor, I think, is a combination of a deep curiosity about life and a case of the crazies.","I was a hostess, I sold shoes, but I don't function well in jobs that don't have to do with what I love. I have cleaned bathrooms in theaters, I have sold wine in theaters, I have sold tickets, because I will do anything, anything, to stay in this world.","I'm a real blonde."],"Nina Bawden":["I am not a victim. I am an angry survivor.","People's lives are in the care of the railways when they get on a train. The railways should remember that.","I like stirring the pot - I think it's part of my duty, to shake people up a bit - make them look at things in a different way.","I met my second husband on a bus. We looked at each other and that was it. We were both married to other people at the time and behaved badly, but we didn't seem to have any choice. We were very happy for nearly 50 years and would still be together if it wasn't for the bloody railways.","All writers are liars. They twist events to suit themselves. They make use of their own tragedies to make a better story... They are terrible people.","I like writing for children. It seems to me that most people underestimate their understanding and the strength of their feelings and in my books for them I try to put this right.","The murder of my husband by the railways has altered the way I think about everything. I had always thought that the majority of people were decent and honourable. In the wake of the crash, what made me angry more than anything else was the realisation that this was not true. I still find it very hard to come to terms with.","Children often have a much stronger concept of morality than adults.","I was born in a small suburb of Ilford in a rather nasty housing estate that my mother despised. She had grown up in the country, so when the war came and I was evacuated to Wales she thought I was much better off there.","I wanted to be a war reporter - scrabbling around, exposing things. I didn't want to go to university, I wanted to get a job, but Auntie Beryl said I should go to Oxford.","I've never found it made the slightest difference being a woman - though there is a sort of feeling that as you get older you're not so interesting.","I would hate to live in the country, unless I was living on a farm.","At 11, I passed the scholarship - only just; I wasn't very good at maths - to Ilford County High for Girls. When the Second World War started we were evacuated, first of all to Ipswich, and then to Aberdare, Queen of the Valleys, in south Wales.","I was cleaning out the pigsty at a farm in Wales, where my mother had rented a room, when the results of my final school exam were handed to me by the postman, along with the news that I had a state scholarship to Oxford. I had waited for this letter for so many weeks that I had abandoned hope, deciding that I had failed ignominiously.","Margaret Thatcher was in my year, and our first-year college photograph shows us standing side by side in the back row. We were both grammar school girls on state scholarships.","I met Richard Burton, an RAF cadet on a two-term course. I would have flirted more enthusiastically if it had not been for the horrid boils on the back of his neck.","If you are going to make companies, corporations, actually responsible for the safety of other people's lives, then if they fail in their duty, the only thing to prevent them failing in their duty is the fear that they would be put behind bars.","I grew up on a suburban street with lace curtains and dull neighbours, so I made up stories to tell my friend, in which they became serial killers and burglars. She told her mother, who then told mine.","One good reason for writing novels based on your life is that you have something to read in old age when you've forgotten what happened.","People who don't read seem to me mysterious. I don't know how they think or learn about other people. Novels are a very important part of our education.","Life isn't so complicated for children. They have more time to think about the really important things. That's why I occasionally moralise in my children's books in a way I wouldn't dare when writing for adults.","I hope in my books I help children to see their strengths, and show them I have some idea of what they may occasionally be going through. Especially at tricky moments when it is easier to go back and evade things rather than go forwards and confront them.","But I don't write about sex for today's teenagers. Or Doc Martens boots either. I'm more interested in exploring how exactly the world is run, which doesn't really change that much from one generation to another.","Adults get more confused by social worker jargon. Unlike children, they are also less likely to see two sides of an argument, and they no longer think they can make the world a better place. That can make them rather boring, I suppose.","The train we had so confidently boarded had been speeding at almost 100 miles an hour and it had derailed. Someone, I can't remember who, showed me a newspaper photograph of the carriage we had been sitting in tilted on its side on a station platform next to a large notice that said Welcome to Potters Bar.","I dislike the word 'victim.' I dislike being told that I 'lost' my husband - as if I had idly abandoned you by the side of the railway track like an unwanted pair of old shoes.","Ten thousand pounds is the legal value of a negligently taken life, of a child or a parent. A cold and somewhat mean-spirited calculation: you would do better if you slipped on a paving-stone and broke a front tooth.","There are many times when I think I would have rather died with my husband. It would have been pleasanter, simpler. But it would have been worse for the children and the family in general."],"Nina Blackwood":["I am like the little rock n' roll backseat driver.","Absolute 80's is three hours of mainstream 80's music. I also do New Wave Nation that is more cutting edge. It is more punk stuff from the 70's to the 90's.","Now that the 90's are over and more time has gone by, the 80's sound fresh again.","I grew up in Ohio, and I was a musicologist since I was little; it is all that I would ever read.","When you are young your imagination is so clear.","We put all these things together into a tangible product that is The Rock N' Roll Mystery Tour.","I have two syndicated radio shows though United Stations Radio Network.","I was in the pilot for Spinal Tap before it was a movie.","Christopher Guest movies are my top of the line favorites.","I could not do the film Spinal Tap because I was already at MTV and it was occupying all my time.","I get real excited when I hear my shows on the radio.","I worked with three people who were doing video music shows before MTV.","First of all, you needed a budget to do the video. The record companies would pick and choose who got videos.","The heyday of video music was the mid 80's.","Interviewing people is pretty natural for me.","I am a curious person and, believe it or not, I really do like to sit back and listen to people's stories.","My reading is always about musical biographies. I have an innate interest and passion for that.","The hardest and worst interview that I have ever done was with Frank Zappa.","When I worked for Entertainment Tonight I got to emcee Paul McCartney's press conference.","People that really know me will tell you that I am not a video vixen.","Because I was the blonde, I was promoted as the video vixen.","The thing that they were more freaked out was that I had done a spread for Playboy years before, and as Playboy always does, they exploit the exploitation and re-release different pictures.","I'm a little bit to the left of things anyway."],"Nina Conti":["Having a puppet is a way of having opposing opinions - I say a thing; he says the other.","I could never be on stage on my own. But puppets can say things that humans can't say.","My puppets are far more liberated than I am. Ventriloquism is a useful way of expressing myself.","The character of the monkey just grew from something out of his face and my granddad's personality. They fused, and that's what I ended up with! The monkey belonged to a friend of mine, and I saw that it had such a little beguiling face and it grew from there.","I think I've got it pretty easy compared with somebody who works at a desk nine to five. I'm just working for an hour in the evening. I get a bit breathless, as I have to talk non-stop because of the puppets.","I thought people would think I only wanted to be an actor because my dad was, rather than because I had an innate calling.","When I'm gigging, there's an uneasy shift when I pull a puppet out. People look at me aghast and I feel I have about 20 seconds to win them over. You even get the prejudice among other people in your own profession.","I was really awful at auditions. There's something about sitting down and saying into the camera: 'I'm Nina and this is the name of my agent.' That makes me just die inside.","I don't want to tie myself into one area or the other. I think its important not to rely heavily on either TV or stand-up, but to let them work off of each other.","The most satisfaction I get is from doing a good gig, which really makes you feel in control. If you've worked a room really well, it makes you feel great. TV is a bit more difficult; there are more factors that can screw it up along the way.","I will remember the night I won the New Comedy Awards, as I was young and unformed, so that sticks in the mind. I've also done a fantastic gig at the Royal Albert Hall, which was amazing. Appearing in the Christopher Guest film was also a real highlight, even if I was only in it for a couple of minutes.","I do laugh when I hear myself saying, 'I am a ventriloquist.' I am definitely suited to it, though. I took it and ran with it quite hungrily. It is not for everyone, but it is just the chance to write for a character.","So many actors are lively-minded, creative people who just tread water in this awful way, waiting for the phone to ring and doing their hair for auditions. It feels like a bit of a dreamer's life - as opposed to a sensible ventriloquist's life.","If I have a gig in the evening, I get 'the doom' at about 5 P.M., when I think I'm getting flu.","Acting is seductive. It looks so much fun. I did dally with other things. I did pupillage in a law firm, but I didn't like the look of how many files the lawyer I was working with had to take home every night. It looked like a hideous amount of work, when actors were having nice lunches and discussing books.","I'm training to become a giggle doctor. It's a kind of hospital clown who changes the atmosphere on the ward and helps recovery. It's about making patients laugh but also much more.","I always said I wanted to be scientist, but I didn't really have the staying power.","I had a terrible dream when I was pregnant; I dreamt the baby had a ventriloquial mouth, but there was no hand hole; I had to flick the mouth down to get words out.","I like my squishy, red, high-heeled Vivienne Westwood jelly shoes. They make you seem like you're much more of a go-er.","My dad is a much more flamboyant character than I am. I think that's why I couldn't see myself going into straight acting. I always just felt daft.","I've started running three or four times a week, which prompts millions of sketch ideas.","Once I'm on stage, there's just no time for a sip of water - I've always got my hands in puppets! My voice is raw by the time I finish.","If I'm on my own, I'll speak to 'Monkey' to generate new stuff for the act. I mean, I don't do it for moral support, although I wouldn't say that's out of the question. In fact, I could do it, I might do it... yes, I think I should actually start doing it more.","I looked into studying psychoanalysis, wrote to the governing body and was about to start the year where they psychoanalyse you, four times a week, before you get to do it yourself. I just thought I'd taken the ventriloquism as far as I could. My act is so deconstructive, and I'd made all the monkey jokes anyone wanted to hear.","With acting, I always felt like I didn't have control of it. It was all about other people giving me a job.","I think acting is overrated. I'm not sure I enjoyed it. You never get to write your own roles. It's wonderful for some people, but I found it nerve-wracking. I was too busy worrying that no one would give me their words to speak.","I make napkins talk in restaurants, socks talk on car journeys. There is an awful lot of puppetry going on in the house.","I feel Scottish when with English people, and when I'm with Scottish people, I realise I'm English.","Because I'm around comedians all the time, in my downtime I tend not to watch comedy. Something the whole family enjoys is 'You've Been Framed!' It satisfies all of us. It's universal, and we all laugh a lot.","It's sad, the lottery. Good projects get funded by it, but there's an air of desperation about it.","The way I talk to the puppets is real, and it's in the moment, and it's seeing what will happen. It's not something that is scripted."],"Nina Dobrev":["Even though you're growing up, you should never stop having fun.","I like to keep some things to myself, because its called a private life, not public.","I've realized skinny isn't necessarily attractive. Guys like girls with curves.","Part of life and part of the enjoyment of life is a croissant and a chocolate cake and eggs and milkshakes and oatmeal. There's so many things, you have to learn to appreciate it all. When I don't eat as much as I should, I'm not fun to be around; I'm fussy.","Even though I'm big on recipes, I love to make up my own dishes and when you take a risk in the kitchen, you learn a lot about food!","If I feel confident wearing something, I think it translates in photographs. It changes my demeanor and posture.","I don't like any kind of negativity. I try to be good to everyone, whether it's a love, a friend, an ex. I'll always try to treat people the way I want to be treated.","The 'Degrassi' producers were very supportive. They sent me flowers when I got 'The Vampire Diaries,' and then as soon as it premiered and got the great numbers that it did, I got another large bouquet of flowers from them.","For like everyday, just kind of hanging out, I love flannels. Part of my closet, there's a whole section of flannels because I love them so much. Slouchy, oversized hats and fedoras. I just got these 2 amazing hats that I really love, blue and gold trim with woven material by D&Y. I love D&Y hats.","Yoga changed my life. Hopefully, it will do that for others.","I've reached a point where I'm comfortable in my own skin, and I do what I need to do, to feel good, but I'm built the way I am. The dancer's feet, the bruises on my legs, they're not going to go away. I think real girls have bruises. Tough chicks get bruised. They get dirty. And they have fun.","Girls' weekend with the 'Vampire Diaries' girls has become a big deal! It's our quality time. It's so much fun to unload and not feel guilty complaining or talking about your insecurities or bonding over things that you thought you were on your own about.","People aren't defined by their relationship. The whole point is being true to yourself and not losing yourself in relationships, whether romances or friendships.","There's just something about vampires that's sexy. It's the same reason why women go for the bad boy - you want them but you shouldn't have them.","My whole mentality is that I eat what I want within moderation, and I have a little bit of everything. If you deprive yourself, you get moody and unhappy, and you have to enjoy life.","Starving to be skinny isn't my thing. When I don't eat, it affects my mood! On-set, I fuel up with small meals and I'm always grabbing high-protein snacks, like almonds. Chai lattes with espresso also keep me going.","I really want to be associated with great projects and character driven projects and films. I have to feed my soul, and keep feeling like an artist and keep being challenged.","I want to open my own yoga studio. Planning construction and looking at properties is fun.","Actually... I'm starting a new thing and rebelling against ridiculously high heels. It's inhumane.","Looking back on high school, I just remember specific scenarios and thinking, wow, that was such a big deal at the time, but right now it feels like it never even happened. So I guess if I can give any advice, I would just say that everything will pass, and it'll feel like it was a big deal over nothing.","My way of discovering of what I like was to create a restaurant list and eat my way through it, and I call it my 'inner fat girl bucket list.'","I have one mascara that I use religiously, and I refuse to try anything else, and if they discontinued it I would probably cry. Cover Girl lash blast, in the orange tube.","Comedy is probably a lot harder for me. Maybe it's because I've been doing drama for so long or maybe it's because... you don't want to search for a laugh; you can't try to be funny, you just have to naturally be funny or be in a situation that's funny.","My love can't be purchased... Best gifts have been well-thought-out surprises.","I've always dreamed of being a 'Burberry Girl', but know it'll never happen, because I'm not British. Still, you can't stop a girl from dreaming. And owning way too many Burberry coats!","Whether it's a bright shoe or a clutch or a lipstick, I've had a lot of fun using color contacts as an accessory.","I want to go to Harry Potter Land! I actually should text Emma Watson to see if she can hook us up with a backstage pass or something. That's the perk of doing a movie with Emma called 'The Perks Of Being A Wallflower.'","I have a giant baking book, so I close my eyes and pick a random page. Whatever it is, I try to bake it!","I'm kind of a globetrotter. I've been traveling since I was born and living in different locations.","I try to eat healthy.","I haven't personally in my real life had many people close to me die, but my characters have, and I've had to live that as though it's real. And it can take a really big emotional toll on someone.","To be honest with you, I literally don't even know how to style my hair unless I'm doing an event because I rely on hair stylists.","I mean, I love to try and cook. I'm pretty good, but I'm not saying I'm great.","Over the holidays is when I have the most occasions to cook and bake.","I was kind of a jock in school. Beauty wasn't something I spent a lot of time on.","There's nothing worse than sleeping in makeup. You wake up looking like a painting that's been left out in a rainstorm.","I try not to read best-dressed lists or anything like that.","I think you have to draw from any character and bring it to yourself as much as possible.","I literally pass out when I see blood.","I mean everybody's got ex-boyfriends and girlfriends. Everybody's got baggage.","I know a lot of people dread going to work every morning, but my work is playing pretend and doing stunts and screaming. It's a lot of fun and I get to play dress up. Every day is exciting and different and new and cool. I couldn't be more grateful.","To be honest, I don't watch a lot of TV. It's kind of ironic because I'm on TV.","Even though my grandparents live overseas and are so far away and we talk as much as we can, we don't see each other that often.","I'm constantly trying to make myself better, to learn more. I didn't finish college, so I feel like I'm always having to prove myself. I don't want to feel like the smallest person in the room.","You either have chemistry or you don't, but a lot of what attracts me is a guy's mind and humor and talent. I need to get to know all those things before I fall for someone.","I'm progressive in some ways, old-fashioned in others. I like it when guys hold the door open and are sweet and thoughtful.","A man in a suit looking put together and dapper is very attractive, but I also kind of like the I-just-rolled-out-of-bed, a-little-bit-of-scruff, effortless, not-trying-hard-but-still-sexy guy. If a guy spends more time looking in the mirror than I do, that's problem!","I have a flat tummy, but I'm not rock hard. If I'm going to be in a bikini, I'll train more and skip desserts for a couple of weeks. But usually, I work out to feel good.","Exercising gives me endorphins and energy. I do it four days a week.","Running is my solo time; working my muscles outside in fresh air is therapeutic.","It's just a great brand with great clothes. I'm just excited they asked me to be part of Penshoppe.","I am a fan of the vampire shows, especially 'True Blood.' I'm obsessed with it. I got to meet the entire cast at Comic-Con and hang out with them. And that was awesome. I basically died and went to heaven.","I read the 'Twilight' books before the movie and the whole craze happened. And then I loved it. I was in love with Edward before every other girl that says she's in love with him was. Because I read them a long time ago shooting a movie in Salt Lake City, and one of Stephenie Meyer's friends said, 'Make sure you read my friend's book.'","The 'Degrassi' producers were very supportive. They sent me flowers when I got 'The Vampire Diaries,' and then as soon as it premiered and got the great numbers that it did, I got another large bouquet of flowers from them. Every time I go back to Toronto, I see them and hang out with them.","I try not to read best-dressed lists or anything like that. For every good thing, there will often be a not-so-nice thing people would say.","I do a lot of yoga. I practice yoga three or four times a week. It's an escape for me.","I could be a yoga instructor. I'm not certified, but I could do it. Once I did a class where the instructor didn't show up, and I just went to the front and did it, and everyone followed. So I've done it before, and I love it.","Cole Haan is like high fashion Nike, so you feel like you're wearing Nike shoes, but you're wearing heels. Every time I'm on a red carpet, I always either wear Cole Haan or Stuart Weitzman. You end up having to walk around all night in these heels and you want to be comfortable and not look like you're in pain. It definitely shows in pictures.","I love yoga because it's very calming for your body and your spirit. It gives you that meditative state, and its 90 minutes where you can get away from the world and just be, and exist in the moment. I need yoga. It's part of my life, and I can't imagine not doing it.","When I work out, I feel happy, confident, and accomplished.","When I fly, I never check my bags. I bring a carry-on, an eye pillow, noise-canceling headphones, a big pillow and a blanket.","Yoga changed my body 100 percent. It tones everything and leans you out. Dancer's pose is amazing. It works every muscle!","Savasana is the easiest and most important yoga move because it's so simple. Lying there is meditative.","I love fashion, and I love clothes, and so collaborating and putting pieces together is a passion that I have.","Wash your face at the end of the night! There's nothing worse than sleeping in makeup. You wake up looking like a painting that's been left out in a rainstorm.","Every woman wants and needs different things. It's always best when you're honest and you speak up. It's hard to read minds.","I'd like to try different genres: comedy, period drama, rom-com, action.","I love to try and cook. I'm pretty good, but I'm not saying I'm great.","After going to Australia, it's hard to go anywhere after that. I want to move there. I'm obsessed with it.","I was a rhythmic and athletic gymnast for a little while. Then, when I quit gymnastics, I fell in love with yoga. So sometimes I think I'd like to open up a yoga studio.","When we do get a little time off, I tend to watch movies, go to dinners, and keep it low-key.","I'd love to hear what confident, intelligent women in the industry have to say: Rachel McAdams, Carey Mulligan, Angelina Jolie, Kristen Wiig and Tina Fey. I would stand in line all day for that panel.","I went on a date once with a police officer, unbeknownst to me. I thought he was a regular guy. And when I found out that he was a police officer... I wasn't so into it. I got paranoid that I would illegally cross the street and get a ticket for jay walking.","In my day-to-day life, I'm kind of a tomboy. I like being comfortable.","I'm like the female version of George Clooney in 'Up in the Air.' I have to have an eye mask, and Amore Pacific has this cream face mask that's moisturizing. Moisture is so important in the stuffy, dry air on a plane.","I love cheeseburgers and chocolate - milk, not dark, and hot chocolate with marshmallows in the winter!"],"Nina Easton":["Great leaders don't rush to blame. They instinctively look for solutions.","Sea World's killer whale collection needs constant replenishing. The average life span of the animals in captivity is less than half the average for killer whales in the ocean.","The guardians of your company's cyber security should be encouraged to network within the industry to swap information on the latest hacker tricks and most effective defenses.","The pact creating a North American free-trade zone was President Bill Clinton's signature accomplishment; but NAFTA is also the bugaboo of union leaders, grassroots activists and Midwesterners who blame free trade for the factory closings they see in their hometowns.","To avoid becoming chronically unemployed, people need more than platitudes offering sympathy. Career reinvention requires encouragement and guidance.","Adoption should be an empowering option for young women in crisis, knowing that the people around them - family, friends, church - will respect their choice.","Government pensions, built into law and mostly protected from stock market vagaries, are the envy of the private sector.","When I visited the Water Institute's Baton Rouge offices overlooking the Mississippi River, I couldn't find a drop of the charged politics that drives so many environmental conversations in Washington.","In the new economy, we all have to be entrepreneurs with our own lives - with all the rewards and risks and, yes, anxieties that entails.","Globalization is stirring widespread economic anxiety, and middle class incomes have stagnated while a class of super-rich has emerged.","In 1992, Bill Clinton ran on a platform of 'ending welfare as we know it.' His political worldview, drawn from like-minded thinkers at the Democratic Leadership Council, was based in private sector growth and personal responsibility.","Your company is probably going to get hacked. The velocity and complexity of hacking attempts has skyrocketed, with companies routinely facing millions of knocks on the vault door.","Direct mail was the basis of a lot of new Right organizations in the '70s and early '80s, and it actually led to the downfall of the majority of them. It's very expensive, and you end up putting your organization more and more in debt if you're not successful with it.","I always thought that Grover Norquist had a - he really is a true ideologue, in every sense of the word.","Ralph Reed is deeply ambitious and always was so. There was a time when he... in one of my interviews, he said he pondered running the Ross Perot campaign, and he wasn't sure he wanted to do the Christian Right thing; he was worried that it boxed him into a corner.","I think the danger with the liberal Left is seeing the Republican Party as a monolith.","If you want to know how Hillary Clinton could try to distance herself from President Obama's much-criticized foreign policy, listen closely to the words of her former top strategist, Anne-Marie Slaughter.","In May 2007, congressional Democrats and the Bush administration agreed to a plan to include environmental and international labor standards in upcoming trade agreements.","In 1996, Bill Clinton declared the era of big government over in the State of the Union address.","If you like Obama, if you like a Washington that offers free stuff and taxing the rich, that's what you get. I don't see him evolving as a president.","The discovery of heroes is rarely linear or obvious. They usually sneak up on you.","Public anger over bank bailouts was as much about fairness as the billions of dollars spent.","One of my most vivid memories from 1974 was the gas station at the foot of the hill below my Southern California high school - car lines snaking out into the street, heralding the failure of the government's price controls and lame ideas such as odd-even rationing.","We know that inflation distorts economic behavior. In the 1970s, a combination of high tax rates and inflation prompted investors to flee production in favor of protection.","Modern Americans - shaped by raucous politics and a rapacious media - like to think of themselves as experts in confronting mistakes.","Reality shows serve up juicy drama out of human shortcomings.","Our pride is tied up in being right. We tend to favor data that confirm our beliefs, so we don't see alternatives. Too often, leaders practice defense routines that become self-reinforcing.","We like to think that a free market's greatest strength is its self-corrective nature.","Jobless workers, especially those out of work for months and years, don't have the skills to multitask in a fast-paced economy where medical workers need to know electronic record-keeping, machinists need computer skills, and marketing managers can no longer delegate software duties.","Economically, long-term joblessness means fewer dollars for consumption. For deficit control, it means fewer taxpayers contributing to government revenues and tens of billions more spent on unemployment insurance.","The longer people are unemployed, the less employable they become. Skills become rusty; managers look more suspiciously at someone who has been out of work for years than a candidate already employed.","In the fall of 1996, I sat inside weekly strategy meetings of conservative activists as part of research for my book, 'Gang of Five,' chronicling the rise of the baby-boomer Right.","Anyone who has been around Washington politics long enough can't avoid this truism: Election-year money is like a rushing river that invariably finds cracks in any dam the reformers erect.","The Citizens United ruling did not invent special-interest spending; it enables corporations and unions to advocate directly on behalf of a candidate rather than running more subtle 'issue ads.'","Scratch the surface at conservative think tanks and universities that house free-market economists, and it's not hard to find proponents of a carbon tax.","Every journalist loves a peaceful protest -whether it makes news, shakes up a political season, or holds out the possibility of altering history.","A huge segment of the country has always felt overtaxed. In 1938, when taxes were roughly 17% of income, a 'Fortune' survey found that nearly half of all Americans thought they paid too much relative to what they got in return.","Successful candidates follow a simple fundamental rule: Define yourself before your opponent can define you.","Trying to decipher where President Obama really stands on free trade can be like trying to trace the U.S.-Mexico border with a Google map. There are words, and there are actions - but there is mostly that long squiggly line in between.","A desire to rescue secular America from fallen grace has driven conservative evangelicals at least since the 1970s, when Jerry Falwell formed the Moral Majority as a vehicle for conservative Christians to muscle their way into national politics.","The mission of Patrick Henry College was to attract and cultivate academic stars from the ranks of home-schooled evangelicals, then send them off on graduation day to 'shape the culture and take back the nation,' in the words of a common home-schooling rallying cry.","We like to think of women as peacemakers, not purveyors of violence.","Presidential coverage used to be a very serious endeavor.","It's really important, whether you're a conservative or a liberal, to always challenge the conventional wisdom, which is what I've tried to do in all my work.","I've made decisions along the way so I would be there for my kids, and it's kept me from going places I would have gone.","Unless engineers can stop southern Louisiana from sinking into the Gulf - the Mississippi Delta is the fastest-disappearing land on the planet - even post-Katrina's modernized levees will be overwhelmed.","Message to all you crazed parents desperately hiring tutors and padding your kid's thin resume: Chillax. Attending an elite college is no guarantee of leadership, life success, or earnings potential.","It's true that many of the leaders who started at non-elite colleges as undergrads later attended prominent graduate schools in law, business, medicine, and so on. But the point is that they found their own way there - as young men and women in their early 20s, not teenagers pressed into action by parents and peers.","I've been awed by the incredible opportunities that automatically float to the Harvard undergrads I once taught - from building homes for the poor in Nicaragua to landing prime White House internships.","Birth mothers choose life, and a family, for their child. But this choice is rarely celebrated. Women routinely face family, friends and even health-care providers who think that adoption equals abandonment, according to researchers and conversations with birth mothers.","A woman's decision to carry a baby to term knowing that she will not reap the fruits of motherhood should be treated as an act of bravery and selflessness - the ultimate standards of good motherhood.","A full accounting of adoption as an option would not underestimate its emotional challenges - the grief and loss for birth mothers, the uncertainties for adoptive parents operating under a patchwork of state laws.","Community colleges are popular among political leaders of both parties. But because of the lack of funding and a lack of direction, they have lost their critical edge in preparing workers for a 21st-century economy.","Disability has become a form of permanent welfare for a lot of folks. It's not that hard to prove a mental illness or mental issues or pain issues.","Barack Obama's political roots are liberal, but he has always resisted buying into the brand of liberalism that denigrates American greatness and potential.","We know this much about how Barack Obama plans to govern: He will deploy the fattest checkbook ever at the disposal of an incoming American president.","It's become glib political conventional wisdom in Washington that a massive spending plan will provide a parachute rescue for a cliff-diving economy - landing it safely and with strong enough legs to move toward a healthy future.","Main Street versus Wall Street was the 2008 economic mantra of Democrat Barack Obama.","Presidents can be judged by the company they choose to keep.","The fierce battles between New Democrat centrists and old-style liberals that defined the Democratic Party in the 1990s are long gone, with the party unified behind Barack Obama's economic agenda of universal health care, expensive federal programs and more regulation of the financial markets.","The centerpiece of Obamanomics - raising taxes on high earners and investors and lowering them on the middle class - is attacked by free-marketers for penalizing economic success and possibly further stalling economic growth.","Events like Hurricane Katrina and the Minnesota bridge collapse suggest a national infrastructure that has suffered from lack of tending.","Shamu the killer whale is Sea World's Mickey Mouse; whales named Shamu are the star attractions of three parks and the focus of their marketing efforts.","Fame legitimizes. Being conspicuous gets confused with being illustrious.","'George' exploits John Kennedy Jr.'s cult of celebrity at a time when Americans are hungry for icons, not heroes."],"Nina Fedoroff":["There's almost no food that isn't genetically modified. Genetic modification is the basis of all evolution. Things change because our planet is subjected to a lot of radiation, which causes DNA damage, which gets repaired, but results in mutations, which create a ready mixture of plants that people can choose from to improve agriculture.","In agriculture, people have taken wild plants that can't be eaten by people - and turned them into wonderful food sources. And that's because genomes can change, and people working with plants have picked mutations. Mutations are nothing more than genetic changes.","New molecular methods that add or modify genes can protect plants from diseases and pests and improve crops in ways that are both more environmentally benign and beyond the capability of older methods.","One of the really remarkably beneficial aspects of genetic engineering is that much of the previous methodology for controlling pests and so forth is through chemicals that affect a very broad spectrum of insects, for example, or fungicides that control fungi.","Civilization depends on our expanding ability to produce food efficiently, which has markedly accelerated thanks to science and technology.","Myths about the dire effects of genetically modified foods on health and the environment abound, but they have not held up to scientific scrutiny. And, although many concerns have been expressed about the potential for unexpected consequences, the unexpected effects that have been observed so far have been benign.","If everybody switched to organic farming, we couldn't support the earth's current population - maybe half.","I don't know how you overcome the dearth of scientists in the government positions.","Even as the population doubled from three to six billion, we managed to race ahead with all kinds of technological and scientific events in agriculture - from using more fertilizers to mechanization to advanced plant breeding.","India has the opportunity to be a leader in genetic engineering, It has institutions that no other country has.","We need to continue to decrease the growth rate of the global population; the planet can't support many more people.","There are probably already too many people on the planet.","We wouldn't think of going to our doctor and saying 'Treat me the way doctors treated people in the 19th Century,' and yet that's what we're demanding in food production.","As people around the world become more affluent, they are demanding diets richer in animal protein, which will require ever more robust feed crop yields to sustain.","We are sliding back into a dark era, and there seems little we can do about it. I am profoundly depressed at just how difficult it has become merely to get a realistic conversation started on issues such as climate change or genetically modified organisms.","In the last century, as we learned more about genes, we were able to devise ways of accelerating evolution.","We've gotten so good at growing food that we've gone, in a few generations, from nearly half of Americans living on farms to 2 percent. We no longer think about how the wonderful things in the grocery store got there, and we'd like to go back to what we think is a more natural way.","We have six-and-a-half-billion people on the planet, going rapidly towards seven. We're going to need a lot of inventiveness about how we use water and grow crops.","The influence of a science adviser is only as good as ears open to that science advice.","We have domesticated crops over a very long period of time, like tens of thousands of years. And crops get - seeds get carried. Sometimes, if they're very small seeds, they get scattered off trucks. Pollen travels.","Weeds do become resistant to herbicides, and it needs to be managed with multiple herbicides.","In many places in the developed world, we eat or waste probably twice as many food calories as we really need. We're wasteful of food. We ship all over the world. We're now realizing that generating the energy to ship the food around the world is also ruining our climate.","Jumping genes are fundamental because they're agents of change. Everybody knows that organisms evolve. What makes them evolve is that their genes are dynamic and in motion. A familiar example is the stripe-y corn - called Indian corn - that you buy in the fall.","If there are more and more environmental refugees, they are going to end up on your doorstep too.","The more we can grow on already cultivated land, the better."],"Nina Garcia":["If you look back in history of the women who are most memorable and most stylish, they were never the followers of fashion. They were the ones who were unique in their style, breakers of the rules. They were authentic, genuine, original. They were not following the trends.","'Style Strategy' is about shopping smart, staying chic and making it all last. It's about showing women how to shop for value without compromising style.","Putting on fierce boots is an instant pick-me-up.","I'm a real believer in dressing tone-on-tone. I'm not saying you need to dress black. Dress just one color so the colors are not breaking your silhouette.","It's refreshing to see a woman who can artfully weave her individuality into an otherwise safe ensemble.","I do not do selfies! That's a tough one because I don't do selfies, but I think it's all about personal style. The more outrageous, the better.","One of the most magical places on Earth is a small island in the Caribbean called Mustique. With brilliant beaches, warm water, and lush vegetation, this tiny green swath of land is my idea of paradise.","Invest in a couple of really good things - a great, classic coat; a good pair of shoes; and a timeless bag - then fill in the gaps with lower-priced pieces.","I'm all about the high heel; I think it's the sexiest accessory ever made, including lingerie.","You can find a mentor; you have to ask questions, you have to show interest in what the other person is doing. You have to have curiosity - I think that people appreciate that and will want to help you.","Don't be afraid to mix things up by pairing a military-style jacket with a velvet skirt, vintage with modern, off-the-rack with couture, formal with casual.","Style is about fun. True style is not about having a closet full of expensive and beautiful things - it is instead about knowing when, where, and how to utilize your collection.","Style is really very personal. It's kind of timeless. Style is really about how you put yourself together. It's something very personal.","I grew up with a fashion-obsessed mother and an older sister, so there was a lot of fashion in my house. The first thing I remember owning was a Pierre Cardin jumpsuit when I was 9 or 10; of course I didn't actually buy it, but I fell in love with it.","My aspiration was always to be a fashion editor.","If you invest in something a little more expensive with longevity, you'll use it more.","If my closet were burning, it'd be my collection of jackets I would save - they always make me feel pulled-together.","I happen to have an obsession with Korean food.","I am always being stopped for style advice, and I love it! The way we dress says so much about ourselves, and I love when I can help others take control of that.","I've said this so many times, but I keep coming back to this: Trends come and go. Own them and make them your own. If it doesn't feel right, then don't feel like you need to dress a certain way just to be trendy.","I lived in South America when I was growing up. I spent hours sketching. I was good at drawing, and I was obsessed with fashion, but I was also obsessed with magazines.","After assessing what's in your closet, make a list of what you need. Not want, but need. Write down the basics missing from your wardrobe. It could be a classic white shirt, a trenchcoat, or the perfect little black dress. Whatever the blank spots, write them down. This will be your reference for shopping.","My six favorite textures for fall and winter are leather, fur, tweed, mohair, velvet and wool. I love that they are all as warm as they are fashionable and easy to incorporate into your wardrobe.","In Colombia, where I was born and raised, women like my mother considered their appearance and personal grooming a matter of principle. There was never an occasion where she didn't show up looking picture-perfect.","I'm a big believer that accessories can make or break a look.","Like most people, I've grown a lot more sophisticated in my style choices. I know myself and what suits me better now than I did when I was much younger and feel more comfortable in my own skin.","I've always been opinionated, unfortunately, to my mother's disappointment.","Taking stock of what you own, when done correctly and thoroughly, helps dampen the urge to shop frivolously.","My style is about making things last forever. When you're on a budget, it can be daunting to spend $300 on a pair of boots or a coat. But such basics are the building blocks from which your look is crafted.","We all get a little rush of excitement at the prospect of buying a brand-new outfit for a first date, but this is not the time. You're much better off wearing clothes, shoes especially, that you've already tested.","Nothing is more alluring to a man than a woman who looks good in her jeans.","The fashion editor as it used to be has changed. Now you have to wear many hats, and whoever tells you differently is wrong. Now you're on TV, whether you want it or not.","People always ask me if I could live in any other era what would it be, and I tell them none! I feel so lucky to live in an age where technology has changed and continues to change and make life so much more exciting. It keeps everyone young and constantly learning new things.","I've had to adapt my wardrobe to my various roles, both at the office, as a mom, and for television. When I shop for the season I look for pieces that will suit every facet of my daily life, not just one single occasion.","My nightmare of nightmares is being overdressed for a casual event - I've done it! You have to have a real sense of what you want to communicate.","When I was older and I first started working, I was obsessed with buying my first Chanel jacket. I saved up my hard-earned money, went to Barneys, and bought a little black Chanel jacket. It saw many, many job interviews and many, many events. I'm not fitting into it lately, but I still have it.","I'm very classic and structural. I love clean lines and interesting, modern details. But I'm all about being streamlined - less is more.","I have seen everything possible covered in studs and grommets. Also, what I call angry shoes: those platforms with the multiple buckles and studs. I think the polished girl is back.","I love 'Project Runway' because I can really be of help to an industry and I can be supportive to designers.","For so many years fashion was shrouded in mystery, this glamorous profession that people knew very little about, they thought it was so glamorous. It now has become so available, with the Internet, with shops like H&M and Target that do designer collaborations, so it's more available to everyone and that's created more interest.","My mother was a very big inspiration. She loved fashion. I loved art in school, and I was very good at drawing. I could sit at the table forever and just dream up collections and draw.","Here's the thing: I love what I do for the magazine, and I love what I do on television. When you do the things that you love, it's not bad. It's about being very organized.","I don't have a development deal, but the one thing I have learned is never say never. I will consider things as they come.","It's interesting because we live in a country where the obesity is so enormous. And then the reflection on the runways is girls that are so thin. So there's two extremes that are almost like a reflection of themselves, and it's very hard to be in the middle with girls that are just healthy.","Whenever I'm on a book tour, one of the questions I always get asked is what to wear to various occasions.","My passion for fashion originated in my mother's closet. She was a woman who loved fashion. She enjoyed dressing up a lot, and she had a closet that was like her sacred room that belonged only to her. She wouldn't let us go in and play there very often.","I was born in Barranquilla, Colombia, and I came to attend high school in Massachusetts when I was about 15 years old.","There really are so many lines of work that you can join that don't have to only be design. And that was one that particularly interested me a lot, because the editors could appreciate all the trends, all the designs and all the work of the designers.","I think my Latino culture has equipped me with a different point of view than the rest of my counterparts, and seeing things from a different angle has helped me a lot. I feel very proud of my culture, of my Latino heritage.","I think New York is the center of fashion, even though L.A. has a lot of heritage and the glamour of Hollywood.","When interviewing for any job, you of course want to dress appropriately for the position, but you also want to stay true to who you are.","Don't get me wrong, I love a good cardigan too, but a jacket - especially one with sharp shoulders, interesting buttons, or a unique collar - always looks the most fashion-forward.","I actually started my career interning at Perry Ellis and got to work with Marc Jacobs.","I love shopping for guys! A watch is a fantastic gift idea - an oversized, stainless steel version with links is classic and cool.","Your wardrobe should complement your skill set, never detract - or distract - from your assets.","Serving jury duty is a fascinating little slice of life, with its motley crew of personalities.","I firmly believe that 90 percent of the confusion that women feel when they are attempting to put together an occasion-specific ensemble is caused by fear: fear of breaking the 'fashion rules,' fear of violating some long-forgotten tradition, or the basic fear of looking bad.","Each moment calls for a different stylistic essence and a different sense of impact, and mastery of this balance is an art form - a very learnable art form.","I'm not sure if I can cook. I probably can. But I'm really good at cajoling anybody around me to cook for me.","The best thing about my apartment is that it looks over Oscar de la Renta and all the shops.","I don't ride the subway. Either I walk, or I take a New York City taxi.","I'm really looking to reach any woman who's interested in refining and embracing her personal style.","I'll admit it, the grunge trend doesn't really speak to me. I get why other people like it, but it's just not my style. Don't get me wrong, I love layering, but I like it when it is done with a little more polish and sophistication.","Fashion is an expression of a time, of a place, of history. It's putting things into context.","Fashion is just an interpretation of the culture around us.","I was obsessed with fashion when I was young. I thought fashion meant fashion design, and I thought I wanted to be a designer at some point.","I was so passionate about being in the magazine industry, even when I first started at 'Mirabella.'","When I come home, I need to feel instantly disconnected. In the rest of my life, I feel overstimulated. Here, I want things to be serene and unfussy, full of objects I love - but not too many of them.","I'm all about my rugs. I don't like a lot of color. The apartment isn't exactly monotone, but it's full of very soft shades. So, really, the fun is with the carpets.","I've always spoken my mind. There's no reason not to!","Many of my friends and colleagues are in the public eye, so they have to pay close attention to what they wear. But every woman needs to stay on her toes in this era of cell-phone cameras and Facebook.","As always, work with your figure; draping, pleats, and proportion can work miracles when it comes to hiding flaws and enhancing assets.","Working from home or going on maternity leave is no excuse to let go of your look. The more you schlep around in drawstring pants and tees, the less you're going to be able to pull yourself together when necessary.","What I loved about my partnership with 'Quarterly' was the fact that it bridges the online world with the real world. Sometimes we see these two worlds as separate entities, and to be able to establish a bridge is very exciting.","I tend to wear leather pants with crew neck sweaters or leather jackets with denim.","Sweaters are a closet staple. They look great under a leather vest or with a pair of tailored trousers."],"Nina Hagen":["As long as karma exists, the world changes. There will always be karma to be taken care of.","We can change the world if we change ourselves. We just need to get hold of the old patterns of thinking and dealing with things and start listening to our inner voices and trusting our own superpowers.","Jesus Christ will be the leader of an intergalactic earth evacuation. We're getting some earth leaders up there to check the mother ship. The Bible says that the sky will be glorious and Christ will come back to us all.","Do some selfless service for people who are in need. Consider the whole picture, not just our little selves.","I heard opera all day long. From the time I was 9 years old, I was imitating the singers; later I studied opera. But we also got Western television and radio, from the Americans in West Berlin. When I was 11 years old, I turned into a hippie and gave flowers to policemen. And when I was 21 and left Berlin for London, I became a punk.","It doesn't matter how old people are. It matters if they love each other and have fun with each other. It has nothing to do with age. To get old is a mental disease. Everything is in the head.","I have a wish for world peace and the truth. I would like to see a society that will bring happiness to all life forms. Of course, to the Nazis, I appear a rebel, but to the rebels, I appear like a normal person from Venus.","I never have a bad night, bad day, bad moment.","You see, you learn from all your bad experiences, so they're really positive. It's all part of the cosmic knowing.","I sing about heaven and hell, angels and demons.","I sing about UFOs and extraterrestrials, and so I designed a UFO fashion. It includes science-fiction bikinis and Bermuda Triangle shorts.","I know what's best for me, and I want to do things my way. So, now I listen to my inner voice and my heart - and that's how I make my decisions.","I don't have to try to be outrageous. I am outrageous.","People who are stuck in a Catholic church, that's OK for them because that's what they need right now.","Who are we to judge somebody for who he's allowed to fall in love with?","I was traveling on our tour bus through Europe and I was thinking I want to have long blonde hair.","You have to see my show to believe that I'm the only unique Nina Hagen on this planet.","I have a following. Whenever I am on tour they come. It is always sold out.","I create my own lyrics. I have a great band. I have a drummer from East Berlin.","Life is so great every day. I am telling things every day.","When I was growing up in East Germay, everyone said there was no God. So I started looking for it myself.","I meet many people, I talk with them, like a TV show host. I show what's going on with Greenpeace, interesing political things, I have artists, musicians and bands.","I once had a dream and this one familiar god, who was probably one of my master teachers, said, 'You should not worry about being on the charts. That's not important.'","I have my own strength.","I sing 'All Apologies' with my own lyrics. People want to sing along, but then, oops, they realize it's a different story.","Maybe one day I'll have a big hit, and the world will make a big sex symbol out of me like they always do when there's a new chick.","You don't always have to have a record out. I'm not a sausage factory, you know, turning out records every year.","It wasn't fun to go to school, because we had to wear these blue things around our necks. We had to join the Pioneer Society, and we had to salute with our hands over our eyes. Even then, I was thinking for myself. I thought this wasn't so different from the way the Nazis had conditioned people.","I grew up in East Berlin, in a family of artists.","I screamed and cried, but no one ever came. No doubt it was in one of those scream-filled nights in which my strong singer lungs and my crazy voice were born.","It's a human right to be able to have a relationship.","I am a Love Boat."],"Nina Hoss":["As a kid, I remember crying and then noticing myself in the mirror and being fascinated by how that looked.","In Germany, actors tend to be more laid-back and take orders from the director: 'Tell me what you want.' I'm more into collaboration. So are Americans.","My all-time favorites that I always go back to are films by the director John Cassavetes. The movies he made, the work he left behind, have been a big influence for my work.","I'm not such a fan of the concept of social media, though I don't have anything against it. I still love to call the people I want to be friends with."],"Nina Jacobson":["My daughter and I have this thing we call a PMA: 'perfect moment alert.' I try to really notice when we're having a PMA.","It's definitely a tough blow to your morale to get fired.","I know many filmmakers, and shooting in IMAX is challenging. Filmmakers love the vividness and power of those big images.","The IMAX cameras are big and heavy. And they're loud. So you have to be mindful of whether or not they're worth it; I'd say the image quality is incredible and the scale is amazing.","When I love a book, I really love a book. You don't get that very often.","When you're younger and you see something that really speaks to you, it's indelible in a way that's not the same as when you're an adult. So I'll always love reading books and making movies that resonate with young people.","I've been fortunate enough to match up the material I'm producing with the right buyer, the company that will make it and that wants it, and that isn't saying yes to be nice, but is saying yes because they want and need that movie and it's going to be important on their slate.","Getting movies developed doesn't do me any good as a producer. It only does me good to get movies made.","I think that one of the greatest perspectives that I have, from being a buyer for my whole career until I became a producer, is that I have a pretty good understanding of the buyer's mentality.","Suzanne Collins, it was such a big thing for me to make the handshake with her and to say, 'You can trust me. I will not screw up your books. And I won't let them be diluted and softened. And I won't let them be exploited and made guilty of the sins that are being commented on in the books.' I take that really seriously.","I am happy to keep working on books because I'm always reading, and I'm always trying to fall in love.","There's as much great authorship in the filmmaker community as in the literary community, and I'd love to welcome more filmmakers into the fold.","When doing family entertainment, you don't actually worry about kids. You know what you can't do. But in terms of sensibility and sophistication and wit and ambition, aim for your own taste level, and kids will - if they're interested in the subject matter - be glad that you did.","I think that women are underrepresented behind the camera as directors.","There are still so few female directors. There are far fewer writers than we'd like to see.","Ultimately, I am very filmmaker oriented, as a producer.","When you read a book, you create that tonal bandwidth. You set a tone for yourself, as you're reading it, in which everything exists within the world of your imagination.","I'm very superstitious. I come from a family that's big on not painting the nursery until the baby is home.","Ultimately, only audiences decide what's a franchise."],"Nina Shaw":["Often, when we support the 'right' causes and candidates, we fail to recognize that with progress comes sacrifice. That sacrifice might mean that you are no longer the obvious choice for the job. Your job security may no longer be a given.","So many people don't have control over their destiny in a way that I do, don't own their own businesses, don't have their own clients. I owe it to them to speak freely.","If you want to be a woman in power, then empower other women.","'Black girl magic' means, to me, just getting out there and doing it every day and not letting anything get you down.","Essence has been home for so many of us for so many years. I always say that Essence was the first place that I felt I was a pretty black girl.","You are a much more forceful advocate against gender bias and wage inequality if you actually hire women. If you are a white man who advocates for change, then hire someone other than a white man as an example of that change.","I'm incredibly tenacious, but I also try so hard in my work to really listen to people and address their point of view. In the end, I always remember who I'm an advocate for.","I think it's important to live as much of your life as possible in the real world. If you live a life that's limited to the Westside of Los Angeles, you're only going to see people like you."],"Nina Simone":["The worst thing about that kind of prejudice... is that while you feel hurt and angry and all the rest of it, it feeds you self-doubt. You start thinking, perhaps I am not good enough.","Did you know that the human voice is the only pure instrument? That it has notes no other instrument has? It's like being between the keys of a piano. The notes are there, you can sing them, but they can't be found on any instrument. That's like me. I live in between this. I live in both worlds, the black and white world.","I'll tell you what freedom is to me: no fear. I mean really, no fear!","To me, we are the most beautiful creatures in the whole world. Black people. And I mean that in every sense.","Slavery has never been abolished from America's way of thinking.","Sometimes I sound like gravel, and sometimes I sound like coffee and cream.","You get racism crossing the street; it's in the very fabric of American society.","It's an artist's duty to reflect the times in which we live.","As a political weapon, it has helped me for 30 years defend the rights of American blacks and third-world people all over the world, to defend them with protest songs. To move the audience to make them conscious of what has been done to my people around the world.","I'm not a blues singer, I'm a diva.","I'm a real rebel with a cause.","To most white people, jazz means black and jazz means dirt, and that's not what I play. I play black classical music.","When I'm on that stage, I assume honor. I assume compensation, and I should.","The protest years were over, not just for me but for a whole generation, and in music, just like in politics, many of the greatest talents were dead or in exile, and their place was filled by third-rate imitators.","I didn't get interested in music. It was a gift from God.","Greed has driven the world crazy. And I think I'm lucky that I have a place over here that I can call home.","At this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when every day is a matter of survival, I don't think you can help but be involved.","There's no excuse for the young people not knowing who the heroes and heroines are or were.","I flirt all the time. I like men! I don't think we can do without them.","I want to shake people up so bad, that when they leave a nightclub where I've performed, I just want them to be to pieces.","I think that the artists who don't get involved in preaching messages probably are happier - but you see, I have to live with Nina, and that is very difficult.","I have to be composed; I have to be poised. I have to remember what my first piano teacher told me: 'You do not touch that piano until you are ready and until they are ready to listen to you.","Once I understood Bach's music, I wanted to be a concert pianist. Bach made me dedicate my life to music, and it was that teacher who introduced me to his world.","Jazz is a white term to define black people. My music is black classical music.","I would like a man now who is rich, and who can give me a boat - a sailboat. I want to own it and let him pay for it. My first love is the sea and water, not music. Music is second.","I wasn't a jazz player, but a classical musician, and I improvised arrangements of popular songs using classical motifs.","All the time, there was the weight of my community's expectations on my shoulders.","I don't like rap music at all. I don't think it's music. It's just a beat and rapping.","I think if I were over there in America, protest music would be more important. But I'm not going.","I try to swim every damn day I can, and I've learned to scuba dive and snorkel.","You feel the shame, humiliation, and anger at being just another victim of prejudice, and at the same time, there's the nagging worry that maybe... you're just no good.","I had spent many years pursuing excellence, because that is what classical music is all about... Now it was dedicated to freedom, and that was far more important.","My daughter is in more competition with me. I never wanted to be bigger than my mother or to challenge her.","When I was studying... there weren't any black concert pianists. My choices were intuitive, and I had the technique to do it. People have heard my music and heard the classic in it, so I have become known as a black classical pianist.","I think the rich are too rich and the poor are too poor. I don't think the black people are going to rise at all; I think most of them are going to die.","I think the rich will eventually have to cave in too, because the economic situation around the world is not gonna tolerate the United States being on top forever.","From the beginning, it has been a no-no for a black man to touch a white woman.","Desegregation is a joke.","This may be a dream, but I'll say it anyway: I was supposed to be married last year, and I bought a gown. When I meet Nelson Mandela, I shall put on this gown and have the train of it removed and put aside, and kiss the ground that he walks on and then kiss his feet.","What I was interested in was conveying an emotional message, which means using everything you've got inside you sometimes to barely make a note, or if you have to strain to sing, you sing."],"Nina Tassler":["Throughout my career, the pounding in my heart, the fright, has been ever-present, but I never turned back. Fear can be a highly motivational part of the journey.","I was always a big fan of 'Quincy,' and I loved the idea of puzzle solving.","I think 'destined for greatness,' for me, is digging deep inside and knowing that I will always strive to be the best person I can possibly be and effect change in a positive way.","I think the best voices, the most creative voices, and the best content always wins.","You have to make your decision based on the content.","We always look to add more diverse characters to shows if we feel we haven't delivered.","'Scorpion' has so much humor and so much heart and a great deal of action.","I'm a feminist.","I come from a long line of Democrats.","I was always fascinated by the Torah, the Bible, in terms of story telling: heroes and villains, morality and flaws. There's no better epic. Also, being part Latin and Jewish means I have a sense of the theatrical. There were always a lot of people in my house. My home was always filled with a lot of storytellers.","When I was growing up, the current of feminism was strong. You just had to step off the bank, and you'd be swept up. There was an active women's movement. My mother was a part of it.","I've been blessed to be with my husband since I was 18.","I'm on the board of trustees at Boston University. I'm on the board of trustees at Jewish Family Services.","I'm extremely lucky that I've worked for and with amazing people in my life.","I'd love to see the 'CSIs' run forever.","Nothing runs forever. How you handle it, the most important thing is how you respect your audience, how you respect your cast, and being incredibly sensitive to how you wrap up any show when it ends a successful run.","The audience that watches on Sunday night is upscale, very female, and very engaged.","Any show in its first season goes through multiple changes. There is little or no difference to changing the cast on a talk show.","I have worked in the media/content business my entire life.","'The Talk' is one of the most diverse shows in daytime.","As long as we're monetizing our content... we still win at the end.","The truth is we're all part of one big content universe.","When it comes down to, it's not about the form, it's about the content.","When I was in drama development, you hear anywhere between 500 to 600 pitches a season, and you do feel like you hit the wall. But I will never say, 'No, I won't hear that.'","At the end of the day, it is about doing your best work - controlling what you can control and not trying to control what you can't.","It's about story; it is a social experiment, and people take that into account when they're watching 'Big Brother.'","Without the nontraditional methods we used to promote 'Jericho'... we wouldn't have been able to get the traction we did.","One of the things I learned in college is that if you're going to be late for an audition, don't go.","Tom Selleck is a big draw.","That's what my job is: to create quality programming.","I'm an entertainer.","It's important to me to reach deep into the community and promote Latino artists.","I went through a lot of feelings of self-doubt and loss of self-esteem. I was particularly vulnerable after having my son. It was rough getting back on my feet in the business.","As you continue to work on a show, if I still feel inspired, and I feel they are making exciting choices, then our enthusiasm remains. This is not a perfect science. It's an evolutionary process.","The original 'CSI' grew stronger once the spinoffs became entrenched. Like any good franchise, when there's a great story to be told, viewers can't get enough.","'Without a Trace' analyzes criminal behavior in the special context of a disappearance. We consider it a suspense thriller.","'Criminal Minds' consists of stories told within the framework of the FBI behavioral science unit. It's about serial profiling.","Finding new voices with fresh ideas is the hardest and most rewarding part of a television executive's job.","'Survivor' is one of CBS's signature series and symbol of enduring quality and entertainment on prime time television.","'Zoo' further demonstrates our commitment to high-quality, year-round programming and to high-concept series that play to summer audiences in the U.S. as well as on a global scale.","James Corden is a rare entertainment force who combines irresistible charm, warmth, and originality with a diverse range of creative instincts and performance talent.","We're committed to delivering our viewers and advertisers year-round programming with a wide variety of storytelling.","We continue to see summer as a great place for unique concepts, innovative business models, and passionate television audiences.","I'm part Latin, so everything in the Latin culture is - there's a lot of hyperbole, and there's a lot of melodrama.","As an outsider, you observe what everyone is saying. Insiders are sometimes too insulated, listening to voices in their own little group.","I was drawn to performing and to storytelling.","Failure is a fundamental factor of success.","I'm a voracious reader. What that does is keep your mind fresh and active and hearing different voices and different styles. TV can be derivative, and if you just watch TV, you're not widening the circle.","Audiences like making discoveries.","'Criminal Minds,' our original show, is a phenomenal show, and all elements of that show work so well. I think that 'Suspect Behavior' just didn't click. I don't think it has anything to do with spin-offs. I think a spin-off still has to be successful on its own.","Before I go to bed, sometimes I'll just sit outside and philosophically assess the day.","I feel it's our responsibility to keep our ear tuned to public discourse. There's a lot of noise out there, and our responsibility is to pick up on the themes and issues that work their way through all of society.","You have to present characters an audience can relate to.","I've always seen the world as very gender-neutral.","Producing is a little bit in my blood. Philanthropy also is a very important for me.","My mother was not without her flaws. She did have a lot of flaws, but she revealed her strength and her flaws equally, and I think that's really important. I was very much influenced by that.","I came to understand and observe that we're all going to face obstacles. We're going to have challenges. We're going to fail. We're going to have success. But all of it is going to ultimately be character-building. And it's not going to deter us from wanting to achieve, to strive, and be successful.","In 1963, my parents took over a camp business from my grandparents. They turned it into a liberal, progressive, a co-educational, interracial camp for kids from all over the world, all over the country. And it was a very important cause for both of my parents.","I'm a parent. I'm a mother.","Ever since 'Jericho,' I've loved these big-idea shows.","With all of our big-hit shows - like 'Big Bang Theory,' and even 'How I Met Your Mother' - when they first started, you have multiple characters to service, and you want to make sure that the audience has a chance to get the concept, get the emotional arc, and really engage with the relationships.","Rob Doherty has been a real superstar for us on 'The Mentalist' for years.","Whomever you are and whatever your relationship is to work, I think we all have suffered from being over-hyphenated. You know, 'working-mom,' 'tiger-mom,' 'stay-at-home-mom'... how about 'mom?'","Through eight years, 'How I Met Your Mother' has mastered the art of leading-edge comedy, emotional water-cooler moments, and pop culture catch-phrases.","'The Dovekeepers' is a compelling, beautifully written novel that combines history and fiction into a timeless story of survival and heroism.","I think back to having had the good fortune of being at Warner Bros. when we were doing 'Lois & Clark.' The chemistry between Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher was really wonderful.","Accepting fear head-on is freeing.","Sometimes the career you end up with has no logical connection to where you began.","We don't know where we'll end up, but making moments matter - taking a step back to see something from a different vantage point and investing in your core values - can lead to a world of surprises.","People step on my feet, and I say I'm sorry.","Audiences need to engage with characters.","Television's an intimate medium. It's in our living rooms. It's in our bathrooms. It's in our bedrooms - and we respect that.","I love musicals. I'm a big 'Glee' watcher.","Women drive network television.","18-to-49 can only be part of the story.

But you never advance without losing something en passant, and you lose it because you're paying so much attention to the new thing.","There would never have been a British Ballet without Diaghilev. He had a wonderful influence.","And then you have the classical ballerinas, they're like sopranos. Applied to the dance.","All the children in the school should learn the steps of everything, before they learn the thing, then they know which step they're doing better, because your voice is in certain steps and has to do most of the things that have been composed in those steps.","Nearly everything in life goes in threes and fours.","Hardly any generation wants to take the whole of the last generation, it just wants to take its best bits.","The best way to study is to go to the Cecchetti method for about a year and draw onto all the highest points and then put that into the general method.","Also, if you have an accident, you can't start to dance again at the top, you're too weak; you start with the easy things - the way you did them when you were young, and come up up up, the way you did then.","Exactly the same with dancing, you can't dance until you've learnt steps, the things your feet can do.","There's nothing in the world that isn't good, bad, and indifferent.","God gave us all exactly the same fingers, arms, legs, and feet, but in our different countries we divided them all a little differently as we feel it, do you understand?"],"Nino Schurter":["I worked hard to get stronger and better, and I'm really happy and satisfied.","Every race is like training and preparation.","I worked hard to complete my medal collection.","I'm just really happy.

You come across quite enough ordinary, nondescript people in daily life and I don't see why you should be subjected to them on the stage too.","Old age is a woman's hell.","A man is given the choice between loving women and understanding them.","A sensible woman should be guided by her head when taking a husband, and by her heart when taking a lover.","Words really flattering are not those which we prepare but those which escape us unthinkingly."],"Nir Eyal":["The more professional opportunities came my way, the more time I spent away from my friends - the people I truly cared about. Maintaining friendships with people to talk to, depend on and enjoy takes time.","It is reasonable to think that the more readers put into the Bible app in the form of small investments, the more it becomes a repository of their history of worship. Like a worn dog-eared book, full of scribbled insights and wisdom, the app becomes a treasured asset not easily discarded.","What Facebook wants to create an association with is every time you're bored, every time you have a few minutes. We know that, psychologically speaking, boredom is painful. Whenever you're feeling bored, whenever you have a few extra minutes, this is a salve for that itch.","Don Draper-style advertising is really only available to the biggest brands out there. It's only commodity goods that use those kind of messages because they have to differentiate goods that are really hard to differentiate between - Shell gasoline versus Exxon, Coke versus Pepsi, Sprint versus T-Mobile, it's all the same thing!","I wanted to create a toolkit which I would have wanted as an entrepreneur to use these principles of psychology in product design. Some startups totally forget the trigger. In some, the action is too complicated. Others don't have a variable reward, which maintains mystery.","AdNectar specializes in deploying branded virtual items across top social networking properties and applications. Virtual items are images sent to communicate a message between users of social media.","AdNectar was born out of a class project at the Stanford Graduate School of Business in January of 2008. The founders are all avid social network users and we wanted to see if we could discover the optimal way for advertisers to reach consumers in a way that felt authentic and organic, and yet was scalable to a mass audience.","We originally started AdNectar to serve brand advertisers, but we've now found that our publishers are greatly benefiting from integrating our system. In addition to a new revenue source and the data our API provides, it turns out users actually prefer branded over generic virtual items.","The cold truth is that the best products don't always win. Many times it's - the products that have the ability to keep users coming back and using them without conscious thought and using them out of habit are the ones that keep us coming back.","Google is one of these products that I think is incredibly habit-forming, and it's the kind of product that shows this characteristic of something that we use with little or no conscious thought.","If the food of friendship is time together, how do we make the time to ensure we're all fed? My friends and I have recently come across a way to keep each other close. It fits into our lifestyles despite busy schedules and a surfeit of children. We call it the 'kibbutz.'","Everything I write is meant to share what I'm struggling with. I hope that it helps other people. I benefit from that a great deal because I always hear new ideas from my readers. It's a very symbiotic relationship.","One of the common myths is that when you have kids you can't really have adult relationships, that kids come first. We don't think so. We actually think that we have to take care of ourselves individually. If we can take care of ourselves, then we can become better partners for our spouse.","The market for religious apps is fiercely competitive; searching for 'bible' in the Apple App Store returns 5,185 results. But among all the choices, YouVersion's Bible, funded by LifeChurch.tv of Edmond, Oklahoma, seems to be the chosen one, ranking at the top of the list and boasting more than 641,000 reviews.","The Bible app is designed to make absorbing the Word as frictionless as possible. For example, to make the Bible app habit easier to adopt, a user who prefers to not read at all can simply tap a small icon, which plays a professionally produced audio track, read with all the dramatic bravado of Charlton Heston himself.","The more readers use the Bible app, the more valuable it becomes to them. Switching to a different digital Bible - God forbid - becomes less likely with each new revelation a user types into the app, further securing YouVersion's dominion.","I think my worst habit is struggling with technology, even though I know how this stuff works, I need to bring conscious thought into how I use.","The most habit-forming products are intra-day behaviors. We take out Snapchat or Instagram or Pinterest multiple times a day.","Habits can be good or bad, whereas addictions are always bad."],"Nirmalya Kumar":["Branding is not merely about differentiating products; it is about striking emotional chords with consumers. It is about cultivating identity, attachment, and trust to inspire customer loyalty. Chinese brands score low on attributes such as 'sophisticated,' 'desirable,' 'innovative,' 'friendly,' and 'trustworthy.'","You can't be a professor without having been a student. You can't be a consultant without having been a research associate. So, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs, at some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.","The problem often is that aspiring brands wish to be universally loved. Unfortunately, universal love is neither achievable nor desirable. Instead, great brands are loved by some and hated by others because they actually stand for something.","The problem with the mobile industry is that it deals with an intangible service which is largely similar across major players. Most consumers cannot tell the difference between Vodafone and Orange, or AT&T and Verizon in the U.S., beyond the colors and the logos. I suspect neither can the companies.","Process innovation is different from product innovation. It's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product, but not a new product itself?","What the global delivery model allows is, it allows you to take previously geographically core-located tasks, break them up into parts, send them around the world where the expertise and the cost structure exists, and then specify the means for reintegrating them.","As brands become larger, the need to reach greater numbers of customers makes them less edgy and dilutes their unique positioning as they try to please everyone. It is therefore not surprising to find such brands go into a few years of decline before they are able to reinvent themselves.","Fairly or not, Western consumers associate Chinese products primarily with 'low price.'","Haier, a Chinese brand, exemplifies the trend of emerging market companies building brands that are being accepted, if not recognized, by the Western consumer.","Chinese brands will face many obstacles when marketing to Western consumers. Beyond the associations with poor quality and unsound environmental practices, they generally do not have the marketing capabilities or budgets to build powerful global brands."],"Nita Ambani":["Education is not a tool for development - individual, community and the nation. It is the foundation for our future. It is empowerment to make choices and emboldens the youth to chase their dreams.","Everyday classroom teaching is not what children will remember, but how you made a difference in their lives.","Education is all about igniting young minds and enabling them to attain their fullest potential.","The lotus comes from the murkiest water but grows into the purest thing.","Motherhood is the most challenging as well as the utmost satisfying vocation in this world.","My father-in-law saw me at a dance performance.

It is equally about winning and losing, pooling and galvanising the energy of the youth, upgrading people's physical fitness and mental prowess.","Indian classical dance is sustained by a profound philosophy. Form seeks to merge with the formless, motions seek to become a part of the motionless, and the dancing individual seeks to become one with the eternal dance of the cosmos.","I like to have everything smiley and happy for my husband. Men don't want to see a grumpy face at the end of a hard day.","As Indian women, we are always balancing work, life, home, etc. It's important to know that while juggling rubber balls and glass balls, the former may bounce back when you miss, but the glass balls will crack if you let them fall.

Even if you calculate your every move, it's not like life ever goes according to plan.","I am not very fond of spotlight or even, for that matter, money. I appreciate the small things that give me joy. The most precious forms of happiness often come from things that money cannot buy.","Journalism is not what it used to be. I thought it was an important job, but it is not. I'm idealistic, and it pretty much upsets me that negativity sells and that even if I wanted to tell the truth, I wouldn't be able to if my boss does not okay it.","Nobody goes to college and learns anything.","As an actress, I should be able to do all types of roles.","I am not bothered about if my role in a film is small or big.

What I am doing is not extraordinary.","I don't think I am really awesome. I think I have basic qualification to be an actor.","It doesn't feel great to be compared to Genelia or anyone.

It is a wonderful story with a script that is layered and more complex than the normal ones.","I studied journalism, though I never really became a scribe.","I think acting is my destiny. I did my first film when I was just eight. However, I never took that role seriously.","I wanted to do journalism, as I was an idealist. Then, in my second year of journalism, I realized that in real life, things don't work the way you expect them to. I realized that I could express my ideas better through films.","Initially, I was a bit hesitant to do the role in 'MTP,' as it was a very serious and aching subject.","I must tell you that Telugu film industry is one of the most comfortable places I found a woman can be. They do make a lot of mass films, but from my experience as an actor, I can tell you that people are very nice and welcoming. In fact, it's slightly more difficult in other places.","I'll never forget the dance number that I shot with Anushka. The choreography involved a lot of intricate dance moves. I'm at least 7 inches shorter than Anushka, so I had to wear the highest heels I've ever worn in my life; throughout the song, I even injured my knee a couple of times.","I've never wanted to be an actress. I came into the industry to be a filmmaker, but let us say fate had other plans for me. I don't want to be the next glamour queen.","My cinema is of a different kind: give me a good meaty role instead of two or three songs and running around in foreign locations wearing itsy-bitsy costumes. I'm clear and focussed about my priorities.","For me, a story has to have characters, and my role should be meaningful. At the end of the day, people should say that they like my performance.","I'm not insecure. Give me a good role, and I'll perform even for a multi-starrer with half a dozen other heroines!","Acting was not on my agenda. It just happened by chance. I always wanted to be involved in wildlife protection or maybe surrounded by kids. I love animals and children.","I love being part of this industry, but at the end of the day, it is a job, and I like to have a life beyond films.","I am not sure for how long I'll stick to this industry. Acting is just a part of my nomadic life.","If something has not been part of your dreams or ambitions, then you are not awestruck by it.","If you worry too much, it shows in your acting, and it ceases to be effortless.","Working with a good artiste is always a pleasure. If you get a reaction from your co-star, then you get the space to perform well.","I am not a trained singer, but I love to sing.","I will not accept a role just because a big hero stars in it. I am not here to merely dance, run around trees, and be a glam doll.","After I finished my degree in Mass Communication in Manipal, I enrolled for a cinematography course in Pune Film Institute. That is when Nandini Reddy, the director of 'Ala Modalaindi,' convinced me to act.","I don't enjoy public attention. I don't like being recognised, being clicked, or being written about. But then it is destiny. I am just going with the flow.","We should be actors rather than trying to be a lead; it will create a healthier atmosphere.","I am not intellectually choosy. My choice of films reflect who I am, but it is not done with strategy and planning. I hear something and go by my intuition.","For me, it is not about being a part of a hit or a flop. Films are about friends, learning, and experiences. Certain films give me happiness.","I don't like this concept of second role, small role. It is a story, at the end of the day. If I am suitable for a character, I am glad to reflect that through my choice of films.","Films were always there at the back of my mind. I would try to move away, but films kept coming to me. I would do movies for friends. I guess some things are meant to be!","All these years, I have handpicked my films. It was passion and love for the art that made me do films.","The Malayalam audience knows me as an art film actress, and I am fine with that because I know that such films come from the heart. It's difficult to do them, but the satisfaction you get is immense.","I don't like the idea of being connected to the world all the time. One should have space and time for oneself.","I don't belong to any social network, and I don't even message much. In fact, most of the time, I don't even use my mobile phone.","Being an actress does not mean that each thing that happens in my life has to be news or meant to be shared with others. Acting is a profession, and once I leave the sets, I want to be left alone.","I try to choose characters that are very different; I think I have succeeded in that. A big role or a small one does not bother me at all. What matters is that I should have a rapport with the director.","When I first heard the 'Urumi' script, I was surprised, shocked, and excited. It was a strong script with a reference to the past. It had fact mixed with fiction. To incorporate facts into a film and introduce fictional characters was interesting. I loved the script.","I don't prepare for any role. I go on the sets and do it.","I was honoured to work with Amol Gupte. He is a brilliant person.","I fell in love at 18 when I was in college, and that's probably why I know what it's like to be in love, and I can express it in a better way.","I studied journalism and was idealistic as a student. In course of time, I learnt that there's a lot of politics, and it's not easy to put forth your point of view as an investigative journalist.","I was eight years old when I was offered a film. And before I knew it, I was acting in Kannada, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu movies.","At one point, I wanted to be a wildlife photographer. I also love to travel, so maybe I'd do travel writing.","People in Andhra Pradesh treat me like a girl next door after 'Ala Modalaindi.' I feel at home here.","I don't see gender when I look at the world.","I have met fantastic men in my life and horrible women. I have also met some amazing women and terrible men. I have seen women who are sexists.","Had acting not taken off, I would've been glad to become a teacher.","Even though my family was accepting of an unusual career, cinema, my journey in it has still been a tough one.","The second you become an actress, people take the licence to make many assumptions about you. You're in trouble if you interact with a director/actor. You're in even more trouble if you don't. When I started out, a single YouTube comment would make me sad for days, and I'd wonder how people could say such nasty things about me.","I don't sing professionally; I sing because people who make my films want me to sing. So, as long as they want me to croon in the film, I will sing.","I'm not really interested in doing a Bollywood film.","All of us just go to college and waste our time and to pass our exams. So just learning journalism does not mean I'm good at it or any of the journalists are, either. There is no difference; it's just class, and it's just college.","I'm often asked how I portray the roles I play so convincingly and express so much through my eyes. Quite frankly, I don't know how to explain that. I guess it's about who I'm as a person; I radiate it through my eyes.","I draw inspiration from everything I've seen and been through. My life has been my biggest teacher.","I've been blissfully ignorant about the result of my films and don't get swayed by success or failure.","I'm serious, in general, and I guess I cling onto the little freedom I have offscreen. Having said that, I am funny and, at the same time, detached from a lot of things in life.","My part as an actor ends on the last working day. I think the success or failure only really matters to the producer or whoever it matters to. For me, when I finish the film, I'm done, and if I'm happy, that's that.","I think they call every actress 'bubbly' most of the time!","After I did 'Ala Modalaindi,' I wanted to prove that a girl can also carry a film on her own.","I don't think I need to do a big-ticket film to be considered a big actress.","I felt very comfortable working with Jr. NTR. We immediately broke the ice almost the first day. I always found him very down to earth.","As an actor, it's really exciting and challenging to play a character which is much older than your actual age.","I've always looked forward to do something different in all my films.","I'm really fond of P. C. Sreeram, and we got along quite well on the sets of 'Ishq.'","It's not in every film that you connect to the role.","As long as I know what I'm playing, I shouldn't concern myself with others' footage.","Having a good actor as co-star is always a pleasure, as it gives you space to perform. It's nice to work with nice actors."],"Nivin Pauly":["Every aspect of filmmaking has lured me. Although I'm an actor now, one day, I'd like to direct a film. It's not as though I'm all set to take the plunge; I cherish this dream of calling the shots, but only after I groom myself with the right kind of preparation and the technical know-how.","If a film becomes successful, the actor is blamed for being commercial and not having a true love for movies. When we do serious films, we will be blamed for not planning our career properly. I believe that what one should do is to make good cinema and try to make it successful.","I don't want to adhere to any particular image. I have tried to bring in variety to my characters. But then, only a few actors have managed to earn this tag of a romantic hero. Many have aspired to get such a label. So I am not complaining.","I don't think I have reached that stage where I can evaluate my career. I still have a long way to go. All I wish for now is to make sensible moves and to choose wisely. It doesn't matter if there are gaps between films, as long as the ones I do give me the satisfaction of having done something good.","Honestly, I always wanted to be a star. It's a dream.","Like any other actor, I want to work with good directors, and I always look for good scripts. I've had to say no to some people; I suspect that's the reason I'm called arrogant.","When you are successful, there is this tendency to repeat the elements that we believe have worked in a certain film. Then it becomes formulaic, and there is no getting back.","I don't do many films at the same time, as I don't like to switch between characters. At a given point, I would like to get into the skin of whatever character I am playing.","I have been doing a lot of romantic movies, so such roles don't excite me much now. I would like to play an out-and-out, really cruel villain once. My character in 'Da Thadiya' had such a streak, but I want a full length villainous role. It is a different kind of excitement.","My wife knows that interacting with actresses is all part of the job, but there is a line which I'm not supposed to cross, and as long as I don't cross it, there are no problems. She doesn't bother with whatever I do onscreen. But the line is always there!","I am happy being an actor. Donning the hat of a producer was a tough job and a different experience, as it involved watching the crew's requirements, keeping track of the finances, and also perfecting my role as an actor. But it was a tremendous learning experience.","Some movies are simply magical. You can't really put your finger on any particular reason behind its success.","I never think of myself as a big star. Getting good scripts is all I think about. I don't have a godfather or anyone to take care of me. To move forward, I have to be very careful in choosing the right scripts, the right director, and the right technicians.","I don't plan or schedule my career thinking first I will play a common man, then a police officer, then a superhero. I love good scripts, and I don't care if I play the main part in it or not. I want to be a part of good films. That's my dream... 'Jacobinte Swargarajyam' was that film for me.","I always start my New Year at church with my family. I see it as a fresh beginning - like a new chance we get to renew our lives, perhaps? Starting it by praying gives me a lot of hope for the future.","I have a bad history with resolutions! I don't think I have kept up even one of them so far. Once, I promised to myself that I would wake up at 6 A.M. every day - it didn't even last for a week.","Four of my films have been remade in Tamil and Telugu. Although I haven't seen any of these remakes, I do feel happy that I've been a part of good films. It's nice to know that some scripts still leave behind a mark after their theatrical run this way, so I have to admit, it is quite flattering.","I simply love coming to Chennai. My wife always complains, saying, 'You literally run at the mention of Chennai - I wonder what it is about that place!' I love how everyone is active here 24/7. Even at 5 A.M., there are people going about their day. Also, I love how respectful and polite Chennaiites are.","I was working as a software engineer in Infosys. I quit because I lost interest in it. I had a group of friends who wanted to make it big in films, and that's when the audition for 'Malarvady Arts Club' happened. I got selected, and it opened the doors to my dream world.","I am, by nature, pretty reserved. It was after I became an actor that I started interacting more with people from different walks of life!","The poor show of a film can be crucial in an actor's career. Maybe that is why some actors choose to act in a lot of films, so as not to be affected by a single hit or a flop.","Acting is strenuous, both physically and mentally. But if you are passionate about it, nothing can be more exciting than acting.","My aim is that each of my films should be on the top five or, at least, the top 10 lists of the year.","When I choose a role, I look for that spark that tells me it's going to work. Is the role fresh? What does it have for the actor in me? Those are the only things any actor should be concerned about, really.","As a youngster, when I was active in church, I had a lot of fun choosing and hanging massive stars and making the cribs. I was also very involved in the Christmas plays, though not as an actor, but I took joy in setting up the props.","You can obviously roam in public, but you can't do that with complete abandon. At the back of your mind, you are always worried if someone's watching you. But then, it's something that comes with the job profile. People approach you because they like you, and I don't see it as a hassle. It's a blessing."],"Nnamdi Azikiwe":["Originality is the essence of true scholarship. Creativity is the soul of the true scholar.","It is better we disintegrate in peace and not in pieces.","Israel has created a new image of the Jew in the world - the image of a working and an intellectual people, of a people that can fight with heroism."],"Nnedi Okorafor":["I go to the ocean to calm down, to reconnect with the creator, to just be happy.","I love ocean life. I'm fascinated that so much of it remains unexplored by human beings. Diluted seawater consisted of nearly the same concentration of elements and minerals as blood plasma. They've got the same amount of sodium, too.","I see the world as a magical place. Therefore, it was only natural that magic wafted from my fiction like smoke.","I grew up reading Stephen King, Peter Straub, Clive Barker, Robert McCammon, Isaac Asimov's nonfiction books, and Roald Dahl.","I would try to write 'realistic' fiction, and someone would fly, or there would be a black hole full of demons or a girl who attracted frogs.","I think speculative fiction has fewer unspoken prerequisites than literary fiction for writers of color.","One of my feet is a whole size longer than the other. One is size ten, the other is size eleven.","It's more fun to write villains. They are more of a challenge, and I get a sick kind of pleasure out of delving into their minds. There's rarely emptiness, and there is almost always deep intelligence.","I love writing about monsters and food.","There's a story in 'Kabu Kabu' called 'Bakasi Man' where I got to explore the mind of a 'bad man.' It was fun.","'Lagoon' is an ambitious novel.","I love and am terrified of the water, particularly the ocean.","'Who Fears Death' addresses the push and pull in African culture that powerful women face when their culture has certain duties and beliefs that can stifle them."],"Nneka":["I hope that what I am today is of positive benefit to other people.","Living in Germany Africanised me.","Listening to the type of music I grew up with, like King Sunny Ade, Fela Kuti and experiencing different things and conditions and hardship, as well as the good times in Nigeria, has definitely carved me into who I am.","If you're able to grow up in Nigeria and go through certain things, you're able to tackle anything around the world because you're able to live wherever, if you can survive in a city like Lagos or Warri or Niger Delta, as far as I'm concerned.","I must be true to myself within my music or I would be a liar.","At times I have a beat first and then I write. Sometimes I have a melody in my head and I pick up the guitar to develop the song. Other times I just write without any melodies, and I end up using those lyrics when I think I have the appropriate instrumental that would bring out and depict the emotions of what I have written.","I think it's important to learn instruments, whenever one has a little space. Be eager to learn and love your instrument.","Take advantage of educating yourself.","My music is very versatile, very mixed.","In Nigeria, if you say you're a singer, people say, 'So what? Everyone sings.' In Germany, my voice stood out more.","My father is a very strict man.","I was a very conscientious student.","My heart's desire is to be recognised in Nigeria.","I don't want to be a big star. I just want to get my message across.","The way people see Africa is mostly dark.","Everything that the West is today is predominantly because of Africa.","I always like earthy, authentic sounds.","I tend to explain my songs."],"Noah Baumbach":["When you're around your family, and you have that history and that shared language, you say things you'd be embarrassed to hear quoted back to you later.","Many of the crew members I work with and continue to work with were friends or have become close friends, and so we keep working together. And I like casting friends of mine or people I know in parts I know would be perfect for them. I like to bring things and people that mean something to me in to my work.","It's nice being friends over a period of time with people whose music you like so much, or other filmmakers, seeing people change, go through trials.","A lot of black-and-white films generally have a color version that will be used for TV.","Adaptations are fun for me because they connect to the idea of filmmaking I had when I was a kid. I would see a movie and think: 'I'm gonna make that movie.'","When you find yourself on the Internet when you're supposed to be writing, you've already lost. It's even beyond procrastination when you end up on the Internet.","As a kid, I thought of myself as a funny person who secretly wanted to be serious, but now I think maybe I'm a serious person who secretly wants to be funny.","Being funny, in some ways, is about being connected to psychology.","I try to procrastinate, if I can, productively, like I'll work on something else as procrastination. Or I take a walk. Because often I find, if you get out, more things come to you.","I'm interested in music as an extension of character.","I think anxiety is dangerous, but it makes you think it's your friend.","I've always liked working with friends or, you know, people I have outside relationships with.","I've had times in my life when I really haven't been able to figure myself out.","I graduated in '91, so the '90s for me were very much the first years out of school, so I can't really look at that decade as independent of my own experience of my 20s, really.","There's always some generational-guys-hanging-out movie that is made every few years, I think, and some of them are great.","I've always felt some kind of connection to people who are kind of over-smart. People who over-think things to the point of some sort of paralysis, and I think that certainly can be me on any given day.","Will Ferrell's made a lot of brilliant movies.","Friends of friends had bands in college or in their early 20s and had a moment where they had some kind of interest from a record label or manager. It's always interesting how people handle those decisions and those moments.","There's something really vulnerable about playing something that you like for someone. You don't know what their reaction will be.","There are the people who overthink making mix CDs and playlists, and how that works generationally is all really interesting to me.","With 'Greenberg,' I wanted to make a movie about Los Angeles... my great love for it and also the way that I felt not at home and alienated there.","Manhattan is so tailored. It's driven by appealing to the very wealthy and tourists.","Truffaut loved Hitchcock.","There was a telemarketing job one summer in high school that I was rejected for. I still walk by the building that I actually had the interview in. It's still in New York, and I always think about that job and why I didn't get it.","When I was a kid, I would fantasize about my own funeral.","My dad was a great movie companion. He wouldn't diminish 'The Jerk.' If I liked it, he liked it. He could see it through my eyes.","You can be aware that something is idiosyncratic, and give it to a character, but keep doing it.","It's always really special to be at the New York Film Festival, and always a real privilege.","That's the nice thing about collaborating with someone: Your work becomes a conversation.","I used to get up and write every day, even if I wasn't working on a specific thing. Now, when I have a thing I'm in the middle of, I do that, but when I'm not, time can go by when I'm not writing at all.","I find a lot of writing happens when you're not actually at the computer. So I carry a notebook.","'The Squid and the Whale' I shot in 23 days. I would have loved more time for it at the time, but in some ways that kind of kamikaze way of shooting was right for that movie.","It's near impossible to make a movie in black and white in the system.","How you start the movie is critical. And how often you feel that there's no reason for how it's starting.","There is an isolated experience to being a director. It's very communal because there's a crew, but it's only you. You're the one on the hook.","I think sometimes bad behaviour can be liberating for certain people. They need to behave badly to find themselves - to go off path to find their path. You see it with kids all the time: They're testing boundaries, and I think that's healthy.","I wouldn't say 'Frances Ha' is autobiographical, but it's definitely very personal.","I think I was going through a lot of change at 27, but I didn't know it was happening until it was over.","I don't agree with the idea that my characters are unlikeable.","Woody Allen's movies are so much a part of me. I grew up watching them over and over and would read all his comic pieces for the New Yorker. In some ways, his influence is so much there that I can't even locate it any more.","To this day, I have people I might meet who will make assumptions about my life based on fictional elements of 'The Squid And The Whale.' But I think that's par for the course if you make something that feels kind of real.","Even fairly serious moviegoers can't shake this shadow of the corporate world.","It's kind of major, learning to drive. I feel like it kicked up other stuff in my life.","Anyone who's putting money into your movie would always rather you cast well-known people.","I get a lot of responses to my movies. Some people say, 'Oh, I thought it was really funny - I hope that's okay!' And my answer always is 'Yes. It's totally okay.'","I suppose some studio executive would say it's death for a comedy if people aren't all laughing in the same places, but I find with my movies that people laugh in very different places. I can't control it.","I'm always interested in how people, myself included, have ideas of themselves, of how they thought they would be, or of how they want to be seen. And the older you get, the world keeps telling you different things about yourself. And how people either adjust to those things and let go of adolescent notions. Or they dig in deeper.","When I start a movie, there will be certain films that I watch again just because the vibe seems right.","I thought at the time of my parents' divorce that I was upset by deeper, more profound things and I was just taking it out on the joint custody agreement. But that disruption was bad enough. That was a huge deal for a teenager.","Other people have worked with big studios and maintained control over their movies. I see no reason why it wouldn't work for me.","I'm curious how people build up the codes that they live their life by, and how they come to think that that's the best way for them to function.","I think if we taped a lot of families that claim to be relatively normal, you'd be surprised when you hear some of the things said.","I made two movies very young, and then I had trouble getting a movie made, and so - which was both, I think, a plus and a minus. It was a minus because it made me unhappy.","I really like my first movie a lot, 'Kicking and Screaming.' I think it's a - I'm very pleased and proud of that movie, but it wasn't the - it wasn't 'Citizen Kane' right out of the box, you know? It wasn't 'Sex, Lies and Videotape.'","I've run into more people walking in L.A. than if I drove. Because you stand out so much if you walk. People from my past have stopped their cars and said, 'Hey!' But if I was in a car, they never would've seen me.","We expect forty-year-olds to have grown up at some point, and to be engaged and adult and take responsibility, and doing nothing would seem to go against that.","Defining yourself by your taste is easier than defining yourself by any genuine stance on something.","I think it's always interesting how music means different things to different people, and people who overthink it are looking to in some ways show off with music, versus people who just respond to a song and decide to sing it.","I guess I'm interested in people who are very sophisticated in intellectual ways, while being completely off the mark in emotional ones, with these huge blind spots in terms of their own behavior.","I think all my movies are about transitions to some degree.","I don't like when you necessarily know that this is the end of the movie. I like when a movie ends abruptly. You go through this, and some of the scenes are uncomfortable, and some are funny - and then suddenly it's over.","I do like having books on my shelves. I do value that life.","I still carry the residue of the pressure I felt as a child to read and appreciate the right books. Growing up, I never allowed myself to read beach reading. I was always plowing through Ford Madox Ford's 'Good Solider' or something I wasn't equipped to understand.","I grew up in the heat of '70s postmodern fiction and post-Godard films, and there was this idea that what mattered was the theory or meta in art.","I always viewed life as material for a movie.","I know people who are incredibly successful who still dress the way they did when they were 18, just because they still think that's how they look good.","We all have these notions of cool that come about at different points in our lives, and it's interesting in how it evolves or doesn't evolve in different people.","I read all the time. Sometimes I get asked if I've thought about writing a novel.","Being articulate, my parents could make anything sound reasonable.","The real achievement of Woody Allen was that he was making movies that felt very personal, and for a whole group of people, it spoke to them. Then he became an archetype, like Groucho Marx or Chaplin.","I like the way corduroys feel. I like the sort of jean aspect of corduroys, but also the texture of them. They probably remind me of my childhood, too, I think. I wore cords, and my dad had a corduroy jacket.","I think I've always been drawn to the notion of talk as cinematic.","I like shooting in New York because I have such a connection to the city. I have so many memories there.","I kind of live like a writer. I get up and I write. I've done that my whole life.","Wes Anderson grew up in Houston, and he and I talk about Manhattan in similar ways, as a kind of fantasy world.","Peter Bogdanovich is a good friend.","I watch movies all the time, so it's hard to pick certain specific directors that have inspired me in the aggregate.","I didn't train in directing; I talk to actors the way I talk to anybody."],"Noah Emmerich":["In the modern world there's no such thing as formality. A dinner jacket used to mean a tuxedo, you know?","It seems like the more I live, the more I realize that saying 'yes' is almost never a mistake. If you say no, it might feel safe, but then you end up going nowhere.","That's the weirdest thing about television for me is that you're getting feedback in the middle of the work.","A movie set or any set is a completely private place and it feels very insulated.","I did do a war movie, 'Windtalkers.' That was a lot of action. But once you've done one big action/war movie, you don't need to do another one.","My brother started in the music business, and I was an actor - we were both in the entertainment industry, but doing separate things. Then he went over to New Line and started their soundtrack department, that's how he got his foot in the door.","After every movie, you get offered the role that you just did in the last movie.","Some of the things I've been in are comedic, but I don't get considered for true comedies because I'm a 'dramatic' actor.","I'm actually pretty scientifically interested. I have a lot of friends who are doctors, so the idea of the virus and the synapses in the brain and how the nervous system works was actually all pretty familiar to me.","I'm not really a zombie genre guy; I'm not particularly versed in it. Doing 'The Walking Dead' sort of turned me on to the whole thing."],"Noah Feldman":["During the boom years of the 1990s, globalization emerged as the most significant development in our national life. With NAFTA and the Internet and big-box stores selling cheap goods from China, the line between national and international began to blur.","Cyber attacks are not what makes the cool war 'cool.' As a strategic matter, they do not differ fundamentally from older tools of espionage and sabotage.","Empires inevitably fall, and when they do, history judges them for the legacies they leave behind.","In 1953, after the armistice ending the Korean War, South Korea lay in ruins. President Eisenhower was eager to put an end to hostilities that had left his predecessor deeply unpopular, and the war ended in an uneasy stalemate.","Cyber war takes place largely in secret, unknown to the general public on both sides.","The rise of the presidency began with the Louisiana Purchase, which in 1803 doubled the land mass of the United States. History taught the framers that, just as Rome changed from republic to empire with conquest of new lands, territorial acquisition would lead to the centralization of political power.","When we put our trust in diplomacy, it is not because it is an inspiring or uplifting discourse or because it helps us see the common humanity in others. The stylized circumlocutions of diplomats can make them seem ridiculous or irrelevant: they never seem to be talking about what is really going on.","During the New Deal, people thought to be liberal was to reject socialism on one extreme and fascism on the other, and to preserve capitalism through regulation and a social safety net.","Every generation gets the Constitution that it deserves. As the central preoccupations of an era make their way into the legal system, the Supreme Court eventually weighs in, and nine lawyers in robes become oracles of our national identity.","From a constitutional standpoint, the religion of a candidate is supposed to make no difference. Even before the founding fathers dreamed up the First Amendment, they inserted a provision in the Constitution expressly prohibiting any religious test for office.","What is driving the tendency to discount Joseph Smith's revelations is not that they seem less reasonable than those of Moses; it is that the book containing them is so new. When it comes to prophecy, antiquity breeds authenticity. Events in the distant past, we tend to think, occurred in sacred, mythic time.","Marriage is the most obvious public practice about which information is readily available. When combined with the traditional Jewish concern for continuity and self-preservation - itself only intensified by the memory of the Holocaust - marriage becomes the sine qua non of social membership in the modern Orthodox community.","The modern presidency, as expressed in the policies of the administration of George W. Bush, provides the strongest piece of evidence that we are governed by a fundamentally different Constitution from that of the framers.","The world is littered with constitutions that have written guarantees of rights but that don't actually deliver rights. What differentiates the ones where rights are real from where rights are fake is that it's in the initial interests of the majority to actually deliver these rights.","The world is full of nations that are part of the community of nations that don't respect rights.","Iraqi national identity under Saddam Hussein never truly incorporated Shiites or Kurds. Sunnis, who identified most closely with the Iraqi nation, remain in some ways disenfranchised relative to the other groups, or at least they perceive themselves that way.","Faced with the collapse of Iraq into something like Lebanon - or worse, Somalia - the Bush administration opted for a new counterinsurgency strategy. Violence was reduced because, for the first time since the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, Iraqis felt that there was a force capable of dominating the situation and ensuring basic order.","The practical core of democracy, defined functionally, is the peaceful exchange of power between different groups of powerful political players arranged in parties.","To hear both critics and defenders talk about the fitness of Judge Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court, you'd think the most successful Supreme Court justices had been warm, collegial consensus-builders. But history tells a different story.","The true test of whether Mr. Obama has improved on the Bush era lies in how his administration justifies its decisions on the 241 remaining Guantanamo detainees, whose cases will now be evaluated internally and reviewed by the courts.","Given the pervasive secrecy of the Bush-Cheney administration, and the sorry consequences of that disposition, President Barack Obama's early emphasis on openness in government seems almost inevitable.","The great difficulty with Guantanamo is it was perceived correctly as being a place where people were not being detained subject to rules. I don't think the world thinks that you can't detain suspected terrorists - the world thinks you can do that, but you have to do it pursuant to rules and to clear charges.","Well-meaning Europeans sometimes argue that unlike the U.S., their countries are traditionally 'homogeneous' and have little experience with immigration.","The core idea that underlies all of our democratic states, the core political idea, is this idea that it's not that one person is the sovereign; it's that all of the people are sovereign.","How can you have the religion of the sovereign be the religion of the state if the sovereign belongs to many religions? And it's at that point, I think, historically, that you start to see people saying maybe the state should not associate itself with any religion. Maybe there shouldn't be any official religion.","I have a 2-year-old son, and I know I'm dealing with a big, grand word when I can't point to the thing when I define it. Right? If he wants to know what a chair is, I can point to the chair. If he wants to know what religion is, I can't point to anything in particular. The same is true of the state.","A constitutional tradition that works is one that is in a constant state of dynamic evolution. You have a written constitution that says 'x,' but no constitutional system works if it just follows what's in that written constitution and never changes. Interpretation gives it the freedom to change.","It is often noted that it can be hard for democracies to fight wars because of changing public opinion.","For Mitt Romney, the complex question of anti-Mormon bias boils down to the practical matter of how he can make it go away. Facing a traditional American anti-Catholicism, John F. Kennedy gave a speech during the 1960 presidential campaign declaring his private religion irrelevant to his qualifications for public office.","Mormonism was born amid secrecy, and throughout its existence as a religion it has sustained a close yet complex relationship to the arts of silence.","In politics, Joseph Smith was something of a radical. He preached, instead of democracy, a version of theocratic rule within a framework given by his own prophetic leadership. At Nauvoo, Smith affected a Napoleonic uniform and made himself into a general and quasi king of the polity he had constituted.","The Mormons' passage from bugbears of the Republican Party to its stalwarts may be analogized to a similar move among middle-class white Southerners, to whom the Republican Party was anathema until the 1970s and '80s, after which it became almost the sole representative.","Our post-denominational age should be the perfect time for a Mormon to become president, or at least the Republican nominee. Mormons share nearly all the conservative commitments so beloved of the evangelicals who wield disproportionate influence in primary elections.","Like many great world faiths, Mormonism has an important strand of sacred mystery. Mormon temples have traditionally been closed to outsiders and designed with opaque windows.","It seems strange to the rest of the world, but we Americans can't seem to stop talking about how other countries should be democratic like we are.","An empire that extends itself selectively is just being prudent about its own limitations. A republic that supports democratization selectively is another matter.","The yeshiva where I studied considers itself modern Orthodox, not ultra-Orthodox. We followed a rigorous secular curriculum alongside traditional Talmud and Bible study.","To try to be at once a Lithuanian yeshiva and a New England prep school: that was the unspoken motto of the Maimonides School of Brookline, Mass., where I studied for 12 years.","Since the birth of modern Orthodox Judaism in 19th-century Germany, a central goal of the movement has been to normalize the observance of traditional Jewish law - to make it possible to follow all 613 biblical commandments assiduously while still participating in the reality of the modern world.","The 1994 elections that brought Newt Gingrich to power in the House decisively shaped the remaining years of Bill Clinton's presidency, pushing him further to the right and bringing out his latent tendency to govern every day as if an election were being held the next.","Even a lame-duck president can be affected by a clear midterm message if he wants to see his vice president elected and preserve his historical legacy.","Prisoners, according to the law, who are non-U.S. citizens and are detained outside the U.S. - including in Guantanamo Bay - are denied 'habeas corpus.' They are also denied the right to claim the Geneva Conventions confer certain rights on them.","After 9/11, most Americans were in no mood to talk with our enemies in the Middle East, whatever those enemies' ideology, and the Bush administration's policies of invasion and pre-emption reflected that sentiment.","In an ideological age, diplomacy may seem weak and prosaic. But sometimes it is all we have.","The transformation of the United States from a traditional republic to a democratic nation run in large measure by a single executive took a couple of hundred years.","The administration of George W. Bush, emboldened by the Sept. 11 attacks and the backing of a Republican Congress, has sought to further extend presidential power over national security. Most of the expansion has taken place in secret, making Congressional or judicial supervision particularly difficult.","We often imagine that the court serves as a sort of neutral umpire controlling the warring political branches. But this is mostly myth. The justices of the Supreme Court are themselves actors in the struggle for power, and when they intervene, they think carefully about how their decisions will affect the court's own legitimacy and authority.","William O. Douglas married not one, not two, not three, but four hot blondes. He was not faithful to any of them, not even the last, and each was younger than the previous woman... But after his personal life began to actually fall apart, he developed a set of values about the Constitution that turned out to maximize our autonomy and freedom.","Roosevelt got a chance to name an amazing nine justices of the Supreme Court. He was not namby-pamby on this question. He wanted people who shared his views, he wanted liberals, and he wanted lots of them.","FDR's justices were allies while he was alive, but after he died, they developed four totally different theories of what the Constitution is, two of which are considered conservative and two of which are considered liberal.","In the first decade of the twenty-first century, the major international question was the relation between Islam and democracy.","The Chinese public is deeply nationalist, which matters to China's unelected political leadership as much as U.S. nationalism does to American politicians. As China becomes the world's largest economy, there is meaningful public pressure for its power status to advance in parallel. Any alternative would be humiliating."],"Noah Gray-Cabey":["My friends love to tease me about the fact that I won't be able to drive until I'm a sophomore in college.","My dad actually taught me how to play piano. I was classically trained, but I've started to branch off a little bit into blues and jazz. That's my new thing.","I am a big lover of the environment. I actually come from Maine, which is pretty much all environment.","I went through a period of time when math was my favorite subject. Then math wasn't as fun so much.","I actually don't want to be an actor for the rest of my life. I'd like to go on to be a lawyer or a doctor, and I definitely would like to get into politics."],"Noah Hathaway":["Harley's been influential, but I'm not a big Harley fan.","With Harley, you build it, then you've got to take it apart.","I mean, there are things in the book you could never do in a movie.","In L.A., everybody ain't so nice.","This is really showing me what certain movies mean to people.","I'm trying to open a Chopper shop this year.","So we're going to do a Battlestar Galactica themed bike and bring another one of the bikes.","It's a little weird exchanging pictures for money. You know what I mean. It makes me a little uncomfortable.","We had a showing of Battlestar in LA last week. I walked out the door and there were 50 people. I signed a ton of autographs. Other actors walked away without signing. These are the fans. I guess it depends. on who you are.","I'm a martial arts buff, so anything martial arts.","I speak French fluently, so that really helped.","I'm an action fanatic.","I'm not a huge drama person. I think I liked them more when I was younger.","Now, I'm getting a little older, got more responsibility, I don't need to be depressed.","I don't want to sit and cry for an hour in a movie. I'd rather have an action or a comedy.","My father was a writer and an acting teacher.","I'd have to say the whole experience in making The Neverending Story. I had an incredible time.","I would like any type of character that I could be creative with and totally delve into.","Atreyu comes from a land called Fantasia. It's an imaginary land.","Well, TV series tie you up. You can't do films while you're doing a TV series.","I'd rather do a lot of movies than a TV series and do a lot of different roles than be stuck in one TV thing."],"Noah Hawley":["The most dangerous thing, when you have a serious mental illness, is convincing yourself that you don't have it. And you see it all the time. People get on medication, and they feel better, and they stop taking it. And some flirt with unreality on some levels. But it feels so convincing to them that it feels real.","The anthology format is completely normal to me. That's just how TV works in my experience.","Having written for film and television, I had little interest in turning 'The Good Father' into a Hollywood thriller. I was writing a novel, and novels demand that the writer goes deeper, both emotionally and thematically.","The great thing about making an ensemble show is it becomes modular. It might work on the page to cut from one scene to another, but on the screen, it's more powerful to take that second scene and move it first or move it later.","Greatness and fiasco is the same. You're reaching for something just out of your grasp, and if you get it, it's great, and if you don't, it's a disaster.","There are things we can control and the things we can't control. I can't control how people react to the work I do.","Let me be clear. 'The Good Father' isn't a handbook on how to assassinate the president.","I don't write these stories for the rewards that come back to me. I write them because I have to write them. It's a sickness on some level. It's a compulsion.","As a storyteller, you have the story that you tell, and you have the way you can tell it, and both are equally important.","I'm on a lot of airplanes. There are definitely times when I just vapor-lock. I'm on the plane, and I have so much to do, I just don't know what to do. It never lasts for very long. It might last for the flight.","People, they don't know how to bend; they just break.","My feeling is there's a lot of straight drama on television. My goal in life is to try to create something unexpected, and genre is the tool in doing that.","Making a new season for 'Legion' is not something you just switch into. It's not something you do between dropping the kids off in the morning and having dinner at night. That's a retreat into the woods for six weeks with some mushrooms, and trying to come back with the answers.","One of the things that I've always appreciated about the 'X-Men' style of storytelling versus other Marvel stories is how fluid the line between good and bad and right and wrong is.","What's great is that each medium has a unique set of things that it does and does well. Film is a visual medium, and obviously, you can't fit a whole book into two hours unless you're really economical about it. Obviously, they say a picture is worth a thousand words, and on some level, it's sort of true.","I think this idea of fighting the enemy within is sort of more interesting than fighting an external enemy.","I think people used to read 'War and Peace,' and now they don't; now they sit around with their tablets and watch 'Downton Abbey' and 'Breaking Bad' or whatever, and they want the things that they watch to be better so that they can feel better about themselves for watching it.","One of the things I've always loved about genre, comic books, science fiction and fantasy is that there's a certain level of playfulness to them, and pure imagination and creativity.","What makes something tragic is that it could've been averted at multiple points.","I come from a family of writers. My mom had been a writer, nonfiction books, and her mother was a playwright in the 1930s and '40s. And my twin brother, Alexi, is a writer on 'The Following.'","When I sold my first book, 'A Conspiracy of Tall Men,' it was part of a two-book deal. It wasn't hugely lucrative, but it was enough money for me to quit the paralegal job I had in San Francisco.","I was part of a writers' collective with 21 writers and filmmakers called the San Francisco Writers' Grotto. We had our own office space in this old converted dog and cat hospital, and we had a basketball hoop outside. I'd bring my dog to work every day and write.","I sat down to take a break from writing a book and wrote a spec feature that would end up being the movie 'Lies & Alibis' with Steve Coogan.","In a traditional TV show or movie, your hero is always where the action is. But in real life, at the end of the movie 'Fargo,' when Bill Macy is arrested, Marge is nowhere to be found because it's a different jurisdiction, and she wouldn't be there. I took that to heart.","I think for really good-hearted people, that idea of putting yourself in the shoes of a monster to figure out why they acted that way, that's a really frightening idea.","The first dumb idea was to do it at all - to take 'Fargo,' this beloved classic, and turn it into a television show. The second dumb idea, when you do it and it works, was to throw everything out and start again.","I'm not that guy who thinks I have all the answers. Writing is a means of communicating, and if enough people say, 'I don't get it,' it's worth looking at.","The '50s and the '70s are sort of similar in that they're both times of major paranoia in America.","Experimental film by the '70s had become much more mainstream after 'Bonnie and Clyde' and stuff in the late '60s, when you were seeing bigger movies where people were exploring the medium a lot more.","I love the idea that the editing room is the final time you write. You should still be creatively solving problems even at that point. It's not really until you're locked that you can call it quits.","You need a good James Clavell novel, I think, to make a good miniseries.","I pitched the idea to FX that there's this larger 'Fargo' universe where there's true crime in the upper Midwest, and I can tell stories from any era of that. Maybe they connect to the first season or the movie, or maybe they don't. It's just a style of storytelling. We're under the auspices of being a true story that isn't true.","I drove around New York when we did the upfronts and when we premiered 'Fargo,' and they crocheted a sweater for a double-decker bus and drove it around.","There is a difference between movie actors and TV acting, especially with movie stars, which is they know their face is 20 feet high on the screen. They know they don't have to do much.","It used to be for writers that that six seasons and a movie thing, that's the holy grail as writers - your series goes eight, 10 seasons, you're set for life.","'Downton Abbey' didn't have the impact it had just because it was a good story about people. It was something about that period and that world that was fascinating to people on a level that wasn't just as an entertainment.","Making 'Fargo' for FX has been the highlight of my career. A writer can search his or her whole career for a network partner who truly understands and encourages their vision. For me, the search is over.","There is the moral spectrum in 'Fargo,' and you see it in other Coen brothers movies, where you have a very good character on one end and a very bad character on the other.","'Fargo' is a tragedy with a happy ending. So you need to have that tragic underpinning, that all of this could be avoidable, and that's what makes it tragic. It's about the use of violence, and the fact that the tension in anticipation of violence and the tension in anticipation of a laugh are sort of the same.","I remain a huge 'Game of Thrones' fan.","There's a sense you get from the Coens' work, like 'No Country for Old Men,' where you put these characters in situations, and you just let this painful amount of time take place. Part of the tension is just how long it takes to get out of that scene.","When you're a writer on a show, your job is to write in the show runner's voice, really.","I did some feature work, then tried TV. I was always very aware that the only power that you have is the power of options. If the film industry dries up, then you focus on the TV or the books. For me, it was always about what story do I want to tell next?","I've always been really attracted to playing with structure. To take the story of 'Fargo' and break it up in such a way that's it's not linear, per se.","The thing with making your art your business is: It's a business. You can't sit around waiting for the muse, especially when you run a show, and you're in production, and an outline is due, a script is due, and a reshoot is due. No. You look at the calendar, and you go, 'OK. I can write from 4 to 6.' So you write.","The prospect of being a father made me ask myself a question. How do you know what kind of adult your child will turn out to be? And how much can you control that?","The idea was always going to be that each year is a stand-alone story, which did make it easier on some level. It also requires the network to have the creative imagination to say, 'This is also 'Fargo,' you know what I mean?","There's the craft of acting, and then there's a quality. There's a quality that someone has.","The great amount of fun that I have is I can cast dramatic actors to play comedic roles, and I can cast comedic actors to play dramatic roles because, really, there's no such thing. There's just actors.","I'm attracted to ensembles: you get a lot of really good moving pieces. It's sort of like a horse race in a way, especially when you know that everyone is on this collision course. It's like, 'Who's going to make it?' And you can put people together in unexpected pairings.","Tension is all about, 'Why is this taking so long?' The interesting thing about that is that it's also the tension of comedy. The tension of drama and comedy is similar, and that's why usually you can get a big laugh in a really tense moment because people need that release.","'Fargo' becomes a metaphor for a type of true crime case where truth is stranger than fiction. So, there's no reason that there isn't another 10-hour true crime story that could be told in this region.","Obviously, when you do something with drama and comedy in it - and by that, I mean a scene that has drama and comedy in it - you know the minute you introduce music, you're either scoring the drama or you're scoring the comedy, and therefore the scene becomes either dramatic or comedic.","America is a huge country, filled with great tracts of open land. If you're not careful, you can get lost in it - lost emotionally, mentally, spiritually.","I think a writer's first job is to entertain, even in novels: to tell a compelling story that pulls the reader along toward an end. At the same time, the best stories are character-driven.","I think the age of the modern media campaign has created a new icon, the celebrity-in-chief. Political elections have become wars fought by candidates with opposing values.","What success has done is present me with a lot of opportunities, and I haven't necessarily learned to say 'no' as well as I should have.","If there's one thing that television doesn't really do, and has never really done, is to tell a surreal story.","I would have loved to have been in the room with the ABC executives when they watched David Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' TV pilot. You know that had to be a long silence after that thing stopped.","Anytime you want to create something different, you have to convince people that it's O.K. 'We'll be O.K. It's going to work out. It's going to be great.'","I don't think we have to suffer personally to make great art. If you're prepared and organized, and you know what you're looking for, you can make great art and then go home.","I try to approach the film medium as a novelist and the novel medium as a filmmaker on some level. It's that question: Do we think in pictures, or do we think in language? And the novelist believes one thing, and the filmmaker believes another thing - and I'm fascinated by that balance.","I guess I still have this motto: 'What else can I get away with?' And unpredictability in film - that's the hardest thing there is.","Bringing back stamp collecting and bringing back bridge seems like a pretty good way to fight the modern world.","The great thing about 'Fargo' is that it's a more objective style of filmmaking: the camera moves in very classical ways, and the most interesting things normally are the characters.","I'm a big believer that the structure of stories should reflect the content of the story.","In 'The X-Men' world, one can be a hero one day and a villain the next, which means there's a constant battle for a character's soul that's dynamic. I find that really fascinating.","As for my schedule, I tend to go to bed at the same time every night and get up at the same time every morning, and I try to be as productive as possible. Some days, I can devote to one specific thing. Other days, it's a catch-all day.","It's a human desire to be scared. On some level, that's how we survived - that sense of fear and danger. Our lives are much safer, so we gravitate to those stories that makes us feel those things and learn lessons, even if it's just, 'What are you doing? Don't go in the basement!'","One of the things I love about Joel and Ethan Coen's movies is that there is this element of the ethereal and the mythic that they play with.","The great thing about an anthology is that each year is its own 10-hour movie, and the only requirement is that it's the best 10-hour movie that I can make out of the story.","The danger of writing a so-called thriller is that in your last 100 pages, all of these really interesting characters you've created are just running away from something or toward something, but they're no longer capable of innovation or discovery.","I think that we're pattern-seeking animals, and what we like best is a story where everything fits together, where there's no puzzle pieces left over.","When I took on 'Fargo,' I thought, 'Well, this is just a terrible idea. Four people will watch it, and they'll hate-watch.' But that allowed me to just go for it and take the risks.","We're used to a story in modern terms as an information delivery device. Certainly on television and even with the studio films, there's really only one note that you get, and that's clarity. And people will sacrifice everything for clarity. They'll sacrifice the joke. They'll sacrifice the moment, or the romance.","The last thing you want is to be desperate in Hollywood.","TV is all about learning to write in someone else's voice, so if you do it long enough without selling your own project, they assume you don't have your own voice; you're just a good mimic.","'Legion' is meant to be a show that is a state of mind. But the problem with TV is that there are commercials. There's a hypnotic quality to the way we put it together. I need to get you out of your life in the first seven minutes of that show.","The job at broadcast is to figure out what the dumbest person in the room is going to think. That's not the case at FX.","I am a salesman, I am an executive, I look at budgets, I think about power politics, but then I am also a creative person.","The 'X-Men' stories are the stories of outsiders: people who don't fit into normal society and are ostracised; it's a metaphor for gender, race, or sexual orientation.","I'm Kubrick without the O.C.D.","The thing that scares us the most is when familiar things operate in unfamiliar ways.","The best strategy for making people care about what happens is if they empathize with both sides. If you just have a Villain with a capital V, it becomes very two-dimensional.","There's a degree to which music bypasses our rational brain and accesses our emotional core in a way that's really visceral and allows you to make a strong impression on people without necessary delivering information.","There have been days where I've had two writers' rooms or three writers' rooms going, and you walk back and forth. And then you sort of throw yourself on the sofa, and you go, 'Just talk at me for, like, 20 minutes,' and my brain will catch up with this particular story. But I find that exciting.","I see myself as a first-draft writer, so when I sit down to write something, the first draft is usually pretty close to the end draft.","In the TV business, you've got to write fast, and someone will tell you, 'Can you rewrite this episode before... 6 P.M.?' So that's when you rewrite it. You can't wait for the muse to show up.","Half of a broadcast show, in my experience, is things happening, and the other half is people talking about how they feel about the things that happened. And so there's this sense of everyone saying their subtext out loud.","A novel is a relationship, you know? When you read a book, the writer has done half the work, and you're doing half the work. You're providing the imagination; the words are turning into pictures in your mind. There's an active relationship that's going on.","My goal is always to make something unpredictable that feels inevitable in the end. It's getting harder to do that. Audiences are so sophisticated and so smart.","You've got to give an audience something to root for. The minute you get into more dystopian shows, where everything's really dark, and no one has any hope, and there's no positive goal we're working toward, it's a bummer. You run out of gas with them. Because you need to know, 'What am I in this for? What am I rooting for?'","A book is full of ideas. You just live with what you read for so much longer. A lot of the times, nowadays, with a movie or TV show, it's like, 'Oh, it's entertainment!' And you never think about it again.","My mom never went to college, so she just assumed the writer identity, and that was always really inspiring to me. It's not something you need nine levels of education for. It's really an identity that you claim for yourself, and then you have to make yourself one.","Writing is this odd act, right? To sit and type, or write by hand, or whatever people do. And it requires a real discipline because it is really a sheer act of will that you're creating something, and you're doing it by yourself.","There's this common sense idea that in order to appeal to the biggest number of people, you have to write something very general, but my experience is the more specific you make something, the more people respond to it, in a very odd way.","Everyone always says that conflict is drama, and I agree, but I also don't think you need drama everywhere. Or conflict everywhere.","The first conversations I had for 'Legion' were right as the first year of 'Fargo' was ending. 'Daredevil' hadn't even begun then, so when signing on, I had no real sense of the onslaught that was coming.","I always feel like you can take a genre that has a familiar structure to it and then reinvent it as a character piece. Suddenly, what's old is new again. With 'Fargo,' I adapted a movie without any of the characters or the story. Yet somehow it feels like 'Fargo.'","When Fox asked me if I'd consider taking on The X-Men universe for television, my first thought was, 'What would you do with those stories or that genre that hasn't been done?'","For some reason, I tend to take on the stuff that people are really passionate about. If you make a list of people you don't want to offend, it's Vonnegut readers, comic book fans, and Coen brothers enthusiasts."],"Noah Munck":["Haiti is an amazing country. Even though the people there have so little, their attitudes resonate a crazy amount of love and joy. It is truly inspiring to see that. My love for the country starts with them.","I have been given much, and so I want to give as much as I can.","I love to work out.","I feel I should do everything I can to make a difference in Haiti. My main goal to help the people of Haiti is to give them homes, food, and jobs. It is heartbreaking to see little children sleeping on the ground in tents made of trash bags. I hope that we can put an end to this type of poverty not only in Haiti, but in the entire world.","I have a huge heart for Haiti and will tell the world how we can help!"],"Noah Taylor":["I've always held to the belief, though, that people who do too much acting training always look like they're acting, you know?","But, I'm a big Johnny Cash and a big Lou Reed fan and a Fellini fan.","To me that's what art is about - when you don't really have any control over your desires to do it.","It seems essential to try to find some meaning to life and I guess Jungian philosophy is the one that's helped me understand myself and the world more than anything else.","I think spirituality is a good thing but I dislike any sort of dogmatic organization.","Italy is definitely where I feel most at home, or alternatively, living in total wilderness, in the bush in Australia."],"Noah Webster":["No truth is more evident to my mind than that the Christian religion must be the basis of any government intended to secure the rights and privileges of a free people.","All the miseries and evils which men suffer from vice, crime, ambition, injustice, oppression, slavery and war, proceed from their despising or neglecting the precepts contained in the Bible.","When a citizen gives his suffrage to a man of known immorality he abuses his trust; he sacrifices not only his own interest, but that of his neighbor; he betrays the interest of his country.","In my view, the Christian religion is the most important and one of the first things in which all children, under a free government ought to be instructed.","It is the sincere desire of the writer that our citizens should early understand that the genuine source of correct republican principles is the bible, particularly the New Testament or the Christian religion.","The ecclesiastical establishments of Europe which serve to support tyrannical governments are not the Christian religion but abuses and corruptions of it.","The Bible must be considered as the great source of all the truth by which men are to be guided in government as well as in all social transactions."],"Noah Wyle":["I'm thinking about naming my first son Emmy so I can say I've got one. I want Emmy, Oscar and Tony - and my daughter Grammy.","Boy, oh, boy, people get jaded fast. I got nominated for an Emmy.","I'm a guy who never wanted to hold a steady job, because I was worried about the monotony.","It's weird, I actually like doing interviews now.","I think when you are named Noah, you are destined for a certain way of life.","Ever since I gave up therapy, it's my only time with a captive audience."],"Noam Bardin":["Maps are living, breathing organisms that change on a daily basis: You see it in new roads, bridge closures, and demolitions.","Using Waze, they're saving time on the road, money on gas, and emissions into the environment - a proposition they really can't turn down. But more than that, drivers use Waze because they feel they are part of a community, working together to overcome the global headache that is traffic.","Maybe at the end of the day, instead of a neighbor picking you up, a robot picks you up.","Overall, there isn't much difference between a high-end Android and iOS phone, despite the fact that Android is a knockoff of iOS.","Samsung and Apple seem to think that they're going to provide everything. Apple believes services will drive hardware, while Google wants to own each user regardless of hardware, so you have differing philosophies.","If you do not have vision to where you want your product to go, you will never get there.","You can see that tight integration, as Facebook and Twitter now have with iOS, makes the overall user experience better for both the partner and for Apple.","Our original plan when we founded Waze was to sell the data, and we could keep it ad-free that way.","We discovered that there are actually fewer companies actually buying data.","If you turn on ABC 7 in the morning San Francisco, you'll see them using an iPad with Waze on it, and actually talking about.","Basically we've taken our data and packaged it for TV station, and in return, they use us on air, and we get distribution.","What search is for the Web, maps are for mobile.","Advertisers want to get to mobile, and they don't want banner ads.","We struggle with this every single day - will third-party apps have room in the future of ecosystems?","We want to save every driver five minutes a day.","It's not in the interest of most mapping companies to make those changes as they occur, but if you give the power to local people, you can be sure that you're always getting the best information from the folks that actually drive those roads every day.","Can we get the average person on his way to work to pick someone up and drop them off once in a while?","Larry Page, Brian McClendon, and the Google Maps teams have been following our progress closely and are excited about what we've accomplished.","We are excited about the prospect of working with the Google Maps team to enhance our search capabilities and to join them in their ongoing efforts to build the best map of the world.","We will continue to make a real impact on drivers globally, helping them save time and money while making everyone's daily commute a bit more efficient and fun.","If you look at it now from the Google perspective, how do you make billions of dollars? Hundreds of millions doesn't count anymore; how do you make billions? And that's the question we've been tasked. Is this a Google-scale business, or is this a nice business for a startup?","What's been unique about our acquisition is that Google is leaving us independent. That actually means that the company is structured the same... We really are a company within a company.","For a start-up company, it is all about the religion of the product's excellence - the success of the product - while for a large corporation, it is the brand. We chose to maintain our start-up image."],"Noam Chomsky":["If we don't believe in freedom of expression for people we despise, we don't believe in it at all.","Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.","Changes and progress very rarely are gifts from above. They come out of struggles from below.","The internet could be a very positive step towards education, organisation and participation in a meaningful society.","Two days after the Boston marathon bombings, there was a drone strike in Yemen attacking a peaceful village, which killed a target who could very easily have been apprehended. But, of course, it is just easier to terrorise people. The drones are a terrorist weapon; they not only kill targets but also terrorise other people.","Everybody's worried about stopping terrorism. Well, there's a really easy way: stop participating in it.","With the development of industrial capitalism, a new and unanticipated system of injustice, it is libertarian socialism that has preserved and extended the radical humanist message of the Enlightenment and the classical liberal ideals that were perverted into an ideology to sustain the emerging social order.","Nationalism has a way of oppressing others.","Our only real hope for democracy is that we get the money out of politics entirely and establish a system of publicly funded elections.","There are two problems for our species' survival - nuclear war and environmental catastrophe - and we're hurtling towards them. Knowingly.","The more you can increase fear of drugs and crime, welfare mothers, immigrants and aliens, the more you control all the people.","A war with Pakistan would be an utter disaster.","Unlike Iran, Israel refuses to allow inspections at all, refuses to join the Non-Proliferation Treaty, has hundreds of nuclear weapons, has advanced delivery systems.","There are very few people who are going to look into the mirror and say, 'That person I see is a savage monster;' instead, they make up some construction that justifies what they do.","Wanton killing of innocent civilians is terrorism, not a war against terrorism.","I like the cold weather. It means you get work done.","For a privileged minority, Western democracy provides the leisure, the facilities, and the training to seek the truth lying hidden behind the veil of distortion and misrepresentation, ideology and class interest, through which the events of current history are presented to us.","If you don't like what someone has to say, argue with them.","In 1993, Israel and North Korea were moving towards an agreement in which North Korea would stop sending any missiles or military technology to the Middle East and Israel would recognize that country. President Clinton intervened and blocked it.","There's a tremendous gap between public opinion and public policy.","The public is not to see where power lies, how it shapes policy, and for what ends. Rather, people are to hate and fear one another.","Rational discussion is useful only when there is a significant base of shared assumptions.","There's plenty to criticize about the mass media, but they are the source of regular information about a wide range of topics. You can't duplicate that on blogs.","There's a lot of fuss on the Left about election irregularities, like, you know, the voting machines were tampered with, they didn't count the votes right, and so on. That's all accurate and of some importance, but of far more importance is the fact that elections just don't take place, not in any meaningful sense of the term 'election.'","It's a near miracle that nuclear war has so far been avoided.","If you're teaching today what you were teaching five years ago, either the field is dead or you are.","It's perfectly obvious that there is some genetic factor that distinguishes humans from other animals and that it is language-specific. The theory of that genetic component, whatever it turns out to be, is what is called universal grammar.","The Iraq War was the first conflict in western history in which an imperialist war was massively protested against before it had even been launched.","The Occupy movement did create spontaneously communities that taught people something: you can be in a supportive community of mutual aid and cooperation and develop your own health system and library and have open space for democratic discussion and participation. Communities like that are really important.","Education must provide the opportunities for self-fulfillment; it can at best provide a rich and challenging environment for the individual to explore, in his own way.","In the case of Yugoslavia v. NATO, one of the charges was genocide. The U.S. appealed to the court, saying that, by law, the United States is immune to the charge of genocide, self-immunized, and the court accepted that, so the case proceeded against the other NATO powers, but not against the United States.","The probability of apocalypse soon cannot be realistically estimated, but it is surely too high for any sane person to contemplate with equanimity.","The major advances in speed of communication and ability to interact took place more than a century ago. The shift from sailing ships to telegraph was far more radical than that from telephone to email!","Today, we have private airline companies, but if you take a look at a Boeing plane next time you travel, you'll see that you are basically taking a ride on a modified bomber.","Iran has little capacity to deploy force. Its strategic doctrines are defensive, designed to deter invasion long enough for diplomacy to set it.","In many respects, the United States is a great country. Freedom of speech is protected more than in any other country. It is also a very free society.","The deceit and distortion surrounding the American invasion of Vietnam is by now so familiar that it has lost its power to shock.","One of the best predictors of policy around is Thomas Ferguson's investment theory of politics, as he calls it - very outstanding political economist - which essentially - I mean, to say it in a sentence, he describes elections as occasions in which groups of investors coalesce and invest to control the state.","No matter what engineering field you're in, you learn the same basic science and mathematics. And then maybe you learn a little bit about how to apply it.","If a child from an Amazonian hunter-gatherer tribe comes to Boston, is raised in Boston, that child will be indistinguishable in language capacities from my children growing up here, and vice versa.","Intellectuals are in a position to expose the lies of governments, to analyze actions according to their causes and motives and often hidden intentions.","American imperialism is often traced to the takeover of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii in 1898.","Under the worst conditions, horrendous conditions, people still, you know, fight for their rights and don't just succumb.","Language is a process of free creation; its laws and principles are fixed, but the manner in which the principles of generation are used is free and infinitely varied. Even the interpretation and use of words involves a process of free creation.","Propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state.","If we choose, we can live in a world of comforting illusion.","In the early 1940s, as a young teenager, I was utterly appalled by the racist and jingoist hysteria of the anti-Japanese propaganda. The Germans were evil, but treated with some respect: They were, after all, blond Aryan types, just like our imaginary self-image. Japanese were mere vermin, to be crushed like ants.","The U.S. has the most dysfunctional healthcare system in the industrial world, has about twice the per capita costs, and some of the worst outcomes. It's also the only privatized system.","Debt is a trap, especially student debt, which is enormous, far larger than credit card debt. It's a trap for the rest of your life because the laws are designed so that you can't get out of it. If a business, say, gets in too much debt, it can declare bankruptcy, but individuals can almost never be relieved of student debt through bankruptcy.","Concentration of wealth yields concentration of political power. And concentration of political power gives rise to legislation that increases and accelerates the cycle.","It's dangerous when people are willing to give up their privacy.","The United States is unusual among the industrial democracies in the rigidity of the system of ideological control - 'indoctrination', we might say - exercised through the mass media.","You cannot control your own population by force, but it can be distracted by consumption.","When you look at a corporation, just like when you look at a slave owner, you want to distinguish between the institution and the individual. So slavery, for example, or other forms of tyranny, are inherently monstrous. The individuals participating in them may be the nicest guys you can imagine.","I stated that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are 'among the most unspeakable crimes in history.' I took no position on just where they stand on the scale of horrors relative to Auschwitz, the bombing of Chungking, Lidice, and so on.","There's a War Crimes Act in the United States passed by a Republican Congress in 1996, which says that grave breaches of the Geneva Convention are subject to the death penalty. And that doesn't mean the soldier that committed them - that means the commanders.","The principle that human nature, in its psychological aspects, is nothing more than a product of history and given social relations removes all barriers to coercion and manipulation by the powerful.","Unlimited economic growth has the marvelous quality of stilling discontent while maintaining privilege, a fact that has not gone unnoticed among liberal economists.","The Bible is one of the most genocidal books in history.","If the Nuremberg laws were applied, then every post-war American president would have been hanged.","Language is one component of the human cognitive capacity which happens to be fairly amenable to enquiry. So we know a good deal about that.","As international support for Obama's decision to attack Syria has collapsed, along with the credibility of government claims, the administration has fallen back on a standard pretext for war crimes when all else fails: the credibility of the threats of the self-designated policeman of the world.","Human language appears to be a unique phenomenon, without significant analogue in the animal world.","International affairs is very much run like the mafia. The godfather does not accept disobedience, even from a small storekeeper who doesn't pay his protection money. You have to have obedience; otherwise, the idea can spread that you don't have to listen to the orders, and it can spread to important places.","Growing up in the place I did I never was aware of any other option but to question everything.","The Internet has compromised the quality of debate.","Everyone who is critical of Israeli policy is deluged by crazed messages intended to flood their email system or, more insidiously, passwords are accessed and messages sent out under their name!

I thought it was smoke and mirrors.","In the US, there is basically one party - the business party. It has two factions, called Democrats and Republicans, which are somewhat different but carry out variations on the same policies. By and large, I am opposed to those policies. As is most of the population.","To say that the United States has pursued diplomacy with North Korea is a little bit misleading. It did under the Clinton administration, though neither side completely lived up to their obligations. Clinton didn't do what was promised, nor did North Korea, but they were making progress.","Significant anniversaries are solemnly commemorated - Japan's attack on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, for example.","It is true that classical libertarian thought is opposed to state intervention in social life, as a consequence of deeper assumptions about the human need for liberty, diversity, and free association.","Britain kept its position as the dominant world power well into the 20th century despite steady decline. By the end of World War II, dominance had shifted decisively into the hands of the upstart across the sea, the United States, by far the most powerful and wealthy society in world history.","From the U.S. point of view, negotiations are, in effect, a way for Israel to continue its policies of systematically taking over whatever it wants in the West Bank, maintaining the brutal siege on Gaza, separating Gaza from the West Bank and, of course, occupying the Syrian Golan heights, all with full U.S. support.","John Lewis Gaddis is not only the favorite historian of the Reagan administration, but he's regarded as the dean of Cold War scholarship, the leading figure in the American Cold War scholarship, a professor at Yale.","You never need an argument against the use of violence, you need an argument for it.","There's very little dislike of Americans in the world, shown by repeated polls, and the dissatisfaction - that is, the hatred and the anger - they come from acceptance of American values, not a rejection of them, and recognition that they're rejected by the U.S. government and by U.S. elites, which does lead to hatred and anger.","China is a great manufacturing center, but it's actually mostly an assembly plant. So it assembles parts and components, high technology that comes from the surrounding industrial - more advanced industrial centers - Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, the United States, Europe - and it basically assembles them.","All over the place, from the popular culture to the propaganda system, there is constant pressure to make people feel that they are helpless, that the only role they can have is to ratify decisions and to consume.","Everyone knows that when you look at a television ad, you do not expect to get information. You expect to see delusion and imagery.","When a politician uses the word 'folks,' we should brace ourselves for the deceit, or worse, that is coming.","The many questions about the bombing of Yugoslavia by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation - meaning primarily the United States - come down to two fundamental issues: 'What are the accepted and applicable 'rules of world order,' and how do these apply in the case of Kosovo?'","Censorship is never over for those who have experienced it. It is a brand on the imagination that affects the individual who has suffered it, forever.","Free speech has been used by the Supreme Court to give immense power to the wealthiest members of our society.","Popular struggles to bring about a freer and more just society have been resisted by violence and repression, and massive efforts to control opinion and attitudes. Over time, however, they have met with considerable success, even though there is a long way to go, and there is often regression.","The Federal Reserve has an official commitment to two different policies. One is to prevent inflation from getting too high. The second is to maintain high employment... the European Central Bank has only the first. It has no commitment to keep employment up.","Death and genitals are things that frighten people, and when people are frightened, they develop means of concealment and aggression. It is common sense.","Social Security is based on a principle. It's based on the principle that you care about other people. You care whether the widow across town, a disabled widow, is going to be able to have food to eat.","The term 'globalisation' is conventionally used to refer to the specific form of investor-rights integration designed by wealth and power, for their own interests.","States are not moral agents, people are, and can impose moral standards on powerful institutions.","Responsibility, I believe, accrues through privilege.","Obama's policies have been approximately the same as Bush's, though there have been some slight differences, but that's not a great surprise. The Democrats supported Bush's policies.","Sometimes I lose my temper.","The crimes against Palestinians in the Occupied Territories and elsewhere, particularly Lebanon, are so shocking that the only emotionally valid reaction is rage and a call for extreme actions. But that does not help the victims. And, in fact, it's likely to harm them.","Fidel Castro, whatever people may think of him, is a hero in Latin America, primarily because he stood up to the United States.","By very conservative estimates, Turkish repression of Kurds in the 1990s falls in the category of Kosovo. It peaked in the early 1990s; one index is the flight of more than a million Kurds from the countryside to the unofficial Kurdish capital, Diyarbakir, from 1990 to 1994, as the Turkish army was devastating the countryside.","If workers are more insecure, that's very 'healthy' for the society, because if workers are insecure, they won't ask for wages, they won't go on strike, they won't call for benefits; they'll serve the masters gladly and passively. And that's optimal for corporations' economic health.","The former colonies, in Latin America in particular, have a better chance than ever before to overcome centuries of subjugation, violence and foreign intervention, which they have so far survived as dependencies with islands of luxury in a sea of misery.","Spaniards were condemned for appeasing terrorism by voting for withdrawing troops from Iraq in the absence of U.N. authorization - that is, for taking a stand rather like that of 70 percent of Americans, who called for the U.N. to take the leading role in Iraq.","U.S. analysts estimate that Russian military expenditures have tripled during the Bush-Putin years, in large measure a predicted reaction to the Bush administration's militancy and aggressiveness.","I am opposed to the accumulation of executive power anywhere.","As a research tool, the internet is invaluable.","The Washington leadership has put aside non-proliferation programmes and devoted its energies and resources to driving the country to war by extraordinary deceit, then trying to manage the catastrophe it created in Iraq.","The Great Seal was an early proclamation of 'humanitarian intervention,' to use the currently fashionable phrase.","The intellectual tradition is one of servility to power, and if I didn't betray it I'd be ashamed of myself.","When General Allenby conquered Jerusalem during World War I, he was hailed in the American press as Richard the Lion-Hearted, who had at last won the Crusades and driven the pagans out of the Holy Land.","In societies that profess some respect for law, suspects are apprehended and brought to fair trial. I stress 'suspects.'","Humans have certain properties and characteristics which are intrinsic to them, just as every other organism does. That's human nature.","My speculation is that the U.S. does not want to establish the principle that it has to defer to some higher authority before carrying out the use of violence.","If you are giving a graduate course you don't try to impress the students with oratory, you try to challenge them, get them to question you.","When I was a college student and I got interested in linguistics the concern among students was, this is a lot of fun, but after we have done a structural analysis of every language in the world what's left? It was assumed there were basically no puzzles.","Greece has been, in many ways, a partially dysfunctional society. For example, the wealthy barely pay taxes... to an extent, that's true elsewhere, including the United States, but it's been pretty extreme in Greece.","The good news from the U.S. military survey of focus groups is that Iraqis do accept the Nuremberg principles. They understand that sectarian violence and the other postwar horrors are contained within the supreme international crime committed by the invaders.","By curious accident of history and geography, the world's major energy resources are located pretty much in Shiite regions. They're a minority in the Middle East, but they happen to be where the oil is, right around the northern part of the Gulf.","Civil disobedience is - it's no fun.","The greatest progress is in the sciences that study the simplest systems. So take, say, physics - greatest progress there. But one of the reasons is that the physicists have an advantage that no other branch of sciences has. If something gets too complicated, they hand it to someone else.","Civil disobedience's main goal typically is to try to arouse and inspire others to join and do something. Well, sometimes that is a good tactic, sometimes not.","Nicaragua dealt with the problem of terrorism in exactly the right way. It followed international law and treaty obligations. It collected evidence, brought the evidence to the highest existing tribunal, the International Court of Justice, and received a verdict - which, of course, the U.S. dismissed with contempt.","It is easier to go to the Internet than to go to the library, undoubtedly. But the shift from no libraries to the existence of libraries was a much greater shift than what we've seen with the Internet's development.","I do think that Magna Carta and international law are worth paying some attention to.","From the late 1940s, into and through the '50s, there developed a complex interaction between federal government, state and local government, real-estate interests, commercial interests and court decisions, which had the effect of undermining the mass transit system across the country.","In Egypt, on the eve of Tahrir Square, there was a major poll which found that overwhelmingly - 80-90%, numbers like that - Egyptians regarded the main threats they face as the U.S. and Israel. They don't like Iran - Arabs generally don't like Iran - but they didn't consider it a threat.","Guantanamo is still open, but it's unlikely that serious torture is going on at Guantanamo. There is just too much inspection.","I have often thought that if a rational Fascist dictatorship were to exist, then it would choose the American system.","Resistance is feasible even for those who are not heroes by nature, and it is an obligation, I believe, for those who fear the consequences and detest the reality of the attempt to impose American hegemony.","Since the civil war in Laos was resumed in earnest in 1963, American participation has been veiled in secrecy.","Libertarian socialism is properly to be regarded as the inheritor of the liberal ideals of the Enlightenment.","History shows that, more often than not, loss of sovereignty leads to liberalisation imposed in the interests of the powerful.","The appropriate response to terrorist crimes is police work, which has been successful worldwide."],"Nobu Matsuhisa":["Making sushi is an art, and experience is everything.","Sushi is something very exclusive. It is not like a McDonald's, not like a hot dog, not like a French fry. It's very high-class cooking in Japan.","I eat soup noodles for comfort. In fact, noodles of any kind. It's a food that is very easy to eat; it's very soothing and comfortable, too. If I could choose any, I'd say buckwheat was my favourite: it has a very good flavour and is healthy, too.","With sushi, it is all about balance. Sometimes they cut the fish too thick, sometimes too thin. Often the rice is overcooked or undercooked. Not enough rice vinegar or too much.","The first jolt I received in my life was when I lost my father in a motorcycle accident when I was eight. I would have been with him if he hadn't turned down my request to go out with him that afternoon.","You know how kids dream of being soccer players or actors? Well, my dream was to be a sushi chef.","The fine art of preparing sushi is something that you watch and learn.","A different spice is the most interesting thing to me.","A sushi chef has to spot the best-quality fresh fish instantly.","Peru was the Incas; it has 3,000 to 4,000 years of history.","I cannot bring myself to wear the Nobu hats, or the Nobu T-shirts. But the chef's jacket, that is mine. And when I wear it, I am very proud of myself.","Every year, I do a New Year's day party at my home. I invite my staff and my friends and their kids. Around 40-50 people come by, and I do a barbecue and salads, steak and sushi, and also lots of cheese.","I want to always keep going. I don't want to ever stop.","Businesses that run well are almost like marriages. Everything has to be up for discussion, or there will be real problems.","Many chefs are either technically or artistically better than me, but I know my food has soul.","In Tokyo, we have more three-star Michelin restaurants than Paris.","Whenever possible, buy a fish whole. With tuna, this isn't practical; with smaller fish, it is.","My cooking is very simple, so I don't really use machines at all. A knife, cutting board, frying pan and strainer are my essentials.","I love big shrimp, like Japanese botan shrimp and the meaty ones from Santa Barbara, Calif. In classic Japanese cooking, shrimp like these would be dropped into a broth or boiled as served with sushi. But I think boiling dilutes their great flavor, and they are better when stir-fried.","Every morning when I woke up, my mother was already in the kitchen making breakfast. It was always the same: steamed rice, pickled vegetables, grilled fish and miso soup. Each day there was something different in the soup such as tofu or potatoes.","I exercise every morning, no matter what. Sometimes it's tough to do right when you get off the plane, but after ten minutes you start sweating, and you always feel better.","I like both potatoes and rice. You can do a lot with both of them. But if I could eat only one carbohydrate for the rest of my life, I wouldn't choose bread, potatoes or even noodles. I'd go for rice instead; I eat more of that than anything else.","It's still my happiest time when I'm eating.","What I relish most is when a member of my staff, who has worked with passion and patience towards achieving their dream of owning a restaurant, walks up to me and says, 'Nobu! I have done it!'","Have you ever been to Mexico City and haggled with the locals over souvenirs? Well, in Peru, you had to negotiate like that to get the freshest fish at the market.","Cooking is like fashion. Always, I like to try to change. If I'm traveling in a different country - to Australia, the Bahamas, Budapest, Moscow - and I see a new ingredient, I like to try it in a new dish.","One evening, Mike Myers and Steven Spielberg were discussing 'Goldmember,' and I just happened to joke, 'If you need a Japanese character, let me know!' The next day, they called me for audition! I find it's always helpful to maintain a sense of humour.","When I'm home in L.A., I go to La Brea, a bakery which does artisan breads, excellent sourdoughs primarily, but also patisserie and cakes.","I grew up in the countryside in Saitama prefecture, north of Tokyo.","I was a bit of a wild boy - always swimming and exploring the mountains.","Once I fell out of a tree and was hit by a motorbike. I still have the scar on my head now.","When I was 11 or 12 - a young boy in Japan - one of my older brothers took me to a sushi restaurant. I had never been to one, and it was very memorable. Back then, sushi was expensive and hard to come by, not like today, when there's a sushi restaurant on every street corner and you can buy it in supermarkets.","Chefs are artists, and I couldn't be happy with my art if I was forced to use cheap ingredients.","Napa cabbage is very beautiful, all those long, pale leaves with ruffled edges.","One day, the people who work in my kitchen stir-fried chopped Napa cabbage to serve with some meat or fish for their own dinner. I got to thinking: 'What if the cabbage was the most important thing on the plate?'","I remember watching steak being cooked on TV and wanting to try it. As a special treat, my mother cooked it for me, and I thought this would be the time I would eat with a knife and fork. Alas, I ate it with chopsticks!","I'm a lucky person because the company keeps growing, and that means my team keeps growing.","I used to watch my mother cooking when I was a child; she influenced me a lot.","Shellfish is better to buy live. In the U.S., because we eat oysters and clams raw, it is very important that they are alive before we prepare them. It's important to look for a closed shell. If a clam is alive, the shell will be closed. Never buy clams if the shell is open.","Large fish such as tuna are shown already cut into fillets and bought by the block. Fillets should be almost transparent. Avoid tuna that looks rainbow-colored or black.","I'm not perfect. I am not Iron Man.","Of course the Japanese and Peruvian fish are different, but it's the same Pacific Ocean. They are different, but I know fish.","It's true that cilantro has a strange, strong flavor. People seem to love it or not like it at all. Even I didn't like it at first when I had it in Peru. But I got used to it - it's hard not to in South America - and now I can't live without it.","One of my favorite ways to use cilantro is in a beautiful clear soup with monkfish and lime. It's a great dish for cooler weather, especially because monkfish is very good in fall and winter. Also, I like the meatiness and rich texture of monkfish.","I can't imagine Japanese food without dashi, a broth made with kelp and dried bonito flakes. It has the aroma of the sea, tinged with a subtle smokiness, and adds a very important, distinct flavor.","Dashi remains unfamiliar to most French and American cooks, who tend to reach for a bouillon cube to do many of the same things. But dashi is worth preparing and using the way the Japanese do: for poaching fish, as a soup base, and in simmered dishes.","It's not unusual for me to wake up in the middle of the night and not know where I am. I take sleep medication to deal with all the flights. But I find it helps to eat at the same time every day.","I can live without a computer. My assistant checks my e-mails.","My favorite knife is from Miyakoya in Japan - I have one in each of my restaurants.","I started cooking when I was 18 years old, and now I have restaurants all over the world.","I enjoy people who have passion, whether it is as a musician or whatever they do. All people who have success keep it very basic. Try your best. But without passion, you will not have success.","My business partner Robert De Niro knows a lot about hotels; he opened the Greenwich Hotel in New York City.","When I'm in L.A., I go to Spago because the chef is a friend of mine.","I don't go out much.","Eating a lot on the plane is not good for jet lag.","My flight time is important to me; I actually prefer a longer flight to a short one. That way I have time to read a book, watch movies, and think about new dishes.","I always eat a meal at home before I leave for the airport, so I only eat the soup and salad on the plane.","I learned from my first restaurant: Make customers happy, make sure the customer comes back again. And automatically, success has followed me.","In the morning and the end of every day, I thank that I'm alive.","People who make mistakes but try their best, other people will support. But people who make mistakes because they're lazy, nobody supports.","In my generation, there was no sushi school, no cooking school, so people have to learn from working.","Cooking and film are completely different - but I'd rather stay in the kitchen than be in movies.","I feel like I owe something to America, as it is where I found success.","Los Angeles is my home - I have my wife and two daughters growing up there.","I travel all over the world, usually 10 months out of the year. I stay at a lot of hotels, and the ones I like best are clean and not complicated. You go to bed and say, 'Wow, I feel comfortable.'","In Japan, I have my own line of dinnerware, but I'm not aggressive about pursuing those projects.","I like to keep healthy physically and mentally, too.","Some hotels have a lot of mirrors, chairs, you can't find the plugs, the music is complicated. But the Nobu concept is beautiful, simple.","If I am at home in L.A. on a Saturday or Sunday, I like to start the day with a hot bath and then do an hour of stretching.","Swimming keeps me fit and flexible, and it helps that I have a large pool at my house in Beverly Hills.","One of my great loves is golf. When I am in L.A., I like to play with a few close friends: no phones, no distractions, the great outdoors and the chance to bet some money to keep it interesting.","I like Mercedes because my wife has been in two big accidents and emerged without a scratch, thanks to the safety of these cars.","I am very lucky to consider many of my business associates friends. Some are closer than others, but I respect and value all of them.","People eat the chicken, people eat the beef, they still say, 'Don't kill the fish.'","When I'm dining out privately, I tend to avoid fine-dining venues; I like things to feel casual.","When I set up my first restaurant, I was so inspired by Wolfgang Puck, who is also based in L.A. and is now a good friend of mine, and the way he would engage with his customers and greet them personally.","I have a restaurant in Milan, and Paper Moon is five minutes away from my hotel, so I always go there for lunch. It's a casual place that serves good salad, pizza and pasta; the space is tight with tables close together, and it feels buzzy. Food comes out fast, too.","My cooking is simply ingredients plus umami."],"Nobuo Uematsu":["However, very recently I have come to an understanding that complex music is not necessarily pleasant.","However in countries outside of Japan I think game music is still a potential growth market that has not yet developed to the extent that we are seeing in Japan.","I believe that there are still people who believe that game music is something equal to just an effect incorporated into the game, something like a BGM. And therefore this is something that I would like to show that is not true.","As you may know my use of Celtic music is extremely simple and short. However there is something about it that will remain in your mind for a long, long time.","Certainly my only interest is not in Celtic music.","For over ten years or so game music has developed into a very large market.","I always begin to compose the melody first.","I don't know anyone who would be exclusively working on game music, per se.","I guess many game music fans prefer original soundtrack albums.","I have been interested in Irish traditional music for the past few years.","So I don't really have a clear plan, in terms of music, as to where I want to head in the future.","There's some familiarity in Celtic music, even if you've never heard that piece of music before.","And as far as the Disney Concert hall is concerned, it is a wonderful modern structure and I am extremely honored that I had this opportunity to have a concert here.","However now we can create a sound that can truly startle someone and in terms of sound effects I think the environment that we are in now has improved dramatically.","I think that American people really know how to pursue fun, they really know how to have a good time. Japanese are somewhat more reserved than Americans, so I'm jealous.","We hope that eventually there would be an occasion which I can personally prove that game music can in fact impress many different people and move them.","When you talk about the Final Fantasy series, the series started selling better after 7, and that was the base idea for the center of the set list for the LA concert.","And it's very strange, but I think there is something very common - not only in Celtic music - but there is a factor or element in Celtic music that is similar in music that we find in Japan, the United States, Europe, and even China and other Asian countries.","I believe that there are many interesting projects that are potentially possible for me other than game music, and therefore in my mind there are several things that are being contemplated.","I just initiated the project where I write music for somebody else to write the lyrics and also for the orchestra to perform. I've just initiated the project. That leads the project into creating an independent label outside of game music.","It was very difficult to startle or surprise someone with a particular sound during the family computer era.","Last year in Germany at a town hall in Leipzig there was a game music concert played by the orchestra and some of the Final Fantasy scores were played. This year there is another concert scheduled in the same location, for game music.","The second album of Black Mages is currently in the process of recording and the basic tracks have already been completed. Hopefully sometime in the future we will be able to have a concert.","Well, rather than to give you my impression on Los Angeles, per se, my older sister's husband is and American, therefore I have a pretty good idea of the, perhaps the characteristics of Americans in general."],"Noel Clarke":["I just started to write because I was fed up of not seeing the stories that I wanted, so I was like 'Stop moaning and write something.'","I think the British industry is set up to support British film, if we make films that enable them to support it. If you don't make a commercial film, distributors can't get behind it. If they don't get behind it, the film doesn't do well.","I'm a nice guy to anyone I meet, until they show me they don't deserve niceness. I'll turn very quickly. But I'm pretty pleasant overall.","I did 'Kidulthood' and 'Adulthood,' and that's what people wanted and expect me to always do. They want me to do 'hood films and be the guy swinging baseball bats and saying 'Yo Blood' and beating up others in the street.","People can criticise me all day long. It just washes off me. You might as well be talking to a wall.","I'd always much rather be second choice on anything because it makes you work harder.","I'm just who I am. I don't try to change myself for other people.","I think it's important that we have a new batch of British film-makers that aren't doing the same old stuff. And that includes me.","I can't always be making 'British films.' Why should we be making films about corsets and horses and girls learning to drive when Americans send over an event movie and make five or 10 million?","I don't think I'm egotistical, and I know what my limits are: I'm a black guy who's probably losing his hair. But I'm happy to play roles that I'm given, and I'm happy to play roles that I write.","After 'Kidulthood,' I was called in to a meeting and told that I didn't write women very well. I was very annoyed.","I was offered and accepted a part in 'A Few Best Men,' and then the Australian actor's union argued that there were too many British actors. And the director decided to lose me.","I think most people, no matter their status now, have big screen TVs, because they're the standard TVs now. And so why would you go to the cinema?","Generally, an indie film in the U.K. is put together much like in the states. We got a tax credit. You sell the domestic rights, which can be quite low, but it's enough to push you over the line. And you get a tax credit on top of that, and then you cobble it together with private equity or gap financing and things like that.","My past films came out on home entertainment in the U.S., so the next question was, how do we get a theatrical in the U.S.? Well, you put a monster in it. That will do it, because people love monster movies.","When I wrote 'Kidulthood,' I didn't even know there was going to be a 'Kidulthood.' I just wanted to test myself to see if I could write a script.","I wouldn't say that I'm a jack-of-all-trades, master of none, but I wouldn't say that I'm brilliant at any.","'Pulp Fiction' blew my mind; beforehand, I'd watch films and there was a beginning, middle and an end, and that's it. There is in that film, too, but it's out of sequence.","I don't like doing things that are too easy.","I couldn't tell you the ratio, but probably for every job you see me do, there would be 20 rejections.","I don't think anyone expected me to get the BAFTA. The bookies didn't have me down. It's definitely made a huge difference in my career, but I don't dwell on it.","I think that's important for all ages, to not be afraid of being an individual. I grew up on my own, as an only child, so early on I think I was quite capable of making decisions by myself and being an individual."],"Noel Coward":["If you must have motivation, think of your paycheck on Friday.","It is discouraging how many people are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit.","I have a memory like an elephant. In fact, elephants often consult me.","I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me.","I'll go through life either first class or third, but never in second.","Wit ought to be a glorious treat like caviar; never spread it about like marmalade.","We have no reliable guarantee that the afterlife will be any less exasperating than this one, have we?","I've sometimes thought of marrying - and then I've thought again.","It's discouraging to think how many people are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit.","Squash - that's not exercise, it's flagellation.","I'm not a heavy drinker, I can sometimes go for hours without touching a drop.","Just say the lines and don't trip over the furniture.","People are wrong when they say opera is not what it used to be. It is what it used to be. That is what's wrong with it.","The higher the building the lower the morals.","Never mind, dear, we're all made the same, though some more than others.","Let's drink to the spirit of gallantry and courage that made a strange Heaven out of unbelievable Hell, and let's drink to the hope that one day this country of ours, which we love so much, will find dignity and greatness and peace again.","Work is much more fun than fun.","Mona Lisa looks as if she has just been sick, or is about to be.","I don't believe in astrology. The only stars I can blame for my failures are those that walk about the stage.","Someday I suspect, when Jesus has definitely got me for a sunbeam, my works may be adequately assessed.","I love criticism just so long as it's unqualified praise.","My body has certainly wandered a good deal, but I have an uneasy suspicion that my mind has not wandered enough.","I have always paid income tax. I object only when it reaches a stage when I am threatened with having nothing left for my old age - which is due to start next Tuesday or Wednesday.","That strange feeling we had in the war. Have you found anything in your lives since to equal it in strength? A sort of splendid carelessness it was, holding us together.","Extraordinary how potent cheap music is.","Success took me to her bosom like a maternal boa constrictor.","There's always something fishy about the French."],"Noel Fisher":["I went through some tough years when I first moved to Los Angeles, and 'The Riches' was my first major success.","When I was a kid, my parents encouraged me to take many different classes. Piano was one that I really fell in love with.","I think you should check out 'Battle: Los Angeles' because it really is a sci-fi movie, but it's not. It's not like anything you've seen before. The best way to describe it is it's a war movie that happens to have aliens as the enemy.","I'm just looking for good work. I just really love acting, and I'd like to jump on something that's really exciting for me.","Something that I really enjoy doing is creating and being a part of very different characters and very different projects.","The whole goal for me with my career is just follow good projects and good parts and challenge myself as much as I can.","'Hatfields & McCoys' is a very profound statement in what happens when you're unable to let go of hatred and hurt and unable to have any kind of goodness in your life."],"Noel Gallagher":["You've got to be strong enough for love. It's very easy to be cool and cynical. It's very difficult to just let yourself go and be in love. You've got to be strong enough for that.","I don't live to work; I work to live.","We're not arrogant, we just believe we're the best band in the world.","I'm a happy-go-lucky character. I'm not that miserable. But I can never let anyone into my world.","When I'm doing music and I'm on the road, I love it. But once I'm home, it's very difficult to go back out on the road.","Oasis were the last great, traditional rock-n'-roll band. We came along before the Internet so, if you wanted to see us, you had to be there. It makes me feel like a righteous old man.","I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me.","I'm not interested in making money. It's just that with my talent, I'm cursed with it.","Rock n' roll to me is all about freedom of thought and to be whatever you want to be.","What's problematic about playing stadiums and driving around in private jets and drinking champagne at 8 o'clock in the morning? What's wrong with that? I haven't got a problem with that. I can't fathom why people would.","I'm against people downloading music.","If everyone in the music business were brutally honest about what their intentions were then you could sort things out, but it's all smoke and mirrors.","You've just got to trust your instincts and realize that you can't please all the people all the time. You've got to please yourself ultimately in the end.","When I was 16 I'd watch 'The Godfather,' but I didn't think, 'Right, I'm going to go down the barber's and get some protection money off him.'","Fame is something that is bestowed upon you because of success. Success is something you have to chase.","I've grown to love California: It's the dream of every English musician to come here and work in the sunshine. To walk up Sunset Boulevard, knowing you're going to make music - that's it.","I've never felt like I had anything important to say.","I've never understood musicians who don't enjoy doing promotional interviews. I just can't believe it. I always think, 'Your life must have been so brilliant before you were in a band.'","Great music is in the ear of the beholder.","I don't think we live in those times when great art comes out of great adversity.","In business, you can have one massive success that earns $50 million overnight, and that's it. You're successful. End of story. But in the music business, you have to keep on doing it.","There's enough music in the world. There are enough rock stars.","We shouldn't need riot police at schools.","I remember the '70s constantly being winter in Manchester and the Irish community in Manchester closing ranks because of the IRA bombings in Birmingham and Manchester, and you know the bin-workers' strike, all wrapped up in it... They were violent times. Violence at home and violence at football matches.","Producers like to record all the drums first, then they do the bass, then all the guitars, so you're constantly moving from one song to another.","If I can give you any advice, it's this: every hour that you spend sat on the couch doing nothing, put it to good use, because when you have kids, an hour is like a lifetime.","Solo artists are generally totally insane. Elton John? Slightly eccentric. George Michael? He's mad as custard.","I go into Daunt Books in Marylebone every couple of weeks. My wife Sara demolishes books, but I only buy stuff occasionally. I like boys' things, spies and the Cold War.","I don't much like 'Wonderwall,' but the effect that song has on people, I can't deny it.","There's nothing good on the news. You're not telling me CNN is all cats in trees, are you? Nothing can be that good if Piers Morgan is in it, you know what I mean?","There's no reason, ever, to be late. Or early.","When a lot of musicians change styles, their songwriting suffers because they want to be different.","To be quite honest, John Lennon had questionable politics. There was a flip side. He was all peace and love, but he was a very violent character.","If I were in the Beatles, I'd be a good George Harrison.","With every song that I write, I compare it to the Beatles. The thing is, they only got there before me. If I'd been born at the same time as John Lennon, I'd have been up there.","I've always been into guitars... we want to put keyboards on, but keyboard players don't look cool onstage, they just keep their heads down. There has never been a cool keyboard player, apart from Elton John.","Americans are crazy. They have this fascination with throwing their shoes on stage. I've been to a lot of shows in me life, some good and some bad. But I was never moved to take off me shoes and throw it at the lead singer.","Chart positions are for people with manbags who get to work at 11 A.M. because they've been at a digital meeting.","When you're in a band and there's five of you, you have to accommodate five people in every song.","I have 3 kids and a cat and a busy, noisy house. I get more time to relax when I'm working.","The charts are only relevant when you're top of them!","I don't fall into the category of tortured artist. But it's not made me more or less anything.","You can't afford to think about what might have been. You just be aware of what is.","America is incredibly professional and corporate.","American sports are quite masculine. And football - although it's still played by men all over the world - football compared to American football is quite feminine in its artistry. And there's no padding. It's America's loss, though.","Tony Blair is a brilliant politician. Unfortunately, his legacy is entwined with George W. Bush because of Iraq.","I don't have the genetic make up of a frontman, but I'm learning how to do it.","Even in the nineties, when it was mad and there were photographers all around the house, it never occurred to me to send someone else out to get cigarettes. It took me five minutes - went for a walk, gave a wave, went back inside.","I started off as many fathers do. I enjoyed the good bits, but I was wary of the responsibility. But now I love being a dad.","Kids and family life are only as good as your wife, and she's amazing.","Oasis can't be summed up in one word. I could do a sentence: Boys from council estate made it very, very big.","It's a sad state when more people retweet than buy records.","Under Thatcher, who ruled us with an iron rod, great art was made. Amazing designers and musicians. Acid house was born. Very colourful and progressive.","Making records should be fun.","When you're the cash cow that lays the golden goose egg, people are always going to cheer you on, whatever.","Women have nine months more experience than you do - nine months to prepare for being a parent.","I do think my old fella wasn't much of a... I don't remember him ever being a 'dad' dad. He was too busy working. It was a hard life, man.","I love the Bee Gees, but only the pre-disco stuff. From '64 to '69, I've got all their albums.","People say I seem very negative about new music - well, if somebody asks me what I think of Keane, I'll tell 'em. I don't like 'em. I'll obviously take it a step too far and grossly insult the keyboard player's mam or summat, but I'm afraid that's just me.","My first instinct when I write songs is not a negative one. It's something positive... Everything I've ever done has some form of hope in it, I think.","Every song that I play I wrote by myself.","I don't like being on television when I'm playing live. I don't even like being on Jools Holland or any of them programs.","I'm a little bit of a control freak when it comes to my music, unfortunately.","Why is the rest of the world so overcrowded? Nobody lives in America! We're all squashed up on top of each other in London.","I've got my own style on the guitar, sure, and I play rhythm in a certain way, and I use certain inflections. People have said that to me, and I understand it.","I know there's bands that might write something that sounds like The Smiths, and they'll go, 'Oh, it sounds like The Smiths, we've got to make it sound not like The Smiths.'","Music is a thing that changes people's lives. It has the capacity to make young people's lives better.","There's not enough good things in the world.","Gone are the days when Virgin Records was owned by Richard Branson, a fan of music. Now they're all owned by some guy who bought it off some guy who bought it off some guy who wants a return on his investment.","My son ain't going to be miserable because he's going to be the child of a rock star, the end.","Frontmen come alive when they come onstage.","I'm not technically proficient enough to attempt all kinds of music.","I'm used to people being a mile away. That suits me. It's more nerve-wracking playing in front of people who are two feet away from me.","I absolutely loved being famous. It was all great, up until the point when it wasn't.","You have to make the effort with children. You can't have them thinking that I reckon I'm special, otherwise they'll start thinking they're special. I want them to feel normal for as long as possible because God knows they'll reach an age when they'll be told they're not.","I first came to London when I was 22 and working as a roadie. Having watched the 'News At Ten' all my life, I thought Big Ben was going to be massive, but I was underwhelmed.","You can't be a mod and a rocker. You have to choose sides.","As I get older, I don't aggressively pursue songs. All the great ones just appear.","Anything that's of any use, famous people get hold of it and take it for themselves and it gets a bad rap.","I don't think people need to know what colour socks I'm wearing today; I don't think people need to know what shower gel I'm using. There's too much information in the world, and there's no magic or mystery anymore.","I love the NFL. I don't have a team per se, but I'm into it.","You can't really write a full album about your missus. She'll start getting the wrong idea and start thinking I like her.","You can't put a load of rockstars up on a stage and expect to wipe out global poverty. That's ludicrous.","I like Chris Martin. I think he's a really great songwriter.","You'll find people who rib you about their age are petrified about getting old. It doesn't bother me.","Twenty years from now, will we listen to Lady Gaga? No. She might think she is making a stand for the freaks and the weirdos. But they're not going to have any decent music to play, are they?","You don't have to be great to be successful. Look at Phil Collins.","Rock stardom will die because nobody will make enough money any more to be rock stars.","For the record, I Iike Jay-Z. That's my opinion.","These fledgling democracies in the Middle East, they're actually fighting for their freedom. And what are they rioting for in England? Leisurewear.","I've never been asked to do a collaboration. I guess I just don't give off that come-and-get-me vibe. I wouldn't be adverse to doing one with Coldplay or U2 - anyone who sells 50 million albums.","My kids have got to work themselves around my life, not the other way. That's how kids become brats, if you're there staring at them all the time going, 'Are you alright?'","I can make going to the dry-cleaners last an entire day, and the dry cleaners might be 150 yards from my front door. You might find it hard to believe, but I am bone-idle lazy.","Every album I've ever been involved in, on the day that it came out I believed in it.","My wife would say I'm not romantic at all, but I would say that I'm the ultimate romancer because I write about... life being brilliant."],"Noel Redding":["Everybody was starting to grow long hair and wear pink suits and purple glasses and stuff and then, I suppose, some people thought we were crazy, but we weren't really crazy because we're all still here!","On Ain't No Telling I came up with the bass solo.","My personal favourite is Jeff Beck. All the others are wonderful as well.","I wouldn't know how I would have coped with The Beatles' sort of fame.","My lady, Deborah McNaughton is doing a documentary on me.","At the age of nine, playing the violin at school, and then onto the mandolin.","I took up violin because my best mate had taken it up, so I did likewise.","The first band I was in, I think was called The Strangers. I got the sack because I was too small!","I'd gone professional when I was about seventeen.","I came to join the Experience by going for an audition for Eric Burdon who was just forming the New Animals at that point, after the original Animals had broken up.","I was the first guy to join the band with Hendrix.","Well, the first day we went through three songs, very basically.","Hendrix rehearsed different drummers, before we met Mitch Mitchell.","I suppose the old natural stuff would be ok, the old mushroom, but I wouldn't advise anyone to do it.","But people are now realising why I was playing bass with Hendrix.","It was rehearsing in the studio, at which point they were setting up the sound, and once we'd got the thing together they'd actually record it, without us knowing sometimes!","We had no sleep or days off or anything like that and then, when the band became big, Hendrix became a star and looked down at us lot.","Well, I'd had the Fat Mattress earlier as a writing outlet for songs and that.","The Fat Mattress consisted of people I'd played with before joining the 'Experience and it was put together as a song writing situation."],"Noel Riley Fitch":["Dead or alive, interesting people are interesting people.","Whether in print or other media, a good biography is more than a court record or a stringing together of already familiar sources. It breathes life into the subject."],"Noel Wells":["For all of my class projects, I somehow turned it into a commercial parody or put on plays. My whole thing was seeing things from a big picture, from beginning to middle to end: making a costume, doing voices, writing a script, making it all happen.","I'm sure there have been a lot of boys I've chased over the years that has been fueled by alcohol and stupidity. But that's kind of how things happen - sometimes you have to do something really stupid, and sometimes it works out, and sometimes you fall flat on your face.","I feel like I grew up being babysat by a television, and all I ever wanted to do was be in movies, direct movies, make movies, but it took me a really long time to be honest with myself about it because my background is that my family was very poor.","As a kid, I think people would have described me more as a goofball, or being energetic. But I always loved parodies; I loved spoofing things.","I'm one of those people who had Christmas and my birthday always combined, and generally, my birthday was pretty much ignored. But my parents are always good about making some kind of special effort to make me feel like I also have a birthday that exists.","Just as performers, I think you'd be an idiot not to utilize YouTube.","I think the process of 'SNL' is still pretty formal. You make an audition tape, your agent sends it in, they watch people's tapes, and then they invite people to perform at a comedy club in Los Angeles or New York. But I don't know how much actual scouting they do online."],"Noemie Lenoir":["I am not complaining; I had a beautiful childhood - we didn't have a lot of money, but there was always food on the table, and my parents saved money so that in the holidays we would all get in the car and drive to the mountains. I have amazing parents.","It is important to me that people believe in me as a model, trust in me as a model - which they do in London and New York - which is why sometimes I think I'm an Anglo-Saxon woman at heart.","I can't say modeling is a hard job. And it brings the money home.","I come from a really poor family, and when I started doing campaigns, it changed everything for my family. I am not complaining; I had a beautiful childhood - we didn't have a lot of money, but there was always food on the table, and my parents saved money so that in the holidays we would all get in the car and drive to the mountains.","I have amazing parents. They had worked hard all their lives for me, and when I started to make money, I wanted to be able to take care of them.","I think if you don't trust in yourself, it helps to trust in something else."],"Nolan Bushnell":["Everyone who's ever taken a shower has an idea. It's the person who gets out of the shower, dries off and does something about it who makes a difference.","Hire for passion and intensity; there is training for everything else.","I just want the future to happen faster. I can't imagine the future without robots.","Innovation is hard. It really is. Because most people don't get it. Remember, the automobile, the airplane, the telephone, these were all considered toys at their introduction because they had no constituency. They were too new.","Today, companies have to radically revolutionize themselves every few years just to stay relevant. That's because technology and the Internet have transformed the business landscape forever. The fast-paced digital age has accelerated the need for companies to become agile.","Walk to work, even if it's four miles. Ride a bike to work. Drive a different way. On your way there, try to find beauty. You'd be surprised how much more of the neighborhood you can perceive and experience when you're looking for unique spots of beauty.","The ultimate inspiration is the deadline.","These days when you say 'videogame', people think of immersive games that take over your life and require three thumbs to control. My goal is to create games that almost retreat into the background. I'm interested in bringing them back to their role as a social facilitator, the way party games help people to interact.","I guess I'd like to be known for being an innovator, fostering creativity, thinking outside the box. You know, keeping people playful.","I'm the only one who was predicting the Nintendo Wii would beat Sony's PlayStation 3.","I've always thought legal addictions are a great way to create a business. Starbucks is a wonderful example.","I hate 'Mafia Wars'.","Everybody believes in innovation until they see it. Then they think, 'Oh, no; that'll never work. It's too different.'","We had some really powerful technology - Atari always was a technology-driven company, and we were very keen on keeping the technological edge on everything. There's a whole bunch of things that we innovated. We made the first computer that did stamps or sprites, we did screen-mapping for the very first time, and a lot of stuff like that.","Creativity is every company's first driver. It's where everything starts, where energy and forward motion originate. Without that first charge of creativity, nothing else can take place.","You wanna build your IQ higher in the next two years? Be uncomfortable. That means, learn something where you have a beginner's mind.","One of the big concerns I have is that most of the HR departments in a lot of companies are hiring away from creativity and they don't know it. For instance, they are requiring everybody to have a college degree. The most creative people I know couldn't deal with college.","We didn't do a square ball in 'Pong' because we thought it was cool. We did it because that was all we could do.","I founded Atari in my garage in Santa Clara while at Stanford. When I was in school, I took a lot of business classes. I was really fascinated by economics. You end up having to be a marketeer, finance maven and a little bit of a technologist in order to get a business going.","A good interviewer is able to ferret out what the applicant is really passionate about. Ask them what they do for fun, what they're reading, try and find out if they have a life outside of work.","I basically look at PR as something you do if there's an object in mind. But my ego doesn't need it.","Women were very, very good at 'Pong'. It was part of the dating scene. The number of people who told me they met their wife or husband playing 'Pong' was huge. They were shoulder to shoulder, talking and playing. It was body contact and verbal contact.","Young adults love to play games and they're thirsty for social interaction, but a lot of bar and restaurant experiences are quite unsatisfactory on the social level. What young people need is a place that has the feel of an unhosted party where they find themselves interacting with like-minded strangers.","I believe there are Steve Jobses all around us. Really, what is happening is that they're being edited out of importance.","A lot of what is wrong with corporate America has to do with a culture filled with antibodies trained to expel anything different. HR departments often want cookie cutter employees, which inevitably results in cookie cutter solutions.","'Grand Theft Auto', in its deification of antisocial behavior, is where I heap the most of my scorn.","The truly creative people tend to be outliers.","Sometimes when you hire people who have to pass a Mr. Congeniality test, you end up losing some of the non-conformists who will give you different views and perspectives.","I never, ever, saw the evil Steve Jobs. He was always the most well-mannered and respectful guy I knew. And we got to be pretty good friends. He didn't suffer fools gladly. I guess he didn't think I was a fool.","I think 'Something Ventured' is a nice piece because it celebrates venture capital in a unique and powerful way.","Radical innovation is difficult to fund. It seems scary. And the really radical things seem even more scary.","In the early days of the video game business, everybody played. The question is, what happened? My theory - and I think it's pretty well borne out - is that in the '80s, games got gory, and that lost the women. And then they got complex, and that lost the casual gamer.","Atari showed that young people could start big companies. Without that example it would have been harder for Jobs and Bill Gates, and people who came after them, to do what they did.","When I was running Atari, violence against humanoid figures was not allowed. We'd let you shoot at a tank... but we drew the line at shooting at people, with blood splattering everywhere.","The subtle generational cues that make one thing cool and another uncool aren't always obvious to a parent. My children are my dinner-table sounding board. I've come up with some wonderful ideas that they universally dismissed as 'lame.'","Every company needs to have a skunkworks, to try things that have a high probability of failing. You try to minimize failure, but at the same time, if you're not willing to try things that are inherently risky, you're not going to make progress.","The game business reinvents itself every five years.","Do I really want to do a mobile game that's one of 300,000, where discoverability is everything? You really have to have a little more sizzle on the steak. I would rather be one of 100 apps for Google Glass than one of 300,000 for iOS and Android.","The idea is to become a best-selling author first and then the rest of my books will be slam dunks.","We're moving away from a credentialed society to a merit society.","I've always been a tech-head.","Some of the best projects to ever come out of Atari or Chuck E. Cheese's were from high school dropouts, college dropouts. One guy had been in jail.","I had an awful lot of my soul invested in Atari culture.","I want to fix education in the world. As soon as I work on that, I am going to work on world hunger and then world peace.","All schools will end up using game metrics in the future.","Remember that we can only in our forebrains handle 5-7 items. Our backbrains can handle massive amounts. So when you're given a problem, think about it before you go sleep, and chances are you can solve it by the next morning.","There are a lot of things about having money that are perceived to be cool but that aren't. Maybe if you're a CEO jerk who likes going coast to coast by himself in a G4, then that's fine. But that's not me. And it never will be.","I try to get a vision of the future, and then I try to figure out where the discontinuities are.","People like secrets. Creative people really like secrets.","I've been in navigation systems, robotics, restaurants, communications systems, touch screens, and now I'm back in games. I like to say I have five-year A.D.D.","The thing we don't want to do is overstate the benefits, but there is all kinds of proof that exercise, both physical and mental, increases brain activity.","Learning ballroom dancing is great for your brain. But it only works for three to six months. After that, you've got all the benefit you can get, and so you have to move on to yoga, and then Tai Chi, and then bridge, always keeping on the steep part of the learning curve.","In 1989, SimCity introduced an entirely new brand of game play.","Everybody copied Atari products. So we started messing with them and it was fun. We bought enough chips that we could get them mislabeled. So we bankrupted at least two companies which copied our boards, and bought all the parts but they were the wrong parts, so they're sitting on all this inventory they can't sell because the games don't work.","How about keyboards in your mouth? How fast can you type with your tongue? People will think you're just masticating, when you're really talking to your girlfriend.","I don't feel 70. I am still looking out from 14-year-old eyes.","I was actually the manager of the games department of an amusement park when I was at college, so I understood the coin-op side of the games business very well.","I always loved both 'Breakout' and 'Asteroids' - I thought they were really good games. There was another game called 'Tempest' that I thought was really cool, and it represented a really hard technology. It's probably one of the only colour-vector screens that was used in the computer graphics field at that time.","Selling Atari when I did - I think that's my biggest regret. And I probably should have gotten back heavily into the games business in the late Eighties. But I was operating under this theory at the time that the way to have an interesting life was to reinvent yourself every five or six years.","'Pong' hit the fancy. It was sort of the perfect storm of a game which has two players highly social, a game that women could play better than a guy, and sort of an acceptance of this social nature of games in a bar.","I'm glad to see the casual game play coming back now on the Internet, games that aren't violent, that aren't complex that you can sit down and you can have some fun.","When it kind of went to 'Street Fighter', where you had to push 13 buttons with all 13 of your fingers and ripped the spine out of somebody, you know, violent games lost the women. Complexity lost the casual gamer.","In 1980, Atari was bringing in around two billion dollars in revenue and Chuck E. Cheese's some five hundred million. I still didn't feel too bad that I had turned down a one-third ownership of Apple - although I was beginning to think it might turn out to be a mistake.","My sweet spot is figuring out how to make a product that people love and how to refine it to make them love it more. All the rest is business noise.","I'd love to design a school.","Being your own boss is much superior to working for the man. Including working for your father.","The big problem that UWink had was we were essentially building tablets because they hadn't been invented yet. That drove up the cost a lot."],"Nolan Gerard Funk":["There are times where people ask for a lock of your hair, but the truth is I have a lot of gratitude for my fans.","I went to a dentist for a toothache, and it turned out his kids were in an acting school. We talked about it, and I decided to enroll at the same school. I was 14. I guess you could say I just got lucky.","If you're one of the Disney kids, it's like you have to talk about having a promise ring, you know?","I think I started toddler gymnastics when I was around 3 or 4, and I began taking it seriously when I was 6.","My goal has been to be a great character actor.","If people can see you in a film and not realize it's you until the very end, that's exciting to me.","My biggest fantasy as an actor is to be in situations that make me uncomfortable and force me out of my comfort zone.","I love the idea of renaissance. If my career is like painting a canvas, I want to have as many different colors in there as I can."],"Nolan Gould":["In this world, one thing you should definitely strive for is originality. Just be who you are, and be your own person. That's what will make you stand out.","My dad was in the military. It was difficult sometimes, because he would have to be away a lot, and we would have to move around a lot. Trying to adapt to new schools and new places can be really tough.","I don't believe that anyone can see the Grand Canyon area for themselves and not know that we have to do everything we can to protect it for future generations.","I know girls like musicians!","Acting isn't a sure thing. We're not set to have jobs for the rest of lives, and fame is really fickle.","I need something to fall back on if fame doesn't work. I'll have to become an economist or something.","I like reading, writing, hiking, camping, free running, surfing, rock climbing, long boarding, and so much more.","I started acting when I was, like, three. My brother was really smart, and he wasn't being challenged enough, so my mom put him in the theater class. And I obviously followed him.","I collect Hot Wheels. I collect glass. I collect coins. And I collect cards.","If you want to be an actor, you should keep confident. Don't get too much of an ego and become not humble. But you should have esteem and not feel bad when you don't book something. So I think you should just stay humble, but you also need to have some esteem to make yourself keep going.","I'm always kind of hoping that I'll get a movie that shoots in Alabama so I can go back and kind of get a break from my city life.","I'm on my computer a lot, but I swear I have an excuse! I spend about nine hours on media a day, but seven or eight of those are doing my schoolwork.","As for kids who are struggling personally, ignore the bullies! Who cares what they think? A lot of the time, they're not thinking, so you shouldn't take their words to heart. Ignore, ignore, ignore, and keep pushing forward.","I always put a lot of priority on my education, even if that means taking classes after work or on the weekends.","When I talk to other young people, I try to be as straightforward as possible. I'm a kid. I love getting outdoors. You should get outside, too!","I like to go hiking. I like to go rappelling, swimming, biking. I go boogie-boarding. I collect Hot Wheels. I collect glass. I collect coins. And I collect cards.","I do an improv show on Sunday where we have a class, and then afterwards we go and do a live performance in front of an audience.","My schedule is usually pretty busy, so when I wake up in the morning, first thing I usually do is turn on the TV and watch shows from the night before. I eat breakfast and watch TV and try to wake up.","During long car rides to the set, after I study my script, I go onto my iPad to read books and play games.","I'm pretty much using media all day because my school is online. It's sort of like homeschooling but also like going to real school - you log in and do all your work and email it to the teacher, and we have a teacher who oversees us on set.","Probably the thing I use most in media is video games, but I have to limit myself. If I wake up super early in the morning, and I'm not tired, I'll play video games until everybody gets up."],"Nolan North":["The really best acting is children in a playground or in a backyard. They're just lost in their imagination. The backyard isn't a pirate ship or a jungle, in the same way that the soundstage isn't Shambala.","I revel in my anonymity. But when I'm at a specific event and gamers are there, they'll recognise me.","I'm proud of the versatility I've had since I was in high school, getting in trouble for all these voices. What happened was that there were so many of these big heroes I played - in 'Dark Void,' 'Assassin's Creed,' 'Shadow Complex,' 'Uncharted,' and 'Prince of Persia' - and they all showed up at about the same time. It got a little ridiculous.","I studied journalism at The University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. I did my graduate work at Emerson in Boston, and I was actually a reporter for a year in New York and New Jersey. It dawned on me that I wasn't cut out for that line of work. I mean... there's a certain thing that really good reports have that I just didn't.","I eventually became an actor, starting with doing stand-up comedy in New York and then theater wherever they would let me. Finally, I moved out here to Los Angeles and got on a show.","There was a time when all the actors were saying, 'We should get residuals on videogames.' I just kept going, 'You don't have any idea what goes into making a game, do you?'","I know a lot of games have been going to the facial capture. And movies like 'TinTin' are using it, as well.","There's something known as the Uncanny Valley where things look a little too real and you're not quite sure what you're looking at. It becomes weird like it did in 'The Polar Express,' where the eyes seem so realistic, and yet you know it's animated.","Because Naughty Dog relies on their facial team to hand animate the faces of each game character and they do such a remarkable job, I think you can be more realistic with your acting. It gives the story and what's happening to you the feeling that it's a game.","I don't think 'Call Of Duty: Black Ops' sells 25 million plus copies and makes of a billion dollars because of their great storytelling. It's the multiplayer aspect of that type of game, where people get together to shoot each other and have fun. And it's very much gameplay; it's like 'Gran Turismo' or one of these racing games.","I am a person who believes in the good of people and who may have had things influence them to a certain degree, but deep down I think most people are good and would like to be good.","Harrison Ford has always been one of my favorite actors. I grew up with Han Solo and Indiana Jones, and 'Regarding Henry' is one of my favorite movies of all time.","In 'Uncharted,' we do the scenes the same way you would do a film or television show. The motion capture - the performance-capture process - is what makes such a difference for this franchise. So I don't approach it any differently. The other actors and I go in and rehearse scenes together, and then we go in the next day and perform.","When we did the first 'Uncharted,' we weren't able to capture the audio with the performances. We would go back and do A.D.R. - Automated Dialogue Replacement - in which you would hear yourself and then repeat your line. Even when we were doing that, there was a slight disconnect because you were trying to recreate a performance.","'Uncharted' is the best job I've ever had. Film, television, whatever - it's without doubt the best. It's changed my life.","The tailor from 'Avatar' actually made my suit for 'Uncharted 3.' And no, it's not a hand-me-down from Sam Worthington. My 11-year-old would fit in Sam Worthington's. I'm 6' 1\", 180 pounds.","One thing that's unique to 'Uncharted' is something called 'chasing picture,' where Naughty Dog run a section of gameplay and I'm allowed to ad-lib over it. We call it 'panning for gold.'","Of all the games I've done, the only time I've ever lost my voice was on 'Call Of Duty 2,' playing a rasping Russian captain on the Stalingrad level.","I'm an actor. Whether I'm on stage, in front of a camera or a microphone, what I do is the same - although with videogames it requires a lot of imagination.","I've always had a penchant for dialects. I remember getting detention and being told, 'Have a think about where doing these funny voices might get you someday.'","My first motion capture game was with Sony - 'NBA: The Life.' It was very ahead of its time. Brandon Akiaten, he was the writer and director. He had a real vision of what this game was meant to be; it was a basketball game where I was the Jerry Maguire sports agent type guy. And it was great!","I've found a lot of the thinking in America is that a lot of people become actors to become famous. At least from my experience, I have a dozen or so British friends who are actors, and if you look at their body of work, and they'll go do theatre, and they'll go do this and this. They work, and they're always honing and trying to be better.","I don't think there's room in video games for people to bring an ego. It's very frustrating for any actor to have someone who's a celebrity take over your place. Like the 'Uncharted' film, they're trying to find someone to play Nathan Drake. And it's like, why do they not think of us? We do this."],"Nolan Ryan":["One of the beautiful things about baseball is that every once in a while you come into a situation where you want to, and where you have to, reach down and prove something.","Enjoying success requires the ability to adapt. Only by being open to change will you have a true opportunity to get the most from your talent.","Everyone has limits. You just have to learn what your own limits are and deal with them accordingly.","It helps if the hitter thinks you're a little crazy.","It took me a while to figure that out and to realize what a gift that I had been given. And when I finally did, I dedicated myself to be the best pitcher I possibly could be, for as long as I possibly could be.","And I'm a believer that you take a negative and turn it into a positive, and as it turned out, it was one of the best things that ever happened to me. And so I do appreciate the Ranger staff and the Ranger organization for giving me that opportunity.","My job is to give my team a chance to win.","And when I retired, trust me, not only did Nolan Ryan, but the entire Ryan family had withdrawals from baseball. And it was tough.","And when I went to Houston, they had a conditioning coach by the name of Gene Coleman. And that was the first time I had gone to an organization that had a program with a weight room and designed specifically for pitchers.","I always thought that there was going to be life after baseball, and so I designed that in my life I would have other interests after baseball that I would be able to step into. And I didn't realize the grip that baseball had on me and on my family.","I feel very fortunate that I played for the four organizations I did.","And that's what makes this a great game, is the support and the commitment that the fans give the game.","And then when I went to stay in '68, I can honestly say that I was not focused on my career and on what it took to be a major league pitcher and to be a starting pitcher.","And to play as long as I did and to have a family you have to be very blessed and I was with my wife Ruth. Ruth, I appreciate the job you did, and my three fine children, Reid, Reese, and Wendy.","Baseball life is a tough life on the family.","Dick Moss, my agent. Dick became my agent in 1979 when I signed my contract with the Houston Astros.","For my children, they spent 15 to 20 years of their life in baseball. And Ruth and I spent so many years of our married life that that was our life. We knew nothing else.","I am going to spend my time today just thanking the people that played a role in my career, because I truly do believe that I was blessed by a lot of people that paths crossed mine as I went down the road in my career.","I came into the game when I broke into the major leagues, the minimum salary was seven thousand dollars, and I'd have to go home in the wintertime and get a job.","I can honestly say it took two full years for me to get over the fact that I was no longer a baseball player.","I had the pleasure, as Robin said, to live a childhood dream as many young Americans and Puerto Rican children live that play youth baseball. And I feel honored and very thankful for that opportunity.","I like to refer to my years with the Angels as the foundation of my career.","When I got traded to the California Angels, I really wasn't that excited about going to the Angels because it meant changing leagues and also a whole new set of teammates. But shortly after I got there I realized that it was one of the best things that ever happened to me.","What man in his 40s would not like to look in the mirror and find Nolan Ryan?"],"Nolan Sotillo":["Singing was probably my first love, and song writing. I write a lot of love songs and heartbreaking songs.","There's something very powerful about going after what you want seriously.","When I was a lot younger, I did some work with St. Jude's, but then we went on a 'Red Band' tour across the United States, and we went to a bunch of hospitals and had the privilege of meeting kids who are suffering or going through these different situations.","'Red Band Society' is inspiring, funny, and an uplifting story that makes you want to make the most of your life, love and live to the fullest, and that's a great message.","I met Victoria Justice once. She was so nice. I've always been a fan.","I watch a lot of Disney. I want to catch 'Hannah Montana Forever.'","Going into hospitals and being able to meet kids that are in similar situations to those that the characters are facing in the 'Red Band Society' allows us to see the truth of these real humans' lives.","Music is definitely something that I'd like to pursue. It's probably, I mean, the acting and music are the two biggest things in my life.","I'm going to continue posting on my YouTube, which is youtube.com/nolansotillo. So I mean, if I get signed and come out with an album, it would be just another... that is a goal of mine.","It kind of pays off to try your best at every audition; you never know what can happen. You can get a hundred nos, but if you just get one yes, it can change your life.","I play guitar, piano, and I'm learning to play the drums.","I always liked performing in front of my parents' friends. My dad bought me a karaoke machine, and I would put on a Michael Jackson song like 'Thriller,' and I would come out with, like, a hat and a jacket, and, like, moonwalk in my socks, so I was always performing.","'The Who' created the Daltrey/Townshend Center at UCLA for teenage hospital patients with cancer. It's the only one of its kind.","You should be watching 'Red Band Society' because it's a show that inspires us to live. I feel like you'll get connected to these characters, and they teach you something that you can apply to your daily life."],"Noma Dumezweni":["I am so lucky I get to work with amazing, amazing people.","I remember, being young is a scary, wonderful feeling.","To acknowledge the beginnings of people is a beautiful thing.","If I think even a week ahead, I get terrified. My big thing is trying to enjoy the moment as much as I can.","I wasn't very academic at school, but the Wolsey Youth Theatre was the saving of me.","I tried twice to get into drama school and didn't, so I worked my way up through the fringe.","I moved to London, and it's a cliche to say that London is a melting pot, but it's true - I didn't stand out anymore.","I arrived in this country as a refugee child with my sister and my mother.","Family - it's all about family. Families feeling safe and finding your safe place.","The only question we should ask is, 'Are they good?' I've met great actors, black and white, and I've met bad actors, black and white.","At the very beginning, being a parent did impact how I go about this business.","The world shows us what we need at a specific moment in time.","I am very blessed to have this experience of being a parent, but do not negate me from this industry because I am a parent.","I am a black woman who has been given this character called Hermione to play on the stage. But actually, we've all grown up with the books, with Emma Watson playing her in the films. Imagery is so strong.","I'm a great company actor, a great supporting actor. I serve the piece.","I now realise I'm a great actor.","I don't do the victim mode. I don't do blame. I can't bear that.","There are so many directors, young and old, around - all doing their thing and struggling.","We're storytellers - and if the story is told well, you go with the form.","I'm working with theatre-makers who are the top of their game, and it's extraordinary.","I've always been curious about the other worlds we can shift into in our imaginations.","Stop worrying what other people think.","The weight of expectation is huge. But for me, that pressure has been outweighed by getting text messages from mums I know saying how huge it is for their mixed-race daughters that I am playing Hermione.","However popular you are, you still feel like an outsider.","I am so passionate about representation because, growing up, I didn't see myself, and now people can say, 'I see myself there.' We're all trying to find where we are.","Whoever we are, we have to carve something out of our lives. I would like to be on my deathbed going, 'I've enjoyed that. I went through the rollercoaster of it, but I've appreciated it.'","In your 20s and 30s, everything is possible. But then, sooner than you think, men walk past you in the street and don't look twice at you unless you're wearing a fabulous outfit.","My mum's a single mum, I'm a single mum, and you do find yourself rushing around just to make sure everything's all right.","It's hard; this business of acting is hard.","I did fringe theatre for so many years, and then I got my first play at the RSC, which was an amazing feeling, but I was 30 and had started acting in my early twenties.","I have been that actor who's watched peers and thought, 'God, they're doing well. I'll never get there.'","For me, you could say my big West End debut was 'Cursed Child,' but I'm in my 40s, and it's like, 'When is that beginning?'"],"Nomar Garciaparra":["You know it as soon as you walk in Yankee Stadium. The electricity is there every time, every day.","People expect you to play your best, so I go through a routine to prepare myself so that I know I'm physically and mentally ready - prepared for the game.","Back then, my idol was Bugs Bunny, because I saw a cartoon of him playing ball - you know, the one where he plays every position himself with nobody else on the field but him? Now that I think of it, Bugs is still my idol. You have to love a ballplayer like that.","That's basically what I'm doing when I'm tapping them - getting my toes to the end of my shoes.","I love the game of baseball.","My inspiration was the game itself, not any individual player in it.","When I go home my mother still makes me take out the garbage.","People ask me if my shoes were too small when I was a kid and I say it wouldn't matter how fight my shoes were, I just liked that feeling of them being in there. That's how I started tapping my toes.","People are going to make comparisons and they can do that but I'm definitely not going to compare myself to Derek Jeter.","It's great that fans have people they can enjoy and watch play."],"Nong Duc Manh":["All countries, big or small, strong or weak, are equal members of the United Nations.","In Vietnam we have no political prisoners. No one is arrested or jailed for his or her speech or point of view. They are put in jail because they violated the law.","The war against terrorism should not be used to interfere with an independent, sovereign state. We need to identify concrete terrorist targets and do no harm to civilians.","We cannot but feel uneasy about the losses caused by humanity themselves. Apart from the losses of life and property in destructive wars, the environment and natural resources are also being destroyed by human hands.","We don't want to keep secrets anymore.","As part of our renewal - we need to fight problems, not just wait for them to take place.","In general, everyone wants to work and work more. But in fact, when a young generation has sufficient capability then we should create conditions for them to work.","I think everything should be governed by law. We don't want to keep secrets anymore.","What is in the Constitution is the burning desire and aspiration of all the people of Vietnam. So for the moment, we don't think about opposition parties.","Individual rights always go along with the interests of the society. I want to add that in Vietnam we have no political prisoners.

If it's a right I'll take it.","If there's a best, I want to fight them.","As a boxer, you have to put risk in to get to another level.","With me, boxing's a beautiful sport.","Growing up as an amateur, I wasn't much of a power puncher. I was more of a speed guy.","A lot of guys just punch with their arms; they don't utilize every part of their muscles they can use. I know how to use that, and that's where the power comes in.","As long as I have that support from my team, and I have that confidence in myself that I train really hard, I think there's no one out there who can defeat me in my weight class.","Usually, sprinting is my main source of energy and recovery time because that's how I move.","I was always scared in the amateurs, but the minute I got in the ring it was like another person took over. I become more vicious. In there I love to hurt people. Outside I can't hurt a bug.","People call me a nerd because I like to spend time on the computer.","My Internet friends who I play games with say, 'This guy's a fighter?' I'm the last person they expect to be a fighter.","The best feeling is to win by knockout.","I'm not into being competitive.

He's really down to earth, and we got to know each other quite well.","As soon as I started acting in England, I got unusual roles. Although I'm 6 foot six, and agents might standardly cast me in tough guy roles or the big guy in the back, I've been very blessed to do roles that makes them think twice about how they're gonna cast me.","I want to do primarily film and theater; I always want to do a play because it feeds my soul. It's like an exercise on stage.","I wouldn't say I'm moving to America; I certainly would say that I'm just staying there; and I certainly wouldn't advise anyone to come here unless they've got an extensive CV in the U.K.; you have to build your career wherever you started from."],"Noomi Rapace":["I've always been very stubborn, had a very clear will of what I want to do.","When I don't understand things, I become passionate to understand.","I think Stieg Larsson was pretty brave.

The cracks.","When I was a teenager, I was like, 'Something is wrong with me. I don't fit in. I'm not like everybody else.' So, I always knew that I wanted to explore and move on, but it was completely unexpected, the way it happened.","If I don't see myself as a victim, then I'm not a victim.","I always felt like I was on the move, that I was going towards something.","So I kind of lost track for a while, then I came back, I pulled myself together and I decided when I was 15 that I'm going to get sober and I'm going to become an actress.","We need more extreme movies in Sweden. Personal projects that are necessarily made for a bigger audience. I think it creates a creative lock-up to have the audience as a goal.","I want to explore more sides of humanity and myself. That's what acting is about.","In Sweden everybody has this perfect surface. Everyone's very polite and controls their feelings.","I like doing fight scenes. I always have, and I insist on doing as much of that action as they'll let me do. I think that's easy for me.","I don't have this crazy dream about going to Hollywood, because I really love to watch movies and do movies that are complicated, and I want more strange things and complicated things.","It's better to not be afraid of things and not avoid things.","I'm terrified of being too famous. What I'm really afraid of is that the audiences will go into the theater and not be able to forget that it's me, that fame will stand in the way of my acting.

Black, it's the anti-magical thing. It comes from the recognition that it is not going to be 'the' dress.","I am continually fascinated at the difficulty intelligent people have in distinguishing what is controversial from what is merely offensive.","Insane people are always sure that they are fine. It is only the sane people who are willing to admit that they are crazy.","The best divorce is the kind where there are no children. That was my first divorce.

But dinners with couples seated next to one another are always deadly dull, which is why there are almost no good dinner parties in the entire state of California.","Everybody dies. There's no avoiding it, and I do not believe for one second that butter is the cause of anyone's death. Overeating may be, but not butter, please. I just feel bad for people who make that mistake.","I don't think any day is worth living without thinking about what you're going to eat next at all times.","I am the kind of person who really will drive hours for a bowl of chili. I'm not a three-star restaurant kind of a person; I'm just a food person.","Death is a sniper. It strikes people you love, people you like, people you know - it's everywhere. You could be next.

I work when there is something due or when I am really excited about a piece.","If pregnancy were a book they would cut the last two chapters.","I have been forgetting things for years - at least since I was in my 30s. I know this because I wrote something about it at the time; I have proof. Of course I can't remember exactly where I wrote about it or when, but I could probably hunt it up if I had to.","I don't think there was ever a dish that changed my life. I certainly remember a constant series of things that I had for the first time and thought, 'Where has this been all my life?' One was brie. I mean, oh my God! One was my first soft-shell crabs.","My mother was a good recreational cook, but what she basically believed about cooking was that if you worked hard and prospered, someone else would do it for you.","In my sex fantasy, nobody ever loves me for my mind.","Beware of men who cry. It's true that men who cry are sensitive to and in touch with feelings, but the only feelings they tend to be sensitive to and in touch with are their own.","As far as the men who are running for president are concerned, they aren't even people I would date.","The realization that I may have only a few good years remaining has hit me with real force, and I have done a lot of thinking as a result. I would like to have come up with something profound, but I haven't.","One of the best things about directing movies, as opposed to merely writing them, is that there's no confusion about who's to blame: you are.","I have always thought it was a terrible shame that the women's movement didn't realise how much easier it was to reach people by making them laugh than by shaking a fist and saying, 'Don't you see how oppressed you are?'","I use those medical gloves that fit very tightly and are disposable for all chopping - peppers, onions, garlic, etc. Very Lady Macbeth, I think.","One good thing I'd like to say about divorce is that it sometimes makes it possible for you to be a much better wife to your next husband because you have a place for your anger - it's not directed at the person you're currently with.","My second divorce was the worst kind of divorce. There were two children; one had just been born. My husband was in love with someone else.","Everything matches black, especially black.","Your hair doesn't need to be washed every day any more than your black pants have to be dry-cleaned every time you wear them.","Summer bachelors, like summer breezes, are never as cool as they pretend to be.","Whenever I get married, I start buying Gourmet magazine.","What my mother believed about cooking is that if you worked hard and prospered, someone else would do it for you.","The desire to get married, which - I regret to say, I believe is basic and primal in women - is followed almost immediately by an equally basic and primal urge - which is to be single again.","I try to write parts for women that are as complicated and interesting as women actually are.","What will happen to sex after liberation? Frankly, I don't know. It is a great mystery to all of us.","With any child entering adolescence, one hunts for signs of health, is desperate for the smallest indication that the child's problems will never be important enough for a television movie.","When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.","Denial has been a way of life for me for many years. I actually believe in denial.","Writing is what I do. It's like breathing to me at a certain point, but if I couldn't write, I do like cooking.","Directing movies is the best job there is, that's all. I can hardly say a word after that.

And when e-mail came along, I was just going to fall in love with it. And I did. I can't believe it now - it's like one of those ex-husbands that you think, 'What was I thinking?'","We're saved somewhat by Google. You can - when you're all sitting around the table desperately snapping your fingers in the hopes of remembering the name of that movie that you can't remember the name of - you can make people think that you are not as old as you actually are because you have the technology to find the answer.","E-mail is a whole new way of being friends with people: intimate but not, chatty but not, communicative but not; in short, friends but not. What a breakthrough. How did we ever live without it? I have more to say on this subject, but I have to answer an instant message from someone I almost know.","I'm a good cook, and I look at something like 'Iron Chef' and think, 'It's a good thing I already know how to cook' - because I would never think I could do it if I watched these shows.","Washington is a city of important men and the women they married before they grew up.","Nothing like mashed potatoes when you're feeling blue. Nothing like getting into bed with a bowl of hot mashed potatoes already loaded with butter, and methodically adding a thin, cold slice of butter to every forkful.","I'm religious about salted butter. I don't understand how it happened that everyone thought we should all have sweet butter. I blame the French.","I grew up with fantastic Southern food. In Southern California.","The one thing my mother did make was what was known at the time as lox and onions and eggs. Now, no one makes it with lox; they make it with nova. That was my mother's specialty, which she cooked on New Year's Day for the Rose Bowl games, which we had a party for every year. It took her about an hour to make scrambled eggs.","I buy a lot of cookbooks. Some of them you just kind of read, and you try one recipe, and it doesn't really work. So then you don't go back to it. The new Ina Garten cookbook, which is called 'Back to Basics,' I have not had a failure with. It is the most fantastic cookbook. I think I bought 20 copies of it for friends.","I was alive during the women's lib movement, and I do not remember anyone taking a position against cooking. I think they were talking about other things.","The truth is that most marriages have food as a major player in them, and certainly mine does.","Food was supposed to be a slightly bigger part of 'Heartburn,' and it actually didn't turn out to be because of me. I just didn't find a way to make it a bigger part of the movie as I should have, and we cut several scenes in which food was a major character.","If only I had grown up worshipping Julia Child. I was already grown up - thank you very much - when Julia Child's book was published. When I moved to New York in 1962, you had to own it.","All I do when I write scripts is think about food: 'Have I worked long enough to justify a walk to the kitchen?'","I feel really bad for people who aren't insane over food.","When we were working on 'Julie & Julia,' I went back to the Julia Child cookbook and made some things I haven't made in a while, one being beef bourguignon, which to me is a hilariously 1960s dish that everyone felt they had to serve at a dinner party or they weren't a grown-up.","I don't have writer's block, really. I do have times when I can't get the lead, and that is the only part of the story which I have serious trouble with. I don't write a word of the article until I have the lead. It just sets the whole tone - the whole point of view.","I think that readers believe that a writer becomes friends with the people he interviews and writes about - and I think there are some writers who do that - but that hasn't happened to me. I do think it's dangerous because then you write the article to please them, which is a terrible error.","I survived turning 60, I was not thrilled to turn 61, I was less thrilled to turn 62, I didn't much like being 63, I loathed being 64, and I will hate being 65. I don't let on about such things in person; in person, I am cheerful and Pollyanna-ish. But the honest truth is that it's sad to be over 60.","Here are some questions I am constantly fretting over: Do you splurge, or do you hoard? Do you live every day as if it's your last, or do you save your money on the chance you'll live 20 more years? Is life too short, or is it going to be too long?","I have now been married to my third husband for more than 20 years. But when you've had children with someone you're divorced from, divorce defines everything; it's the lurking fact, a slice of anger in the pie of your brain.","I just bring a black turtleneck sweater everywhere - it's the greatest purchase of my life. Period.","The neck starts to go at 43, and that's that."],"Nora Roberts":["In the summer of '80, Silhouette bought my first book.","Love and magic have a great deal in common. They enrich the soul, delight the heart. And they both take practice.","I decided to write category romance as I'd recently discovered them, and enjoyed them.","The most important aspect of any story, to me, is character.","Action, reaction, motivation, emotion, all have to come from the characters. Writing a love scene requires the same elements from the writer as any other.","I'd always loved to read - and come from a family of readers - but I never thought about writing as a career.","I loved the process of writing.","For over a year I continued to submit mss, and have them rejected - the last few with rejection letters indicated the story was pretty good, but I was American.","I long for typical days, but rarely get them any more.","I find I use the Internet more and more. It's just an invaluable tool. I do most of my research on the Net now - and certainly do the bulk of my communicating through email.","I've gotten to know a number of readers from being online, and really treasure the time I've spent with them.","I don't think you can write - at least not well - if you don't love stories, love the written word.","One of my greatest pleasures is falling into a story someone else has written.","I read a lot - and I read a variety of genres.","Mary Stewart will always be my goddess. I can pick up one of her early books - one I've read a dozen times - and still slide right into the story.","If you write in category, you write knowing there's a framework, there are reader expectations.","I don't believe for one moment you can write well what you wouldn't read for pleasure.","I believe strongly in writing groups such as Romance Writers Of America that offer support, information and networking.","Every writer has to figure out what works best - and often has to select and discard different tools before they find the one that fits.","You don't find time to write. You make time. It's my job.","I do indeed write on the road. My laptop goes with me everywhere.","Every single book is a challenge.","And each book has to receive your best effort every single time. No slacking.","Certainly the plagiarism, and dealing with the fallout of it, was the most difficult thing I've ever faced since I started writing.","I need to write to be happy.","Aren't most romance heros, or heros in fiction of any kind, generally superior to real men? Same goes for heroines and real women.","My own sense of family, where I came from and what I made for myself is an important part of my life.","I generally write a first draft that's pretty lean. Just get the story down.","I don't fiddle or edit or change while I'm going through that first draft.","I would hope that my writing's cleaner than it was when I started.","I don't base any character on a real person, and really don't do composites either. I make them up.","Actually, I find it great fun to develop family series with lots of characters."],"Norah Jones":["During my first photo shoot, I was unhappy because they put so much makeup on me and straightened my hair. I've been stubborn ever since.","I really love things with melody.","I just want to keep making music, recording and trying different things. I don't want to do the same thing all the time.","It's fun to peek into other people's worlds and see how they go about doing things.","A lot of pop people out there are cool, but they overdo it.","I think it's important for people who love music to retain physical CDs or even vinyl, because it sounds so great and so much warmer than music over the internet.","I became a musician so I wouldn't have to get up at 6 in the morning.","I don't want to be singing my diary.","I'm not planning to jump off a bridge with no bungee.","A record is just a snapshot of where you are at any time.","I don't try to sound like anyone but me anymore. If something is out of my element, I try to avoid it.","God bless Ray Charles. It was such an honor to meet him and sing with him and actually just to watch him sing from just two feet away.","The coolest thing I've gotten to do in the past few years is guest star on Sesame Street.","Songs are about whatever you want them to be about. For me it might mean something completely different than what it means to you. So I'd say it's about whatever the listener thinks it's about.","A song will keep going round in my brain and keep me awake.","Nobody was listening when I learned how to play music. But there's something about being on stage, talking to the audience, looking at them and smiling, that's always been difficult for me. I'm a lot more comfortable now, but there are still moments of awkwardness.","All is fair in love and songwriting.","What I was going for in the first two albums I didn't necessarily achieve. Because I was young and because it was my first time out. And the second album was such a 'quickie' sort of 'Let's just get it over with!' But the kind of music I make, there's a lot of subtlety in it. And I think it takes a couple of listens to actually really get it.","When I moved to New York, I fell head over heels back into country music and probably 'cause I missed something about Texas.","I wasn't very aware of pop music because I attended an arts school. For me, it was all about jazz.","I don't think I'm a great songwriter, but I think I've learned a lot about it, and I don't think there's any one way to do it. I don't think I can control it at all. I can just kind of hope that it happens.","People will read into what you say no matter what, so it doesn't matter to me.","I didn't think it was fair to my music to label me as the daughter of somebody - I didn't think it described me very well and I didn't think it had anything to do with my music.","I'm ballsy. Well, sometimes I'm ballsy.","Anyone can look pretty with hair and make-up.","I feel like all the songs are little scenes, different angles, of the feelings that come around something ending.","I wasn't a trained Mickey Mouse club performer. I played in jazz clubs and restaurants.","In college I had a weekend gig at a restaurant, a solo thing that was the best practice I could have ever had. That's where I learned to coordinate my singing and my piano playing.","Without a piano I don't know how to stand, don't know what to do with my hands.","I got stood up by the letter Y, he was hanging around with his X.","I've always loved to read. But sometimes I go for a year without reading, because I forget to.","I don't want to be the next big anything. I just want to play for people and that's it.","The pop world is cool, but I never really thought of myself as part of it or wanting to be a part of it because I'm on a label that's not really like that. They're not trying to dress me up, they're not trying to do things like that. I feel like I'm sort of separate from that, actually.","You would never catch me in a miniskirt.","Designers send me clothes I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing.","I'm not trying to conquer Hollywood. I love my day job.","Coffee gives me bad breath.","I like to be in control of things.","For me, there's a fine line between being a cheeseball and being a good performer.","There's a lot of personal stuff that can go into songwriting but there's also a lot of dramatization and fictionalization. You have to do that to make a good song.","I make a good fried chicken.","I like barbecuing because it's easy.","You know, when you have a father who's pretty well known but you don't see him, the last thing you want to do is start talking about him all the time to people.","I'd done recordings, little demos, since I was in college, which I used to get gigs. But I never thought I'd have a record label.","Everyone in my high school was a bit nerdy. We didn't even have a football team.","I love film, and I would love to be a part of something that people universally love as a piece of film. Sure. Of course I would. And I would love to take acting lessons, and see that side of it someday. But I'm a musician.","If you're a female and you get asked by someone who shoots the most beautiful female scenes to be in their film, it's kind of exciting.","I feel like I've been lucky, because I don't feel like I've ever tried to be somebody I'm not. People might disagree.","When something's ending, you go through so many phases, and it can be frustrating. But once you're out on the other side, it's like you can really see all the crazy phases you went through.","I'm not going to play lead guitar in a concert hall full of people, because I'm going to mess up a lot.","Your limitations create your sound.","A lot of my music is slow and subtle. The subtly is what I enjoy about making music.","My first two records are so simply constructed. The reason isn't because I wanted to make simple music. It's because I don't really have the chops.","I'm a musician because I love it and it's supposed to be fun.","It's true, there's a lot of melancholy in my music. I don't know why, I'm not a melancholy person. I've always been drawn to it. Ever since I was a kid, if I had an album I would play the ballads on repeat.","I like songs with a lot of heart and feeling and subtlety.","For me making music is part social, part interaction, part collaboration.","I've been told the weirdest things: 'Yeah, I love taking a bath to your music!' or 'I gave birth to my daughter while listening to your music.'","Success and the art of making music are two different things for me.","I'm always going to do that - record and make music.","On the first album I was saying, that's just one part of me. And then I was thinking, well, am I going to hide the rest of me now just because I'm afraid of something? No. I'm just going to be myself.","I love slow music.","I'm not a very dark person.","I used to be a jazz snob, believe it or not. I sort of turned my nose up at anything more commercial.","Breaking up is just hard, even if you're the one breaking up. It's not fun. It can be dramatic and complicated. And then you get a little distance and you think, why did it have to be so complicated and dramatic?","I don't think it's a bad thing to share how you feel, especially if people can relate to it.","Nobody can tell you you're wrong for writing a song about how you feel - even if you don't really feel that way.","I always try to do something different. I don't think I've made the same record over and over.","I would love to make a real jazz album someday because I never have. But that's something I'm not in a rush to do.","Making records is fun. It's not some big statement. You're allowed to make mistakes.","There are absolutely no problems between me, my dad and my sister. Obviously I grew up with just my mum, but my relationship with my dad is just fine.","There was an enormous amount of pressure when my first album took off, and I struggled with the speed of everything and the exhaustion from the constant touring.","I genuinely don't feel that anything that's been written or said about me has overshadowed my music, and that's the most important thing as far as I'm concerned.","I don't like shopping, and I like my clothes to be comfortable.","Sometimes when you're trying to do a record too close to home, you can get really distracted.","I could do without 'cool' publications calling me 'mom jazz.' But I laughed all the way to the bank, baby.","Maybe I'm genetically more inclined to music - but the music I make is so far removed from Indian classical music. I grew up in Texas!","I love my dad and we have a very good relationship now.","I love eggs so much. I feel like my day hasn't started until I've had eggs. I'm probably gonna die from high cholesterol!","My mom and I have always been very close. She is my best friend. She had to make a lot of sacrifices early on in my life to make sure I got to do what I wanted to do.","I just want to make my music, and I want it to stand on its own.","I'm not a great piano player.","I like my life. I like my friends. I don't want to go anywhere else.","I should have a therapist. I have plenty to therapise about.","I like records that flow really well and you don't have to skip around because there's lot of different jumps.","I hope there are some audiophiles still out there.","For a young artist to really make it and make money is a lot more difficult these days.","I had very modest expectations when I first moved to New York. I didn't even expect to get a record deal.","I think singing comes most naturally for me. Because it's part of your body - it's a natural thing. You can practice all you want but it's part of your body.","Songwriting is something I really need to work on. I don't have very many songs but I really love it. I would love to be a great song writer some day.","I don't actually have a lot of discipline. I've worked hard at music. But I feel like you know, I felt like kind of natural at it. I always had a knack for it.","I'm very American.","I actually write more on guitar than I do on piano.","I try to just make music that I love, and if I believe in it that's all that matters."],"Norah O'Donnell":["Persistence is incredibly important. Persistence proves to the person you're trying to reach that you're passionate about something, that you really want something.","I really enjoy making sure the kids get a healthy dinner, a good bath and several books... I really like to try and end the day with some quality time with my kids. If not, I feel guilty.","I have always said 'yes' to opportunities and experiences.","One of the most common mistakes for an entry-level job interview is to take the position: 'What is this job going to do for me?' You should be saying 'Here's what I can do and here's what I want to do to help you.'","You face challenges in your personal life and in your professional life. I continue to be relentlessly optimistic and not focus on the negative.","I grew up in San Antonio, Texas, and went to a big high school called Douglas McArthur where there was a lot of track and a lot of football. It was a bit like 'Friday Night Lights.' I used to spend a lot of time at the track.","I started running track when I was 13 years old, as a freshman in high school. I ran the 400 meters, which is a very tough race and a full sprint.","As a working mom, I struggle to find time to work out and go for runs. I usually run two to three times a week and work out with a trainer once a week. I try to go for a longer run on Sundays.","Growing up, my parents were healthy eaters and starting to run and compete when I was 13, I knew the need to focus on what you need to eat. I remember going to grocery store myself and picking up fresh fruit and knowing early on the right foods to fuel my body.","I don't love the phrase 'balancing work and family.' It sets up this idea of scales of justice with work on one side and family on the other side."],"Norbert Leo Butz":["I survived in high school by working at Kentucky Fried Chicken and made my way up to assistant manager. I was surviving high school and college with that job.","I always loved soul music. My dad was a very religious guy, and we would listen to a lot of gospel and soul music. My college girlfriend introduced me to musicals. She listened to them, so that was the first time I heard 'Dream Girls.'","Something about being surrounded by water has a really calming effect on me.","If you individualize an audience, it helps up the stakes of your responsibility to that audience.","I make decisions quickly.","I hate sitting around a table and talking about what a play might mean. I'm the person who's always like, 'Can we get up on our feet and just do it?'","If you are opening a play, a play that's really about something, a play that's really about ideas, you have to find a way to sell that play.","It's thrilling to be onstage and to not know, literally, what the next moment is going to bring. To just submit to the not-knowing-ness of it.","I was in the original cast of 'Wicked', and that got a bad review in 'The New York Times,' and it's the most successful thing that's ever been put onstage.","I don't know if Jesus said it in the Bible, but someone said that 'the love of money is the root of all evil,' and I do think there's a correlation between the ambition that a lot of people have, in terms of financial remuneration, and the loss of core values.","I have 10 brothers and sisters.","I got my Actors' Equity card officially by playing Nana the dog in 'Peter Pan' at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival. That was the first show I did as a full-fledged, dues-paying member; I earned points in my MFA program, then went into the company after I graduated.","I have an acting crush on Gene Hackman; I have an acting crush on Tommy Lee Jones. Gary Cooper. Jimmy Cagney. Michael Gambon. Simon Russell Beale.","I love it when people take contemporary songs and find a narrative or a theatrical way of telling it.","Sometimes, you don't know what's going to happen to your character until the night before you shoot the scene. So, sometimes, you get a great big surprise at the very last minute, which is scary sometimes. You don't have a whole lot of time to prepare.","I've sort of left the theater just for little shoots here and there - little one-off series or small roles in films or whatever.","I used to do a lot of repertory theater. You're playing different roles all the time, and I love that.","I've never seen 'Mad Men.' I've never seen 'Breaking Bad.' I've never seen 'The Sophranos.' These sort of seminal shows.","I actually have seven brothers in real life, and we're all very close in age. We basically go no more than two years between any of us.","Sam Shepard is - I didn't tell this to Sammy, but if I had to point to one artist that made me want to do this for my life, it's Sam Shepard.","Most of my work in New York has been on new musicals. And all through the preview process, they throw you new songs, new lyrics, new choreography, new scripts; you're constantly getting new material. You might get it in the morning and put it in the show at night. It happens every single day, so those muscles are pretty toned.","I've been swimming recreationally about five times a week for years just at the Y.","I've always been drawn more to film. But 'Bloodline,' to me, feels like a 13-hour piece of cinema. And the great thing about Netflix is you get to be almost like an editor. You choose how much of the narrative you want to watch at a time, which makes you complicit in the story.","I'm a pretty avid reader, but I missed feminism in college. I did take an intro course where I read Mary Wollstonecraft, but I didn't read a lot of the seminal writers. Then I had two teenage daughters and was reading books on development and different issues.","I remember really getting into 'The Wiz' and an old musical called 'Purlie,' which Melba Moore sang. I liked those roof-raising shows because I connected deeply with the gospel aspects of those musicals.","I have never been too concerned about things you're supposed to be concerned about as a singer. Pitch is important, and so is sounding good. But I think there's something underneath all that.","I am the most successful unsuccessful actor in New York. And I guess with that, maybe apparent only to myself, there started to be a very subtle but unmistakable whiff of entitlement, bitterness, jealousy. I was not respecting the work."],"Norbert Wiener":["To live effectively is to live with adequate information.","The idea that information can be stored in a changing world without an overwhelming depreciation of its value is false. It is scarcely less false than the more plausible claim that after a war we may take our existing weapons, fill their barrels with information.","The nervous system and the automatic machine are fundamentally alike in that they are devices, which make decisions on the basis of decisions they made in the past.","Progress imposes not only new possibilities for the future but new restrictions.","The more we get out of the world the less we leave, and in the long run we shall have to pay our debts at a time that may be very inconvenient for our own survival.","What most experimenters take for granted before they begin their experiments is infinitely more interesting than any results to which their experiments lead."],"Noreena Hertz":["I try to take a weekly digital Sabbath, batch my emails so I deal with them a few times a day rather than constantly, and increasingly give myself permission to ignore unsolicited communiques. I try, too, to give others more slack. The respond-now culture is a two-way street. I'm trying to be more mindful of that.","Governments have been ceding power to big multinational corporations in the market. We see the manifest in a variety of ways. Where governments are giving up power to big international institutions like the World Trade Organization or NAFTA, which are disabling governments' ability to protect the rights of their own people.","Get into the habit of imagining an alternate scenario. By posing such 'imagine if' questions... we can distance ourselves from the frames, cues, anchors and rhetoric that might be affecting us.","All company bosses want a policy on corporate social responsibility. The positive effect is hard to quantify, but the negative consequences of a disaster are enormous.","If power lies more and more in the hands of corporations rather than governments, the most effective way to be political is not to cast one's vote at the ballot box, but to do so at the supermarket or at a shareholders' meeting. When provoked, corporations respond.","Errors in decision-making lead young people to under-save for retirement, doctors to miss tumours, CEOs to make catastrophic investments, governments to engage in needless wars, and parents to irreversibly traumatize their children.","The global policy shift toward neo-liberalism that took place during the 1980s and 1990s was supposed, according to its proponents, to bring a convergence of living standards of richer and poorer nations. This never actually happened.","The problem lies with us: we've become addicted to experts. We've become addicted to their certainty, their assuredness, their definitiveness, and in the process, we have ceded our responsibility, substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom.","All of us show bias when it comes to what information we take in. We typically focus on anything that agrees with the outcome we want.","Transparency, accountability and sustainability have become the slogans of the market leaders. Companies carry out environmental and social audits to court the consumer, and even the bluest chips woo organisations such as Greenpeace and Amnesty.","Child labour may be distasteful to westerners, but does boycotting goods made with child labour improve or exacerbate the lot of third world children? Trusting the market to regulate may not ultimately be in our interest.","Managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement, discord and difference.","From solar to electric cars, from geothermal to reconfiguring the grid, the scale of investment needed in green technologies in order to meet whatever agreements on emissions reductions are finally agreed will be immense.","Goodwill and reputation are intangibles, but they are the keys to business success. Since they are also inexorably linked to social values, it follows that a change in social norms will have a significant impact on profits.","I have problems with this very extreme form of capitalism where the pendulum has swung so far in one direction, where the focus is completely on the short term, and no one is thinking about the consequences.","Forcing companies to recruit away from the golf course might lead to the appointment of more women from NGOs and academia and medicine, all of whom are likely to understand such concepts as stewardship and sustainability much better than men picked from the usual hunting grounds.","We live increasingly in a world of haves and have-nots, of gated communities next to ghettos, of extreme poverty and unbelievable riches. Some enjoy rights that are completely denied to others. Relative inequalities are exploding, and the world's poorest, despite all the advances of globalisation, may even be getting poorer.","What my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps; that within these camps, a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition; that experts move with the prevailing winds, often hero-worshipping their own gurus.","I'm really looking at questions of power, navigation, and spin. Then I am also looking for real-world stories that give me greater insight into smart and new ways of thinking.","As an economist specializing in the global economy, international trade and debt, I have spent most of my career helping others make big decisions - prime ministers, presidents and chief executives - and so I'm all too aware of the risks and dangers of poor choices in the public as well as the private sphere.","I was really interested to see whether we could make predictions or forecasts by listening in on what people were saying on social media.","So key for making smart decisions is a mindset that actively monitors and is open to shifting tides and new information, one that is acutely aware that the interplay between our environment and its outcomes is ever in flux.","We are beginning to see a fundamental outrage at the whole interconnected mess of a system: at energy companies who record massive profits, yet allow pensioners to struggle to stay warm in winter; at CEOs who can earn up to a 1,000 times the salary of their average worker; and soon, any day now, at those politicians who allowed this to happen.","Back in the 1970s, Kodak tried to give $25m to a black civil rights organisation in Rochester, New York. The company's shareholders rose up in arms: making this politically charged offering wasn't the reason they had entrusted Kodak with their money. The donation was withdrawn.","We need to have much clearer regulations on things like corporate funding of scientific research. Things need to be made explicit which are implicit.","Countries that need monies so that they can provide health care and education and shelter to their people shouldn't have to repay debts that we knowingly lent to bad regimes long since gone; and all illegitimate debts - debts lent to these terrible dictators like Saddam Hussein, like Suharto, like Marcos - must also be canceled.","I really believe in a globalist agenda, but globalization isn't just allowing companies to trade freely all over the world. It's about what types of rights and responsibilities come with that.","It's possible that Generation Facebook, accustomed as it is to a whole range of experiences that it only imbibes online, doesn't have the same need for physical interaction in order to be creative as previous generations still do. It's possible that Generation Facebook can co-create and collaborate quite happily from afar.","In an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing, we feel reassured by the almost parental-like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do.","Rather than empowering all, consumer and shareholder activism gives greatest voice to those with the most money in their pockets, those who can switch from seller to seller with relative ease. Consumer and shareholder activism is a form of protest that favours the middle classes, an outpouring of the dissatisfaction of the bourgeoisie.","Experience is not the poor relation of expertise. Valuable insights in business often come from the people on the ground.","People are looking for certainty. The more complex the world becomes, the more people look for people to give them certainty and tell them what to do. During the past few years of actively thinking about this, there is one thing that I have accepted: certainty is not out there. There is not one strategy to follow, and that's OK.","I don't believe you can reduce the world to a mathematical formula. I start with the world, assume it's complicated, and ask where can I get help from a whole range of disciplines.","My parents were entrepreneurs. I grew up believing in the power of innovation.","Stress makes us prone to tunnel vision, less likely to take in the information we need. Anxiety makes us more risk-averse than we would be regularly and more deferential.","We need to know how we are feeling. Mindfully acknowledging our feelings serves as an 'emotional thermostat' that recalibrates our decision making. It's not that we can't be anxious, it's that we need to acknowledge to ourselves that we are.","Without industry, finance and government consciously and collaboratively ensuring that capital flows to where it is needed in order to ensure the scaling up of climate change solutions, whatever deal is agreed risks never being realised.","What about those who help growth indirectly, those who stay at home and look after others - mothers, carers of elderly parents or sick relatives who save the state millions of pounds annually. What is their worth? How is their value to be determined?","My parents decided - because they were not going to teach us anything Jewish at home - to send both me and my sister to a Jewish primary school. So I went to Kerem Primary School in Hampstead Garden Suburb. But, for me, that school really didn't work that well.","My mother was really involved with the Refusenik campaign with Soviet Union Jews. They would come and stay at our house, some of them, after they managed to get out of the Soviet Union at the time. There were things that were Jewish-related happening in my house quite consistently, but it was much more from a kind of activist standpoint.","Women who have managed to get successful normally have had to carve out pretty much their own route for doing it, because there are few roadmaps for how, as a woman, you become successful. You think about having to do it yourself, you carve your own way. Does that relate to being Jewish?","I grew up in a home where I was literally told from a young age, 'No daughter of mine will ever wash a man's socks,' and I am pleased to say I never have. It was made clear that whatever I wanted to do I should aspire to, regardless of my gender.","If somebody tweets 'I like Coca-Cola,' does that mean that they're actually going to buy Coca-Cola? One can? Two cans? Three cans? If they retweet someone else's Tweet, does that mean they're going to buy it?","Language is too complex for a computer to understand. It's not going to be able to make sense of what people are saying en masse. We need a new type of discipline that puts together computer scientists and social scientists, who can add context to the situation.","Employees speak of being fearful opening emails and feeling increasingly helpless in the face of the deluge. Physiologically, we now know that the state of continuous disruption puts us into a constant state of hormone-induced stress.","Email is having an increasingly pernicious effect. Not only is it having a perceptible effect on productivity, it's skewing what it is we focus on. The immediate increasingly crowds out the important.","Surely in a world of email, video conferencing and virtual assistants, isn't being expected to show up at the office extremely anachronistic? Yet to date it seems that where one works does matter. That creativity and innovation do feed off physical interactions between people.","With clothing being designed that allows you to be hugged virtually, video conferencing becoming ever sharper, and our social and romantic lives increasingly taking place online, the gap between the physical and the virtual is getting ever smaller.","The challenge for corporations, if offices were to become obsolete, is twofold. How will they be able to retain their distinct cultures? And how will they be able to ensure that all employees, wherever they work from, share a united identity and vision?","When Apple introduced its game-changing iPhone in 2007, Nokia was caught sleeping on the job. Although it had actually developed an iPhone-style device - complete with a color touchscreen, maps, online shopping, the lot - some seven years earlier. Astonishingly, it never released the product.","We are all socialists now, it seems. John McCain, David Cameron and Gordon Brown attack bankers' irresponsible behaviour and salaries, and call for state intervention in the financial markets. But these calls will not get them elected or re-elected if they are addressed only to the banking sector.","We are living in a time in which movies such as 'Super Size Me' and 'An Inconvenient Truth' have made box-office history, and books such as 'No Logo' and my own, 'The Silent Takeover,' are bestsellers.","The term 'glass ceiling' was coined in 1984. More than 20 years later, the ceiling has barely cracked. There isn't a single country in the world that has as many female as male politicians. In business, the situation is even worse. Its highest echelon - the board - remains a chauvinist's dream.","When it comes to getting more women into parliament, politicians have at least started to take active measures. The British Labour Party introduced all-female shortlists in 1997.","Having women on boards is good for women, good for the economy and good for society. A win-win-win outcome: how rare.","Philanthropists today want input into how their monies are being deployed. The big question is, can governments use this insight to sell the rich the idea of paying more tax rather than spend more on charitable giving?","It's not that I am against the rich giving money to charities. I'm all for it, and we should think of ways of encouraging more of it. But I also believe that states, rather than individuals, are ultimately a better bet for delivering a fair and just world and reconciling differing interests.","Most philanthropists would still rather donate to elite schools, concert halls or religious groups than help the poor or sick.","At the end of the day, philanthropy can only ever be an adjunct to what governments provide. And government coffers need to be replenished.","I grew up in a highly political home. My mother was the co-chair of the 300 Group, an organisation whose aim was to get more women MPs into parliament, and she herself stood in the 1987 election, the year before she died.","It is a world of extremes, which can be characterised most clearly in terms of exclusion. That means political exclusion, whereby the rights of citizens are marginalised by the interests of big business: George W Bush's environmental policy, for example, is clearly formulated in the interests of U.S. energy companies.","We must embrace a new agenda based on inclusiveness; a commitment to reconnecting the social and the economic; a relinking of the latter to a plausible redistributive system; and a determination to ensure that everyone has access to justice. All these things are within our reach.","Terrorism and trade cannot be the only issues on which the world unites. We must commit ourselves to a global coalition to deal with exclusion, too.","With consumers having ever more choice, corporations must invest more and more in courting public opinion.","Consumers, unlike voters, expect an immediate response to their concerns; and companies, unlike governments, do not have the luxury of a mid-term lull.","The World Trade Organization is an organization that defends trade interests. I think the problem is less that they exist. The problem is that internationally we've only got an organization that protects trade interests. Surely we need some kind of counterweight to protect human rights and the environment, too.","I was - the last protest I was at was in Genoa, where I got tear gassed, and I hate tear gas, and I hate being in crowds.","Debt vultures are really the scum at the bottom of the pond. These are guys who buy up the debts of the world's poorest countries on the secondary market. You can go buy debts of a country like Peru, for example, at a real discount. Why? Because people think that the debts won't be repaid.","Most of us are going through life without interrogating whether our decision-making processes are fit for purpose. And that's something we need to change - especially when the stakes are high and the decisions are of real import.","Most organisations do not actively seek out input from their lower echelons.","Most of us are 'ultraconformists' when it comes to who we are most likely to follow... to socialise with, or even who we are most likely to hire.","It's actually very surprising how little we think about the quality of our decision-making and how we could improve it. How absent decision-making classes are from educational curricula. How little we think about how it is we think.","Things do go wrong. Not everyone benefits from the capitalist dream.","We are deluged with information. We have to process now three times as much data as we would have done 50 years ago. We're bombarded with tweets, with emails - a state of continuous disruption - and that's bad for our decision making and bad for our thinking.","You want to challenge experts, because experts get a lot wrong. Doctors misdiagnose one time in five. In the U.S. and Canada, 50,000 people die every year who would not have had to.","Our guts can really mislead us. Sometimes, what we think of as our gut is something else, like an outside influence. If you're going to buy an apartment and it smells of freshly baked bread, you're more likely to want to buy it.","I've become increasingly fascinated with social media to improve on traditional ways of preparing for and predicting the future."],"Norm Coleman":["It is intellectually dishonest to look backwards with all the facts and judge the decisions that were made with almost none of the facts, or the facts that existed hidden in the normal cloud of endless speculation of what might happen.","The Pell Grant is more than a financial aid program for college students in need. It is the right thing to do for America's college students, and it is the right thing to do for America's economy.","We have to get away from the class warfare and recognize that we are growing jobs by helping small business.","Let me be clear, the discussions about Social Security are not about the retirement security of those Americans who are 55 or older - the Social Security system for those folks 55 and over will not change in any way shape of form - no ifs, ands, or buts.","Our society has changed in unforeseeable ways since Social Security was created. For example, we are living longer, healthier, and more productive lives and while this is all great news, this has also placed added pressure on America's retirement system.","Let us never forget that terrorism at its heart, at its evil heart, is a psychological war. It endeavors to break the spirit and the resolve of those it attacks by creating a lose-lose situation.","It is easy to criticize, particularly in a political season. But to lead is something altogether different. The leader must live in the real world of the price that might be paid for the goal that has been set.","America has a strategic interest in continuing to welcome international students at our colleges, universities, and high schools. Attracting the world's top scientific scholars helps to keep our economy competitive.","Our cattlemen have given us the safest, most abundant, most affordable beef supply in the world and I trust their judgment. And if you look at consumer confidence in this country, so does the American public.","There is a real opportunity right now as parents and grandparents to come up with a plan that leaves our kids with something better than we have; that is, an opportunity to own, build, and grow a nest egg of their own.","You get paid more at McDonald's than you do under the existing minimum wage."],"Norm Crosby":["When you go into court you are putting your fate into the hands of twelve people who weren't smart enough to get out of jury duty.","It was a melting pot in Las Vegas. You got every age level, every ethnic background, every social aura - it was an absolute Americana audience... people who were there to celebrate occasions; people who were there to gamble; people who were there because they were awed by the whole Vegas operation. Tourists.","A handicap is only if you let it be a handicap.","My hearing loss was essentially due to noise exposure during my military service. I was on an anti-submarine sub-chaser in WWII, and we had lots of depth charges going off all around us. There were plenty of explosions, and they were loud!","I've been on the 'Tonight Show' a million times, and I'd be embarrassed to do the same thing more than once.","Old is when people compliment your alligator shoes, and you're not wearing any.","I think it's the most wonderful thing in the world to have an identity, something the audience can remember you for.","'USA Today' once did a big article called, 'Who said it? Was it Norm or George Bush?' They had quotes of mine and quotes of his, and they went to some congressmen and senators and said, 'Who said it?' It was hysterical.","I don't ever remember overcoming adversities.","I met Elvis first in Las Vegas. I think I was appearing with Tom Jones and he came backstage to say hello to Tom or we went to his dressing room to say hello.","I was the first spokesperson for the Better Hearing Institute in Washington. And that's the message we tried to send out - there is hearing help out there, and the technology and options are amazing.","Every city you go to has television and radio talk shows that are dying to give young comics a showcase. They all want to be able to say that so-and-so started here, got his first break on this show.","A young comic, if he's any good, can easily get on 'Carson' or 'Griffin' or 'Dinah Shore,' because they want to say the same thing, that they discovered the new talent.","I'm a great audience myself. I tried to keep in the background while others were on, but sometimes I'd just get hysterical.","It's extremely hard work keeping fresh.","I think it is - the biggest plus the performer can have is to be a little unique.","I don't do the same show twice. I've never done a show word for word.","Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Dale Evans - these people are giants, legends; their names are household words. Of course, so's Jell-O.","That, to me, is what comedy is all about: keeping fresh and keeping current and changing with the times.","When people have hearing loss, I think they often take that burden and pass it on to their friends and family, and we make them scream and yell at us so we can hear! But I think it's better to take responsibility and wear hearing aids!","Hearing aids didn't cause any problem with my social life, my career, no problem at all, and I've been wearing them for a long time. As a matter of fact, once I became an entertainer and started working on television, I was probably the first performer to talk about hearing problems on the air.","Although I had a good job as an advertising manager for a shoe company in Boston, I really liked to fool around with comedy.","I would watch 'The Ed Sullivan Show' and borrow a few lines here and there from guests like Red Buttons and Buddy Hackett to create a routine. Then I started getting invited to do political functions like the governor's birthday ball or mayor's dinner."],"Norm Dicks":["The Endangered Species Act is the strongest and most effective tool we have to repair the environmental harm that is causing a species to decline.","These subsidies from four European governments, which include aircraft launch assistance, capital injections, debt forgiveness, have enabled Airbus to develop and range market airliners well below cost.","The time has come for the American government to recognize the damage that has occurred to our economy, and to take firm action to curtail what I believe is both unfair and illegal foreign competition.","Over 30 years ago, Airbus was founded by a European consortium of French, German, and later Spanish and British companies to compete in the large commercial aircraft industry with U.S. companies.","In 2003, the value of Airbus's orders was more than twice as much as Boeing's.","More than 60,000 jobs have been lost in the commercial aviation industry in the United States since 1999.","During the past 30 years, European governments have provided more than $15 billion in the form of low- and no-cost loans to Airbus for the specific purpose of developing new aircraft lines.","For all of us who have been involved in the recovery efforts to bring back and strengthen wild salmon runs, we fear that this change in policy could lead to further declines in these wild stocks.","Overtime, hatchery fish tend to show signs of domestication and these traits adapted to the hatchery environment can make it more difficult to survive in the wild.","In fact, at Olympic National Park in my district, they 3 years ago had 130 summer employees they brought in for temporary work. This summer they have 25 because they cannot afford more.","What I did was sit down with the Washington State officials, with the historic preservation people, with the tribe, the local community, the port of Port Angeles, and we worked this thing out, and we protected the tribe's interest.","The Smithsonian Institute is one of the most popular agencies of government in the United States.","This funding from the National Endowment for the Arts has been like the Good Housekeeping seal of approval.","Mr. Chairman, obviously a $60 million cut in the National Endowment for the Arts would be a disaster.","I remember those great days when we were at $176 million before the Reagan Revolution came to town.","So when people go to the park this summer, they are not going to have the same quality of a visit. There is not going to be a ranger out on the trail to tell them about the important cultural and historic areas within the Olympic National Park.","In my own area, Hood Canal, we are working with the USGS on dealing with this oxygenation problem.","We are also working on the restoration of salmon runs, and we are doing a new process of mass marking with these fish so we can tell the wild fish from the hatchery fish.","Last year, Congress gave the Department of Defense the authority to design a new civilian personnel system for its employees as part of the defense authorization bill.","The American people are going to judge the majority party here today. If they go out here and vote for this rule that allows this provision to be stricken, they are voting against the men and women in the military of our country."],"Norm MacDonald":["All my life's about is cracking up people and them cracking me up and trying not to think about dying. That doesn't cost very much money.","When I was a kid, everybody that played golf was an old man. Until Tiger showed up, they weren't in very good shape.","In math, you could get 100 percent. It was very fair. That's what I liked about math. You could figure it out, and the teacher couldn't have a stupid opinion about it.","When I hear a guy lost a battle to cancer, that really did bother me, that that's a term. It implies that he failed and that somebody else that defeated cancer is heroic and courageous.","I watch political shows for a number of weeks in a row, and all I see are guys arguing with each other over issues I have no idea about. My brother, he loves war-torn places. My dad would always read the paper and tell me I should watch CNN, but I usually wind up watching 'Breaking Bad.'","In theatres, you're kind of disconnected. Also, it's way too big for the likes of me. Unless you're Robin Williams or someone that can fill a stage with movement and energy, it just looks like a small man on a big stage.","My dad had this thing - everyone in Canada wants to play hockey; that's all they want to do. So when I was a kid, whenever we skated my dad would not let us on the ice without hockey sticks, because of this insane fear we would become figure skaters!","Comedy is surprises, so if you're intending to make somebody laugh and they don't laugh, that's funny.","When I was young, I'd watch guys on 'The Tonight Show', Buddy Hackett, guys like that, where all they'd be is funny. Later, I remember, on 'Late Night with Letterman', I remember he'd have Jay Leno and Richard Lewis as first guests and the entire point was to entertain and be funny, and I think talk shows have kind of lost that.","You can't love your team without hating another team.","I sort of try to write everything for me. I'm a huge sports fan but have no interest in minutiae. I don't remember who won Super Bowls five years ago or listen to sports talk radio. I'm trying to make sure the jokes are self-contained so they're accessible to everyone.","I don't like sports where it's like, you watch a guy on a motorcycle flip or something, then another guy does it, it looks exactly the same, and then at the end one guy gets higher points! It seems so arbitrary; I don't know who's ahead ever.","I think clever people think that poor people are stupid.","I'm not gay, so I don't know much about Broadway musicals.","It's a very odd thing with Hollywood, where you do stand-up, you're good at it, then they go, 'How would you like to be a horrible actor?' Then you say, 'All right, that sounds good. I'll do that.'","I don't really like politics that much. And I like the order and simplicity of sports. They have an ending. You can argue with your friends about it, but in the end you still like sports. I almost love the fantasy world of sports more than the real world.","There are these showcase clubs where 14 guys will go on in a row and people are laughing at everything, and I'm like - 'I can't laugh that much. That's so weird to me.'","Stand-up has the best writers, because it's the hardest writing by a million miles.","I don't have any ego about it, but I find there's not a great work ethic in show business. A lot of people are in it to make money, and coming from stand-up, you have to work so hard because almost nothing works, and if you lose the audience for three minutes, you're dead.","I'm happy doing stand-up, but I'll probably do a television show eventually. If not, I'll delve into this Internet world and decide best how to harness it. What I like best about it is the independent movie style and the ability to just be completely reckless within that world. I like that a lot. I just have to acquaint myself with technology.","I just hate plugs. It just doesn't seem entertaining to me. I've never plugged anything in my life on a talk show ever. I understand people use that vehicle. It's just not very entertaining.","Compared to politics, I think sports is funnier, because it's inconsequential. And politics can be real important and all that. The more pointless something is, the funnier it is, you know? And the more grave or important things are... You know, some comedians can get this disease where they get serious all the time.","I love writing - it's the best. But I really hate collaboration.","So much in L.A. is waiting. It's so irritating. That's what's good about stand-up. You can go away, and you don't have to sit and wait by your phone. But it is very frustrating.","I'd say Jon Stewart has remained funny the entire time. Jon always makes it funny first. And he's just, he's talking about serious things, but in a funny way. Other comedians will talk about serious things in a serious way, and then you don't know what's going on.","I would love to stay at SNL forever. But you can't stay in the same place. People think you're a loser.","I always told everybody the perfect joke would be where the setup and punch line were identical.","I've just seen really, really funny guys, and if I didn't know them, I wouldn't know they were funny from the television. I don't know what it does, it just sucks it away.","I like doing a funny show where I don't have to act and fall in love with a girl.","I just like doing standup, that's all I'm interested in or good at.","It got very tedious saying the same jokes in the same way with the same attitude.","I don't really like doing big stand-up. Whenever I do theaters, I don't like 'em. I don't think they're right for stand-up. I've seen people in theaters, and it just doesn't work, because you're talking to the guy next to you the whole time.","I sort of have open invitations from a lot of people to do TV. But it's very hard for me to do roles in sitcoms and movies because I'm not a great actor, so if the material isn't good, I'm in torment while I do it.","A lot of people think I'm difficult to work with. It's not like I really want to do that much stuff, so it doesn't really matter. I guess I'm somewhat difficult when it comes to comedy.","I don't know anything about politics. Like, zero. Nothing.","Compared to politics, I think sports is funnier, because it's inconsequential. And politics can be real important and all that. The more pointless something is, the funnier it is, you know?","If you're watching a comedian on television and he's making a political point, I would say he's gotten too serious.","I've been offered political shows before, and I don't know anything about politics and I feel uncomfortable making political opinions - there's consequences to them. I often think I'm wrong, so I really don't like getting in political or religious discussions because of the giant possibility that I might be wrong.","I'm no good at anything but comedy, which I think I'm good at. I'm absolutely no good at networking; I'm terrible at acting; I'm terrible at dealing with executives; I'm terrible at collaborating. And I say whatever I want to say. But I think I'm good enough at comedy that I can survive. And I don't really have an ambition for money.","With the computer and stuff, the difference between a rich guy and a poor guy, to me, is nothing. Because I don't like big houses, I don't drive a car, so you know, I just live in a small apartment and I have my computer, which is really cool.","I never do impressions, but I probably should. People like that stuff.","I have always loved Las Vegas. It's a traditional place for lounge comics to perform, and I love that.","I miss seeing real comics, Shecky Greene and Buddy Hackett, those types. I like straight stand-up, talking about the Olympics and why I feel obligated to watch them. 'Why am I watching archery at 4 in the afternoon?'","You're trying your best to make people laugh; then if you fail, they hate you. But your intent's the same. It's not like you're trying to do evil to them.","I never had any interest in sitcoms or motion pictures or anything like that.","Whenever I do theaters, I don't like 'em. I don't think they're right for stand-up.","I started on 'Saturday Night Live' the same time Conan started on Late Night. We just had a relationship because I would be upstairs in the studio and whenever he couldn't get a guest - which was often back then since he was just starting out - he would just call me down to be a guest.","I like the order and simplicity of sports. They have an ending. You can argue with your friends about it, but in the end, you still like sports. I almost love the fantasy world of sports more than the real world.","I like to do talk show appearances where I get to just be myself, and I do stand-up where I can completely be myself. That's what I've always loved the most, of anything.","I didn't really want to inject myself into anything political. A lot of people were asking me at the time about Jay and Conan, and I hate doing anything serious.","Letterman is very intimidating because he's so funny, so you have to be really prepared. Also, he's a little squeamish about certain things, so you have to always be on guard to please him.","I'm a huge sports fan but have no interest in minutiae. I don't remember who won Super Bowls five years ago or listen to sports talk radio.","In terms of merit, sports has mathematical statistics. That's how you know who the best player is.","I don't know anything about politics. I wouldn't put too much into my prediction on politics."],"Norma McCorvey":["It's not your body, it's not your choice, because you got that from God. He gave that to you.","I was the Jane Roe of Roe vs. Wade, but Jane Roe has been laid to rest.","The holocaust against the unborn is the greatest sin they could ever do or even ever participate in.","I used the name Jane Roe because I didn't want my personal name to be involved in it.","I looked at a fetal development chart at the Operation Rescue Office in Dallas. I had a lot of emotions stirring up inside of me. That's when I decided that it was wrong in any stage of pregnancy.","They tried to discredit me. I used to tell them, There's many wonderful people out there who can't have children, who would want to have these children.","They could have been nice to me instead of treating me like an idiot.","It was a mutual thing. I made a deal with them: I asked them if they did not bring out the place card of Malachi, I would let them have two minutes with each one of my patients.","I really didn't know there was two sides to the abortion issue.","I didn't attend any of the court proceedings.","The abortionist I worked for, he's a very greedy man, a selfish man.","Patients would come in and say, Well, my baby is going to have a cleft palate. I'm going like, that's not a reason. And the doctor would do the abortion.","I don't think there is a good reason for an abortion, but Dr. Jasper made me really realize it was just a racket. He was just doing it for the money. He didn't care about the women.","Dr. Jasper didn't care if they got their checkups, their medications.","I'm the computer operator for Operation Rescue National.","There's a feminist writer, Naomi Wolfe, who is reconsidering her position on abortion.","It doesn't make any difference what religion you are, or how young you are or how old you are-if they go to these abortion mills and stand there and pray-that would make a lot of difference.","We live in a society today where these children can be wanted children. Even if you don't want to keep this child after you've had it, there's plenty of young couples out there, that want children.","Father God, we just ask You to open Your wide, wide arms and look down upon us, Lord, and lead us, and let us know what we should do to stop this, this terrible, terrible holocaust.","I've got so much to do, I don't have time to sit down and be sad.","I am Roe.","I am serving the Lord and helping women save babies.","I think everyone should sit down and write a book. It's a lot like therapy but a lot less expensive.","If they don't care about me, how can they possibly care about anyone else?","I don't hate them any more like I used to. I just don't like them very much.","I felt like they only cared about what I could do for them, not what they could do for me."],"Norma Shearer":["It is impossible to get anything made or accomplished without stepping on some toes; enemies are inevitable when one is a doer.","Never let them see you in public after you've turned thirty-five. You're finished if you do!","A woman today is good, or she is bad, according to the way she does a thing - and not because of the thing itself.","The morals of yesterday are no more. They are as dead as the day they were lived. Economic independence has put woman on exactly the same footing as man.","Somehow or other I always got myself rigged up in something sensational.","An adventure may be worn as a muddy spot or it may be worn as a proud insignia. It is the woman wearing it who makes it the one thing or the other.","I get whatever placidity I have from my father. But my mother taught me how to take it on the chin.","Being a motion picture actress is the pitch of ecstasy."],"Norman Angell":["Every nation sincerely desires peace; and all nations pursue courses which if persisted in, must make peace impossible.","Everywhere I go I see increasing evidence of people swirling about in a human cesspit of their own making.","The greatest service we can do the common man is to abolish him and make all men uncommon.","God has made Canada one of those nations which cannot be conquered and cannot be destroyed, except by itself."],"Norman Borlaug":["When wheat is ripening properly, when the wind is blowing across the field, you can hear the beards of the wheat rubbing together. They sound like the pine needles in a forest. It is a sweet, whispering music that once you hear, you never forget.","Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before.","The lack of roads in Africa greatly hinders agriculture, education, and development.","One of the greatest threats to mankind today is that the world may be choked by an explosively pervading but well camouflaged bureaucracy.","Without food, man can live at most but a few weeks; without it, all other components of social justice are meaningless.","When the Nobel Peace Prize Committee designated me the recipient of the 1970 award for my contribution to the 'green revolution,' they were in effect, I believe, selecting an individual to symbolize the vital role of agriculture and food production in a world that is hungry, both for bread and for peace.","There are no miracles in agricultural production.","We must recognize the fact that adequate food is only the first requisite for life. For a decent and humane life, we must also provide an opportunity for good education, remunerative employment, comfortable housing, good clothing, and effective and compassionate medical care.","Civilization as it is known today could not have evolved, nor can it survive, without an adequate food supply.","Food is the moral right of all who are born into this world.","Almost certainly, however, the first essential component of social justice is adequate food for all mankind.","Man seems to insist on ignoring the lessons available from history.","Therefore I feel that the aforementioned guiding principle must be modified to read: If you desire peace, cultivate justice, but at the same time cultivate the fields to produce more bread; otherwise there will be no peace.","If people want to believe that the organic food has better nutritive value, it's up to them to make that foolish decision. But there's absolutely no research that shows that organic foods provide better nutrition.","Contrasting sharply, in the developing countries represented by India, Pakistan, and most of the countries in Asia and Africa, seventy to eighty percent of the population is engaged in agriculture, mostly at the subsistence level.","The destiny of world civilization depends upon providing a decent standard of living for all mankind.","Man's survival, from the time of Adam and Eve until the invention of agriculture, must have been precarious because of his inability to ensure his food supply.","Central African farmers don't have any animal power because sleeping sickness kills all the animals - cattle, the horses, the burros and the mules. So draft animals don't exist, and farming is all by hand, and the hand tools are hoes and machetes.","Cereal production in the rain-fed areas still remains relatively unaffected by the impact of the green revolution, but significant change and progress are now becoming evident in several countries.","Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the 'Population Monster.'","Water covers about 70 percent of the Earth's surface. Of this total, only about 2.5 percent is fresh water, and most of this is frozen in the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland, in soil moisture, or in deep aquifers not readily accessible for human use.","Plant diseases, drought, desolation, despair were recurrent catastrophes during the ages - and the ancient remedies: supplications to supernatural spirits or gods.","During the past three years spectacular progress has been made in increasing wheat, rice, and maize production in several of the most populous developing countries of southern Asia, where widespread famine appeared inevitable only five years ago.","Nevertheless, the number of farmers, small as well as large, who are adopting the new seeds and new technology is increasing very rapidly, and the increase in numbers during the past three years has been phenomenal.","If the world population continues to increase at the same rate, we will destroy the species.","We will be guilty of criminal negligence, without extenuation, if we permit future famines.","The forgotten world is made up primarily of the developing nations, where most of the people, comprising more than fifty percent of the total world population, live in poverty, with hunger as a constant companion and fear of famine a continual menace.","I am but one member of a vast team made up of many organizations, officials, thousands of scientists, and millions of farmers - mostly small and humble - who for many years have been fighting a quiet, oftentimes losing war on the food production front.","The green revolution has an entirely different meaning to most people in the affluent nations of the privileged world than to those in the developing nations of the forgotten world.","For, behind the scenes, halfway around the world in Mexico, were two decades of aggressive research on wheat that not only enabled Mexico to become self-sufficient with respect to wheat production but also paved the way to rapid increase in its production in other countries.","If some consumers believe that it's better from the point of view of their health to have organic food, God bless them. Let them buy it. Let them pay a bit more.","It's a free society. But don't tell the world that we can feed the present population without chemical fertilizer. That's when this misinformation becomes destructive.","It's amazing how often campaigners in rich countries think poor people don't get backache.","Pricing water delivery closer to its real costs is a necessary step to improving use efficiency.","Abnormal stresses and strains tend to accentuate man's animal instincts and provoke irrational and socially disruptive behavior among the less stable individuals in the maddening crowd.","There can be no permanent progress in the battle against hunger until the agencies that fight for increased food production and those that fight for population control unite in a common effort.","I like the back country, wildlife and all of that, but it's wrong to force poor people to live that way.","The breakup of the former Soviet Union has caused its grain output to plummet, but if the new republics recover economically, they could produce vast amounts of food.","Yet food is something that is taken for granted by most world leaders despite the fact that more than half of the population of the world is hungry.","Man can and must prevent the tragedy of famine in the future instead of merely trying with pious regret to salvage the human wreckage of the famine, as he has so often done in the past.","Unless there is one master gene for yield, which I'm guessing there is not, engineering for yield will be very complex. It may happen eventually, but through the coming decades, we must assume that gene engineering will not be the answer to the world's food problems.","In my Nobel lecture, I suggested we had until the year 2000 to tame the population monster, and then food shortages would take us under. Now I believe we have a little longer.","As far as plants are concerned, they can't tell whether that nitrate ion comes from artificial chemicals or from decomposed organic matter.","These places I've seen have clubbed my mind - they are so poor and depressing. I don't know what we can do to help these people, but we've got to do something.","Africa needs roads. Roads bring know-how and fertilizer to farmers and ideas and business for commerce.","Some of the environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the salt of the earth, but many of them are elitists.","Roads are essential to any type of agricultural development.","In future irrigation schemes, water drainage and removal systems should be budgeted from the start of the project. Unfortunately, adding such costs to the original project often will result in a poor return on investment. Society then will have to decide how much it is willing to subsidize new irrigation development.","Clearly, we need to rethink our attitudes about water and move away from thinking of it as nearly a free good and a God-given right.","Supplying food to sub-Saharan African countries is made very complex because of a lack of infrastructure."],"Norman Cook":["I make music for the hips, not the head.","They couldn't do a drugs story on me because I'd already done one on myself.","I think English people were a lot better at breakdancing than they were at making records.","I'm very superstitious... I never shout at magpies, walk under ladders or put my shoes on the table.","Most people don't get a fair crack of the whip.","On top of the horror of separating from your wife, you have to go through it in public.","I try to make people smile and dance, not think about things or educate them."],"Norman Cousins":["Death is not the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss is what dies inside us while we live.","Hope is independent of the apparatus of logic.","The eternal quest of the individual human being is to shatter his loneliness.","Life is an adventure in forgiveness.","Hearty laughter is a good way to jog internally without having to go outdoors.","Your heaviest artillery will be your will to live. Keep that big gun going.","If something comes to life in others because of you, then you have made an approach to immortality.","It makes little difference how many university courses or degrees a person may own. If he cannot use words to move an idea from one point to another, his education is incomplete.","Laughter is inner jogging.","The human body experiences a powerful gravitational pull in the direction of hope. That is why the patient's hopes are the physician's secret weapon. They are the hidden ingredients in any prescription.","A library is the delivery room for the birth of ideas, a place where history comes to life.","Wisdom consists of the anticipation of consequences.","He who keeps his cool best wins.","The tragedy of life is in what dies inside a man while he lives - the death of genuine feeling, the death of inspired response, the awareness that makes it possible to feel the pain or the glory of other men in yourself.","Optimism doesn't wait on facts. It deals with prospects. Pessimism is a waste of time.","History is a vast early warning system.","A book is like a piece of rope; it takes on meaning only in connection with the things it holds together.","Cynicism is intellectual treason.","The main failure of education is that it has not prepared people to comprehend matters concerning human destiny.","People are never more insecure than when they become obsessed with their fears at the expense of their dreams.","If the United Nations is to survive, those who represent it must bolster it; those who advocate it must submit to it; and those who believe in it must fight for it.","My reason nourishes my faith and my faith my reason.","The capacity for hope is the most significant fact of life. It provides human beings with a sense of destination and the energy to get started.","A library, to modify the famous metaphor of Socrates, should be the delivery room for the birth of ideas - a place where history comes to life.","Just as there is no loss of basic energy in the universe, so no thought or action is without its effects, present or ultimate, seen or unseen, felt or unfelt.","It is reasonable to expect the doctor to recognize that science may not have all the answers to problems of health and healing.","The way a book is read, which is to say, the qualities a reader brings to a book can have as much to do with its worth as anything the author puts into it.","Respect for the fragility and importance of an individual life is still the mark of an educated man.","A human being fashions his consequences as surely as he fashions his goods or his dwelling. Nothing that he says, thinks or does is without consequences.","Man is not imprisoned by habit. Great changes in him can be wrought by crisis - once that crisis can be recognized and understood.","What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that men set foot on the moon but that they set eye on the earth.","Government in the U.S. today is a senior partner in every business in the country.","The individual is capable of both great compassion and great indifference. He has it within his means to nourish the former and outgrow the latter.","We will not have peace by afterthought.","The only security for the American people today, or for any people, is to be found through the control of force rather than the use of force.","Where is the indignation about the fact that the US and USSR have thirty thousand pounds of destructive force for every human being in the world?"],"Norman Davies":["Serenity is the balance between good and bad, life and death, horrors and pleasures. Life is, as it were, defined by death. If there wasn't death of things, then there wouldn't be any life to celebrate.","Only by painting the great panorama of history, can the great history-reading public be entertained or satisfied.","Law and Justice are the most vindictive gang in Europe.","States seem to have a natural life cycle, and anything can occur to change them into something else, and that something might be no bad thing.","Our mental maps are distorted by who are the 'winners' of history and who are the powers of today.","Historical change is like an avalanche. The starting point is a snow-covered mountainside that looks solid. All changes take place under the surface and are rather invisible.","For people familiar with Eastern Europe, Marci Shore's 'The Taste of Ashes' is, in spite of its subject matter, delicious. A professor at Yale with much experience in Eastern Europe, she writes with great sureness of touch, weaving personal recollections with intellectual commentary and ideas with emotions, including her own.","People don't see very often their death coming... Look at the French Revolution: The king of France was thinking in the 1780s, 'We're doing rather better than my father in the 1770s.'","I first heard of General Anders and his army more than 50 years ago. I admired him then, and I admire him still; and I feel a special bond with the men, women and children whom he rescued from hunger, disease, and official abuse. Theirs is a story of endurance and fortitude that gives one faith in the human spirit.","Bulgaria was the only Axis country to deflect insistent German demands for the deportation of its Jews.","Young people have to learn in a cocoon filled with false optimism. Unlike their parents and grandparents, they grow up with very little sense of the pitiless passage of time.","It's the historian's job not to ridicule the myths, but to show the difference between myth and reality.","I always needle a bit when people say I'm a champion of the Poles, because I've always had a very multinational view of Poland.","Poland is the natural bridge between East and West.","It was in the 20th century that national sovereignty really ruled the roost, and the E.U. was formed to cure that.","Any historian worth their salt should be aware of wars, conflicts, catastrophes. They happen. This is part of the panorama.","Poland was the racial laboratory of the Nazis. This is where they started to put their abhorrent theories into practice.","Winners of wars get a standing start in the post-war stakes of remembrance.","In the years of the Red Terror that followed the Bolshevik Revolution, the voice of dissent was stifled by universal denunciations, house searches, and preventive arrests.","I can just remember the blitz of Manchester, or perhaps my father's tales about the blitz of Manchester. I can remember the blackout, the powdered eggs, and the gas masks. But I think no British person should pretend that being resident in England could count as being in the thick of the action.","The Black Sea is Eastern Europe's counterpart to the Mediterranean.","At the end of the Roman Empire, in the Byzantine period, the empire shrinks and shrinks until it consists of one city, Constantinople, and the Ottoman Turks can encircle it.","In essence, the tragedy of the Warsaw Rising resulted from a systemic breakdown of the Grand Alliance.","The one certainly for anyone in the path of an avalanche is this: standing still is not an option.","Myth-making is absolutely necessary to create the simplified images that people live off.","The Russian myths of the Second World War are still intact.","The last years of fading communism provided an ideal environment for Poland's Catholic Church, which acted as an umbrella for dissenters of all sorts.","It is important to remember that John Paul II was not an American or a Frenchman.","Poland in the 1990s saw a surge of unrestrained, American-style capitalism. With millions of Poles living in the U.S.A., the defeat of communism led many to aim for a lifestyle derivative of Chicago or Detroit.","There is a real danger of the United Kingdom breaking up. There is a loss of common identity.","The Euro Sceptics are the English National Party in disguise, and they have poor old David Cameron over a barrel.","Every austerity measure that Cameron and George Osborne make is being presented in Scotland as the English starving us.","It's unimaginable to meet a Pole or a German who does not know about the history of their country. But lots of English people don't know the difference between Britain and England.","I do belong to the club which doesn't see a distinction between academic history and popular history.","I don't see why a book shouldn't be intellectually sound, entertaining, and fun to read. Historians who write academic history, which is unreadable, are basically wasting their time.","History is very much bound up in family experience.","History must give the Poles the principal credit for bringing the Soviet bloc to its knees.","In the long run, Europe will certainly move toward unification. But it will be a process of push and pull, and there will be resistance.","Each side tries to legitimize their aims by appealing to history, sometimes selectively choosing episodes and other times just by inventing history.","Nothing stands still. Everything is moving in some direction or another.","The E.U. is an organization that was created after the Second World War for calming down the nationalism of member states, and it did so very successfully.","So long as classical education and classical prejudices prevailed, educated Englishmen inevitably saw ancient Britain as an alien land.","Traditionally, historians thought in terms of invasions: the Celts took over the islands, then the Romans, then the Anglo-Saxons. It now seems much more likely that the resident population doesn't change as much as thought. The people stay put but are reculturalized by some new dominant culture.","The Law and Justice government does not want a bunch of foreign historians to decide what goes on in 'their' museum.","The 'politics of memory' policy appears to work largely by insinuation.","Why does a state last a thousand years? Why not 999? Why not a thousand and one? What are the events that finally bring the whole thing down? That is what I am asking.","All political institutions will end sooner or later. The question is when and how.","It's our vanity that makes us think that what forms part of our world today must be stable and secure.","The idea that historians write the definitive version of something that will last for all time is less current than it used to be.","All states and nations, however great, bloom for a season and are replaced.","In 1945, when the Second World War technically ends in Poland, the incoming Soviet army liberates some groups of people but begins to oppress the general population, in some ways more harshly than it had happened before.","One might have thought that 70 years was time enough to work out what really happened in 1939. It isn't the case. Misunderstandings and misinformation abound.","Nowadays, it is no longer possible to maintain that the Nazi-Soviet pact of 23 August 1939 was a fiction invented by bourgeois-imperialist enemies. Everyone has seen the film clips of Herr Ribbentrop landing in Moscow, and of Stalin smiling broadly as Ribbentrop and Molotov signed up side by side.","A bad historian is even more dangerous than dead documentary wood.","I find myself sick to death, tired of arguing about details with people who don't know basic facts.","Nearly all interested parties think I write too shortly on the subjects that interest them most.","There is history in condoms, there is history in lampshades, there is history in everything.","I first came across the Anders Army story by accident. When I first went to live in Oxford in the 1960s, I discovered that some of my close neighbours had been on the Anders trail.","I wanted to produce a book that would demonstrate not only the rich diversity of people who answered to Anders's command but also the extraordinary variety of their experiences and emotions: from death to despair, fear and longings and eventually to hope.","The most noticeable thing about the Soviet collapse was that it followed a natural course.","One of the few things that can be said for certain about Europe's prehistoric peoples is that they all came from somewhere else.","None of Europe's modern nations are genuinely native.","I happen to belong to that group opinion which holds the break-up of the United Kingdom to be imminent.","The advance of standard English culture was less assisted by government policy than by the sheer weight, wealth, and number of England's well-established cultural institutions.","The historical profession is nowhere famous for its tolerance, but there are not many countries where historians can expect to pay for their opinions with penal servitude or the firing squad.","Under Lenin, hardly less than under Stalin, historians harbored critical opinions at their peril. The writing, let alone the publication, of political diaries was virtually impossible.","Fifty years would seem to be time enough to prepare a definitive history of the Second World War. In an age of instant data-gathering, one might think that the historians could have arrived at a consensus for interpreting the main events of the war. In reality, no such consensus exists.","Why are some things remembered and others forgotten? That is the theme I want to pursue about the Second World War.","The shores of the Black Sea lend themselves to the literary genre that may be classified as 'cultural pilgrimage,' which is not just a higher form of travel writing but which has the further mission of reporting on present conditions and supplying neglected knowledge.","Transience is one of the fundamental characteristics both of the human condition and of the political order.","Capacity of human societies both to absorb and to discard cultures is much underestimated.","Northern Ireland must, in future, be absorbed into the Irish republic. Wales and Scotland must advance from devolution to full independent status. The four nations of these islands must commit themselves absolutely to the project of a United Europe.","The United Kingdom is not, and never has been, a nation state.","The question is whether a confident Europe will be a rival for North America - or whether they will work together and become a more unified bloc.","In the 21st century, there will probably be a reflex against the disintegration of traditional European culture. What started as a reaction will come full circle, and there will be a return to the roots.","One of the problems in the Ukrainian crisis is that very few Westerners know their history, or if they know it, what they learn is what we call the Russian version of history.","Europe's fragmentation puts the wider historical picture beyond reach."],"Norman Douglas":["The pine stays green in winter... wisdom in hardship.","You can tell the ideals of a nation by its advertising.","You can construct the character of a man and his age not only from what he does and says, but from what he fails to say and do.","It takes a wise man to handle a lie, a fool had better remain honest.","Many a man who thinks to found a home discovers that he has merely opened a tavern for his friends.","Education is a state-controlled manufactory of echoes.","The longer one lives, the more one realizes that nothing is a dish for every day.","There is in us a lyric germ or nucleus which deserves respect; it bids a man to ponder or create; and in this dim corner of himself he can take refuge and find consolations which the society of his fellow creatures does not provide.","A man can believe a considerable deal of rubbish, and yet go about his daily work in a rational and cheerful manner.","Never take a solemn oath. People think you mean it.","Distrust of authority should be the first civic duty.","To find a friend one must close one eye - to keep him, two.","What is all wisdom save a collection of platitudes?","Shall I give you my recipe for happiness? I find everything useful and nothing indispensable. I find everything wonderful and nothing miraculous. I reverence the body. I avoid first causes like the plague.","They who are all things to their neighbors cease to be anything to themselves.","The sublimity of wisdom is to do those things living, which are to be desired when dying."],"Norman Fell":["If I could do it all over again, I'd be the mailman. I love housewives, and I hate dogs. What more is there?","I enjoyed acting and marveled that one could get paid for doing it.","Hollywood sucks. I've got the bruises to prove it.","This hook nose and crab meister attitude has gotten me every job I've ever had. And more divorces than I care to remember.","I had a lot of time to think in the service; I swore that, if I survived, nothing would keep me from an acting career.","I was rejected by casting directors during the day. I attended class in the evening, then rode 90 miles on the train home."],"Norman Finkelstein":["No conditions justify torture.","The whole purpose of annual reviews is to keep you abreast of whether or not you are fulfilling the requirements of tenure.","The Zionists indeed learnt well from the Nazis. So well that it seems that their morally repugnant treatment of the Palestinians, and their attempts to destroy Palestinian society within Israel and the occupied territories, reveals them as basically Nazis with beards and black hats.","My parents often wondered why I would grow so indignant at the falsification and exploitation of the Nazi genocide. The most obvious answer is that it has been used to justify criminal policies of the Israeli state and U.S. support for these policies.","People have to liberate themselves, because liberation is not a single act. It's a question of eternal vigilance. Otherwise, you'll just become enslaved by someone else.","I was bashing Israel in the past because nobody else was exposing its true record. Many people are doing it now, so I switched hats from a critic of Israel to a diplomat who wants to resolve the conflict. I have not changed, but I think the spectrum has moved.","I think sometimes we underestimate just how vulnerable Israel is on the public-relations front. That's why they spend so much money on propaganda. And that's why they panic every time they feel like they're losing the propaganda war.","If there were an Oscar for best theatrical performance by a country, Israel would win every year. It's a country based on theater. It's a lunatic state - completely insane.","My original interest in the Nazi holocaust was personal. Both my father and mother were survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto and the Nazi concentration camps. Apart from my parents, every family member on both sides was exterminated by the Nazis.","I would not have stayed at a university if it told me upfront that a condition for me getting tenure. my views have to be filtered through Catholic values. I would consider it a betrayal of my parents' legacy.","Both my father and mother were survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto and the Nazi concentration camps. Apart from my parents, every family member on both sides was exterminated by the Nazis.","The Holocaust only emerged in American life after Israel's victory in the 1967 Six Day war against its Arab neighbours.","The moment you have massive social and political commentary trying to explain a phenomenon, then you know we are no longer dealing with a strictly psychiatric question.","International law says people fighting for self-determination can use force in order to achieve their independence.","Every victory of Hezbollah, I celebrate.","There are contradictory tendencies in American society. There's a huge range of activities that one can engage in that mark it as a quite free society. It's also true to say that the powers that be have so much control over how people think that there are fewer and fewer people who make use of the rights and information available to them.","I don't think it's a good thing to have Christian states, Muslim states, or any kind of ethnic states.","I don't feel particularly attached to Israel - 'nationalism,' as Noam Chomsky said, 'is not my cup of tea' - but I feel no particular need to demonize it.","Everybody wants peace. That's a truism. There is no point in accomplishing through war what you can accomplish through peace.","There is no way a non-Jew could say what I did in 'The Holocaust Industry' without being labelled a Holocaust denier. I am labelled a Holocaust denier, too.","When I was a young man, my mother said to me, 'You can't be a communist without being a militant atheist.' So I had to be a militant atheist because I wanted to be a communist.","I'm politically on the left, no question about it. I oppose sweatshops, I oppose exploitation of labour in the third world.","I earn - I'm not - I don't want to claim I'm a scholar of great stature, but I have made a certain reputation for myself, I've published several books, I've never been able to get a permanent teaching job.","You know, frankly speaking, money just doesn't figure largely in my world view.","People are motivated by the desires for privilege, for power, for profit. Those are not shocking revelations. Anyone who's had any experience in life knows these things.","Indeed, the field of Holocaust studies is replete with nonsense if not sheer fraud.","People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country.","I had been a Maoist, and then when the Gang of Four was overthrown, I was completely distraught. I was bedridden for three weeks; it was a very painful experience for me. Not only because I had been wrong, but because I felt really embarrassed that I had been lecturing and pontificating with such self-confidence.","I'm not a good writer, and I don't care. Unfortunately, after I left college, I didn't have time much for literature. I wish I did. Most of the time I read documents, and that's not going to help your writing. But I'm a very logical writer, and you can't get out of me. Once I've nailed you, you're finished.","I don't want to pretend to be a prophet or a saint. I'm very conscious of my limitations. I know my flaws. But I don't like lying.","Personal convictions are not politics. Personal convictions, if they become the subject of a group conviction, they become a cult.","Teaching is in my bones. I love to teach.","My books don't sell anymore. There are many reasons why they don't sell, but one of the reasons is because people don't read anymore. Forget about reading books of detail - they don't read at all.","I no longer say I'm unemployed. I say I'm unemployable. It's different. An unemployed suggests at a certain point in the future, you might be employed. That's not the case with me. I'm unemployable, and unfortunately, that's one of the bits of the web, in particular of Google.","The real goal of politics has to be getting people to act on what they already know was wrong.","I think that people like Bloomberg, they're complete thugs. No question about it. But on the other hand, it must be said that they are politically savvy. They don't get into those positions of power - in the case of Bloomberg, both economic and political power - by being anybody's fool.","When you are a people's movement, you have one thing. Your only asset is people. And you have to deal with real people. Not the people of your imagination. Not the people you wish people would be. But people as they exist actually out there in the real world.","I voted for Nader, and I have no doubts at all that it was the right thing to do because the Nader candidacy was extremely energising and a terrific phenomenon in American life, and I hope he continues.","Why should Americans go on with their lives as normal, worrying about calories and hair loss, while other people are worrying about where they are going to get their next piece of bread?","I'm an old fan of the Negro spirituals.","I don't claim to know Israel. I don't speak Hebrew; my contacts are pretty limited. But I didn't know Vietnam; I didn't know Nicaragua, El Salvador or Honduras. It doesn't mean you can't reach your conclusions.","I am opposed to any state with an ethnic character, not only to Israel.","No doubt one can, in light of further study and life experience, come to repudiate past convictions.","Conversion and zealotry, just like revelation and apostasy, are flip sides of the same coin, the currency of a political culture having more in common with religion than rational discourse.","I think one of the problems when we discuss the Israel-Palestine conflict is people talk too much in terms of, 'What's your preference?,' like politics is a Chinese menu - I'll take one from column A and two from column B. That's not what politics is about.","I don't want to become a rhetorical speaker. My effectiveness is mastering all of the data and being able to respond.","Israel's pro-American orientation exists not just among Israeli elites but also among the whole population. Come what may in Israel, it's inconceivable that this fundamental orientation will change. Combined with its overwhelming military power, this makes Israel a unique and irreplaceable American asset in the Middle East.","Mainstream Jewish intellectuals became 'pro'-Israel after the June 1967 war when Israel became the U.S.A.' s strategic asset in the Middle East, i.e., when it was safe and reaped benefits. To credit them with ideological conviction is, in my opinion, very naive.","Israel has been a stage on which American Jews have played out their fantasies of toughness - often from Martha's Vineyard.","DePaul's plot to deny me tenure had nothing to do with my faults. In fact, and ironically, it viciously attacked me and destroyed my career because of my virtues. Which, although few in number, they still found threatening.","I was probably unusually close to my parents, so I do what I can now to preserve the integrity of their memory. The Holocaust deserves to be remembered."],"Norman Foster":["Everything we design is a response to the specific climate and culture of a particular place.","As an architect, you design for the present, with an awareness of the past, for a future which is essentially unknown.","I travel continuously, and I see many cities, but there is nowhere like London.","Manhattan, one of the most moneyed spots on the planet, also has one of the greatest concentrations of people in its skyscrapers. It's also, of course, the place where every architect wants to build his tower.","You cannot separate the buildings out from the infrastructure of cites and the mobility of transit.","A life-threatening illness or two certainly gives you an awareness of your own mortality. It heightens your sense of gratitude for things that previously, if you've not taken them for granted, you perhaps never appreciated how precious they were. That's almost a platitude, but one has to state the obvious.","There are those airports which make you feel better, and there are those airports that, when you go there, your heart sinks: you can't wait to get out of there. They both function as airports, but it's the things that you can't measure that make them different.","I love flying; I love aircraft, and you could say I've had a love affair with flight since I was a child. I travel a huge amount. I use airports, and as a pilot, I've flown in and out of airports thousands of times, so really, I have a fairly broad perspective.","Anything that reduces fuel consumption and cuts down on greenhouse gasses is good news.","The most amazing lesson in aerodynamics I ever had was the day I climbed a thermal in a glider at the same time as an eagle. I witnessed, close up, effortlessness and lightness combined with strength, precision and determination.","I was born in 1935, and as far back as I can remember, I was sketching designs. My first subject was an aircraft, which I imagined myself piloting.","There's a snobbery at work in architecture. The subject is too often treated as a fine art, delicately wrapped in mumbo-jumbo. In reality, it's an all-embracing discipline taking in science, art, maths, engineering, climate, nature, politics, economics.","Joseph Bazalgette created a sewer system which he originally sized for London's needs of the time - he then doubled it to anticipate the future beyond. These are the qualities that I admire.","I'm not a creature of habit. I like to find things from unexpected sources.","Since Stonehenge, architects have always been at the cutting edge of technology. And you can't separate technology from the humanistic and spiritual content of a building.","I would never wear anything with a logo. That I really find difficult. It's a frustration that I'll find a nice shirt or something and it's got 50 prints of the logo on it - why do they do this?","The only honourable work my parents knew was blue-collar. But while my father Robert ran a pawnbroker's shop, and my mother was a waitress, I moved into a middle-class world with a level of security they never knew.","I describe the design process as like the tip of the iceberg. What you don't see is the long haul: all the endless auditing and things like that.","Control is the wrong word. The practice is very much about sharing, and, in any creative practice, some individuals, whether partners or directors, are much closer to certain projects than I could ever be.","I tend to move between turtlenecks and shirts and ties. I don't really have a uniform in the sense that some people might.","I think you never stop learning.","Every time I've flown an aircraft, or visited a steelworks, or watched a panel-beater at work, I've learned something new that can be applied to buildings.","Google has already tested robot cars in San Francisco. If they can navigate San Francisco, they can probably manage just about anywhere.","I hope that any expansion of London will learn from the planning examples of some of its most desirable areas such as Chelsea, Notting Hill, Belgravia and Mayfair. All are characterised by high density and a generosity of green spaces. They are all pedestrian-friendly with shops, entertainment, restaurants and pubs within easy walking distance.","I think cars encapsulate the history of innovation and style - it's the other side of the coin of the car being public enemy No.1.","You can find, occasionally, some absolutely fantastic things in hunting shops. I've got one jacket that I just happened across which is a kind of unwashed leather - completely anonymous but absolutely special.","The Italians have long known what makes a livable town or city.","I hope that any expansion of London will learn from the planning examples of some of its most desirable areas such as Chelsea, Notting Hill, Belgravia and Mayfair. All are characterised by high density and a generosity of green spaces.","We now think it hilarious that medieval streets were used as open sewers. Equally, our descendants will say: 'You won't believe this, but people were once allowed to hurl a couple of tons of dangerous metal around smashing into each other.'","Surveys often show people would prefer a detached house with a lawn and driveway to an apartment. I understand this. It's not my place to presume to tell people where they can live. But perhaps that dream will simply not be possible in the future.","When the Great Fire of London destroyed most of the medieval city in 1666, Christopher Wren was invited to design a new one. Within days, he had drawn up an elegant grid of broad boulevards leading to majestic squares, but it came to nothing - the existing landowners wanted things as they had been.","In Britain, the idea one could go from blue-collar beginnings to the university was so far out, it was quite unthinkable. I took a variety of jobs to pay for tuition - from ice-cream salesman to night-club bouncer. Whatever earned the most money in the least time."],"Norman Geisler":["Jesus is the only way because the Bible says it to be true. Why? Because only He can bridge the gap between God and man; there's no other way.","The age of the Earth is a hotly debated issue among evangelicals. Old Earthers believe, like most scientists, that the universe is billions of years old. Young Earthers measure the age of the universe in terms of thousands of years.","All views can't be true because all views are opposite; this is the logical aspect. For example, Islam says we are good in nature; Christianity says we are born in sin. Islam says God is a man; Christianity says He is more than a man, He is God. All truths can't be the same.","Only Jesus has prophecies made hundreds of years in advance made literally true. Only He did miracles; only His immediate followers claimed He died and rose from the dead, so in comparison, He comes out superior to other great religious leaders.","Pluralism is denied logically; inclusivism is denied scripturally, and that leaves us with exclusivism... you have to know that Jesus died and believe in it in order to be saved.","Evangelicals have largely misinterpreted Aquinas, and they have placed on him views that he did not hold.","Even Martin Luther and John Calvin believed that the Roman Catholic church, up to the Council of Trent, was basically orthodox - a true church with sound fundamental doctrines as well as significant error.","Aquinas is worth reading. He has stood the test of time. And even where he errs, you can learn more from the errors of a great mind than you can learn from the truths of a small mind. You can see a whole lot farther standing on the shoulders of giants.","I can't tell you how Aquinas has enriched and changed my life, my thought. He has helped me to be a better evangelical, a better servant of Christ, and to better defend the faith that was delivered, once for all, to the saints.","For some, the belief in a Young Earth seems to be based on a kind of intuition or faith in what they believe an omnipotent God should do. It reasons that if God is all powerful, then certainly He would not have taken millions of years to make the earth.","One should never tie his faith to how old the earth is."],"Norman Granz":["As long as we're in a democracy, I have to give what I think the majority of people will enjoy.","Ellington is a writer and arranger, as well as a musician and leader. He does movie sound tracks.","For years, Jazz At The Philharmonic albums were the only ones of their kind.","I allowed artists to play for as long as they felt they could justifiably continue to create.","I don't know who's 18 years old today that, 20 years hence, is going to be a jazz fan.","I don't think I will ever do any tours again in the United States. I rather think that that's over with.","I don't think that jazz, as any kind of an art form, has any permanence attached to it, apart from the practitioners of it.","I don't want to sound as if I'm doing something tremendously special. But I am a jazz fan.","I find myself more at peace when I live in Europe.","I still continue to do at least four concert tours a year, and in many cases, as many as six.","I'm concerned with trend. I don't know where jazz fans will come from 20 years from now.","I'm talking as a professional impresario. I'm not judging anybody at all.","If I were to put on Barbra Streisand and Duke Ellington, one might say the combination isn't good.","If you look at my audiences, even in Europe, they're hardly teenagers.","In 1958, I decided that I was going to live in Europe permanently. So in 1959 I moved to Lugano, Switzerland.","Jazz was uplifted by what I did.","My function at Verve was that of a genuine producer in artists and repertoire.","My juices needed restoring. I needed a sabbatical from the record business.","Sponsors and networks will really go all out and simply evaluate people on the basis of talent.","The history of all big jazz bands shows was, first they played for dancing, and then they played for singing.","The public, hearing pop music, is, without knowing it, also soaking up jazz.","The record companies are interested in the kind of sales they can get from the rock groups.","When I was doing jazz concerts in America, I would use the biggest names I could find.","You will always find a few people in any area that would like things done completely their way.","Ella can work nightclubs that Duke might not be able to work, because of having the big band. Where they go now is strictly a matter of their own names and talents.","Germany is probably the richest country in Western Europe. Yet they wouldn't take any television with Duke and Ella, their reaction being that people weren't interested in it.","I don't say that the supposed Civil Rights development is a myth, but it's a matter of dealing with reality. It's purely peripheral and, in many cases, it's just a facade.","The economic picture in the States today doesn't allow for jazz concerts in a tour fashion. People now are too used to the Festival, which gives them more names for the same price.","There are many artists that I present that I admit I like less than I do others. But I think that they warrant being presented by my own, personal standards.","There are very few groups that really stay together. The leaders of groups make enough money to be able to afford to work a maximum of 35-40 weeks a year.","To play today in London, next week in Madrid and the week after that in Warsaw is a bit better than playing Newark and Baltimore and Philadelphia. I've been doing that for 20 years.","Amsterdam must have more than a million people. But the only area where jazz is really profitable and successful in an economic sense is in Japan. That's because they haven't been exposed enough.","I made it easier for many artists to play in certain areas."],"Norman Jewison":["I was very disappointed that Denzel didn't win Best Actor for The Hurricane because I thought he deserved it.","Look, I'm just a storyteller. When I make a film, I never want the film to become a vehicle of social propaganda.","And I think all Nazis didn't see themselves as bad people. I've never met a racist yet who thought he was a racist. Or an anti-Semite who thought they were anti-Semitic.","When I make a film, I never want the film to become a vehicle of social propaganda. If I wanted to do that, I'd make documentaries.","We also have a tendency to root for the fugitive. We're always on the side of the animal being chased.","I'm going to do an adaptation of the Italian film, Bread and Tulips. I really like that film.","When you shoot a musical, you're shooting to lipsynch tracks, so we had to figure out our choreography and work out what we wanted to do with each number before we did it.","I think all Nazis didn't see themselves as bad people. I've never met a racist yet who thought he was a racist. Or an anti-Semite who thought they were anti-Semitic.","Betrayal... is my favorite subject.","We're always on the side of the animal that's being chased. We always seem to be on the side of the rabbit or the fox and not on the side of the hounds.","I work with a lot of movie stars.","Michael Caine is a movie star, but he's also a great actor. I can't say that about every movie star. It's the concentration he has.","A lot of American actors I work with are in character all day long. You can't talk to them. It's Method and the whole thing.","With most British actors, it's amazing. I think they start with the character on the outside and work in.","Do what you're told, and everything will be all right.","I'm just a storyteller.","I don't make films to win prizes. I make films to make films.","I'm in the mood for another Moonstruck experience, for another romantic comedy.","I was really excited to have the opportunity to make Fiddler.","Everything Sholom Aleichem talks about in his plays and his short stories is about people, family, man's relationship with his God, the breaking down of tradition.","In America there's no rights for the artist, so whatever films I've made kind of belong to the studio.","I think you get better as you get older.","Moonstruck... was one of the few romantic comedies to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.","I think I've done pretty well. I've had about 46, or 47 nominations from my movies, and my films have won about 12 awards, so I don't have any complaints.","Well, you know the old line - to be nominated is what it's all about. I think that I've done pretty well - I've had about 46, or 47 nominations from my movies, and my films have won about 12 awards in total, so I don't really have any complaints.","It's an entire industry focusing on young male viewers that want action and violence. They sell us something that isn't valid. They're selling films like a product.","I still get a lot of material but I find that as one gets older you get more fussy. You know you're going spend a year or a year and a half on this and you know there are only so many films in you so you get a little bit more selective.","I mean they're making remakes of my films and I'm not even dead yet! Why would you want to make a remake?","I don't like to think that maybe I'm just getting old. I'm not too excited about watching a huge explosion. I'm more interested in people and characters.","Every generation deals with the breaking down of its tradition, and I think that they rediscovered the film.","But Madonna has a small amount of talent when it comes to movies.","As you know, in America there's no rights for the artist, so whatever films I've made kind of belong to the studio, so if they want to remake it they can.","And even Moonstruck - for some reason the audience were just in the mood for a very romantic film, because it's one of the few romantic comedies to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar."],"Norman Lamm":["Conventional dogmas, even if endowed with the authority of an Aristotle - ancient or modern - must be tested vigorously. If they are found wanting, we need not bother with them. But if they are found to be substantially correct, we may not overlook them.","No religious position is loyally served by refusing to consider annoying theories which may well turn out to be facts.","I was not the midwife of the Law School, but its fraternal twin.","However, the word madda in modern Hebrew specifically means science.","My mother, whose family was heavily rabbinic, said she wanted me to continue the family tradition in the rabbinate. My father said he wanted me to be a scholar of the Talmud, but he wanted me to make my living in science.","In Judaism, there are 613 biblical commandments, and the Talmud says that the chief commandment of all is study.","Judaism is an intellectually based religion, and the single most important theme is that of study.","At Cardozo, study of law is part of a larger culture. You can get a law degree and make a good living, but it is best that you do that having studied the discipline for its own inherent merit, because you love studying.","I showed that privacy was an implicit right in Jewish law, probably going back to the second or third century, when it was elaborated on in a legal way.","As a result of this article, I was invited to testify in the Senate Judiciary Committee on privacy law.","I think our vision heretofore has been and should continue to be to have Cardozo be the kind of law school that we can be proud of. I would like to see it gain recognition as one of the three best law schools in New York City.","Maimonides taught that it is better that 10 criminals go free than let one innocent man be executed. The Innocence Project represents that point of view.","Modern Orthodoxy has a highly positive attitude toward the State of Israel. Our Ultra-Orthodox brethren recognize only the Holy Land, but not the state.","Most Modern Orthodox are religious Zionists. Despite all differences and nuances among us, we consider the founding of the State a historic change. We accept it as something that came from Providence.","Not all Modern Orthodox Jews, at the present juncture, identify with what the Israeli government does. In Israel many religious Zionists strongly oppose the government because of the disengagement.","I was critical of the Israeli government, however, for not being prepared for the move. One does not uproot thousands of people without planning in advance what will be done with them. This was a political and human error in which the government functioned poorly.","As far as YU faculty and students are concerned, the love for Israel is very strong. Probably about three thousand of our graduates have settled in Israel. On average, every year 650 male and female students study in Israel for a minimum of one year.","Most students have thoughts about emigrating to Israel. A significant number go on aliyah. We are proud of our Israel programs, which come at a considerable cost to the university."],"Norman Lear":["Life is about having a good time, and it was a good time. We did some things well and some things poorly, but that was always the case.","Life is made up of small pleasures. Happiness is made up of those tiny successes. The big ones come too infrequently. And if you don't collect all these tiny successes, the big ones don't really mean anything.","That's the heart of it: My shows were not that controversial with the American people. They were controversial with the people who think for the American people.","Maybe they continued to agree with Archie Bunker - as I said earlier, you can't change people's minds, but you can get them to think.","We did an episode on Good Times which came out of a newspaper article about the incidence of hypertension in black males being higher than whites, and increasing. So we did a show in which James, the father on Good Times, had hypertension.","I stop and look at traffic accidents. I won't hang around, but when I hear something is terrible, as bad as it is, I've gotta look at it.","There was no real controversy with All In The Family. That came from the people on the business end.","When we went on the air, I didn't want to be interrupted for an act-one curtain.","I wanted to just do a one-act play for 26 minutes, with commercials at the beginning and end. For years, I couldn't get my way. They wanted to interrupt three times.","We got ratings. It isn't that they won't quarrel with you, or say you're always right. But as long as you stay strong and the ratings are good and you're reasonable - I don't think we fought unreasonably. We basically won that right.","Originally, with all the shows, we went looking for belly laughs.","It crossed our minds early on that the more an audience cared - we were working before, on average, 240, live people. If you could get them caring - the more they cared, the harder they laughed.","So we gravitated to shows and issues and causes that made people care.","We are a country of excess. So it's not the violence, per se, but the exacerbation and constant repetition.","TV that people will never see, that giant international corporations will never touch, will never pay your salary.","You're in the business - when you're a writer, producer, director - to get ratings.","At great, great remove sit the head of General Electric, the head of News Corp, the head of Viacom, or the head of this giant international corporation that wants these ratings.","Granted, the writers, directors, producers, and that community make a great deal of money. But they might be choosing to do a whole lot of other things for the living they make.","I think the greater responsibility, in terms of morality, is where leadership begins.","In the area we're discussing, leadership begins on Madison Avenue, on the desks and in the offices of people who spend hundreds of millions of dollars buying what will get them ratings.","In this nation, leadership is dollars.","But it also became the experience, or was the experience, of the writers who were attracted to this kind of humor. They're all men or women who come from the same kind of experience in their own lives.","But you know, my dad called me the laziest white kid he ever met. When I screamed back at him that he was putting down a race of people to call me lazy, his answer was that's not what he was doing, and that I was also the dumbest white kid he ever met.","The American people may not be the best-educated, but they're very wise at heart.","Even when they don't know who Nixon was, these shows will continue to play.","Life goes on pretty much the same way. I've been working on a couple of films on the side. You may see some more. You may even see another television show.","I guess because the shows were activist in their own way - the marriage of my public activism and my career activism, you know - people understand me very well. They also understand there's a very strong bipartisan part in all of this.","Nobody doubts my partisanship, but a lot of the activity is nonpartisan."],"Norman Lindsay":["The best love affairs are those we never had.","Every mind which has given itself to self-expression in art is aware of a directing agency outside its conscious control which it has agreed to label 'inspiration'.","Sex is not only the basis of life, it is the reason for life.","A writer who presents men and women as creatures truncated below the waist is exposed as one who goes about without his trousers saying, 'see, I have had my testicles removed.'"],"Norman Lloyd":["I was in my second year at NYU. I knew what I wanted to do, and I just walked out of college. So, from the age of 17, I've been able to do what I wanted, and that makes for a kind of contentment, a fairly pleasant demeanor.","I eat meat, poultry and fish in proper proportion - nothing to excess.","The Depression was remarkable because you had nothing, and the salaries, when you got a job, were very small. But you could do anything. You see, a donut was ten cents. A cup of coffee was a nickel. That was lunch, with an apple. And I would be playing a lead on a Broadway show on that kind of diet.","You know I've never worked without a script before, but with Apatow, it's all improvisation. He calls out a premise, and you have to adapt.","I always felt it was necessary to keep up some kind of communication with other people.","I'm a pure spirit, ha ha ha!","I used to watch Babe Ruth for 50 cents. Now, baseball tickets are $400!","I loved 'Modern Family!' It was sort of the precursor to 'Trainwreck,' to that character. But I loved it. I had a great time doing it.","I was clearly brought into the whole thing about acting by my mother. She loved the theater. She had a very pleasant singing voice, which she used to sing for her ladies' club.","Karl Malden! A dear, dear, dear friend. I loved Karl. He was great.","I loved working with Renoir on 'The Southerner.' Oh, I loved it! I particularly loved when he had a scene with a cow going through a garden, and he wanted a little dog to come and bark at it and chase it out.","As far as 'St. Elsewhere' goes, I just loved that show.","I'm very fond of Amy Schumer. I think she's terrific, an enormous talent.","Peter Weir is remarkable. He can do anything.","I'm very proud of the people with whom I've worked. It's an amazing collection that just by happenstance happened.","There were little Charlie Chaplins that you would wind up, and they would walk. I remember vividly. I was sitting in the high chair with the little tray in front of me. My parents would wind it up, and it would walk to me.","I imagine I was supposed to become a lawyer or something. But this was the Depression; the lawyers I saw were all driving cabs. So I thought, 'Well, if I'm going to be badly off anyway, I might as well be badly off in the theater, where you get used to it.'","I very much admired Lancaster. George Clooney reminds me of him today. Not all the macho, swinging around that Burt used to do, but the courage. You know where you stand with men like that.","Some of the movies I did - well, you have to feed your family.","Connie Bennett, the guys used to stake her, she was so good.","When I think back on it, it's amazing what happens to us as we move out into the world.","My family were Conservative Jews. My parents were both born in this country, but my father grew up on the Lower East Side, and my mother was born and raised in Harlem when there was a large Jewish 'colony' there. Eventually, they moved to Jersey City to get away from New York.","The Jews are an artistic people. It's clear from the music, the actors, the writers. They are just artists. In the early part of the 20th century, when they first came over, they had no money, but they still went to theater. The theater and education were the two biggest things in their lives.","If you're in the groove, you get something back from the audience that is so exciting and rewarding that no film or television work can possibly compete.","There's a conflict between what's in your mind and what's in your body.","I was playing good tennis up until 100.","I move slowly, and I used to move fast. I miss that.","You were taught how to do the things you needed to do. Dance, speech, fencing. They groomed people. If you were in a film, and the script wasn't working for you, they brought in screenwriters and fixed the scripts.","Everyone's looking for who's hot. What about looking for who's good?","Renoir had a strong feeling about his fellow soldiers. He'd never disrespect them by putting the war down.","I have never had a better working experience than 'St. Elsewhere.' It's a supreme show.","Actors are, in a sense, like athletes. They've got to stretch once in a while.","An actor can grow stale in a bad part. Actors grow stale, generally, because there's no demand on them.","People get ideas of how to live or not to live from what you do on television.","I watch the Dodgers every night - no reading anymore - and I dream that I could have hit that home run.","With Hitchcock, you work with a script, and you stick to it.","We in New York were very poor in the depths of the Depression - but I must say, that was the best time of my life.","I think Obama is going to go down as one of our greatest presidents because what this guy has done and has tried to do, and over the kind of opposition that I don't know if Lincoln had, except he had to go to war. This speaks so brilliantly of Obama and the way he conducts himself. I think he is already one of our greatest presidents.","If I go to England, they know I'm not an Englishman, but most Americans think I'm English.","The writing was vastly superior to almost anything that was on the air. It's one of the great shows. It was an important show... 'St. Elsewhere' was one of the great shows in the history of television.","I think if you allow yourself to mope and feel sorry for yourself, it can take years off your life.","You must be active; you must be positive, even if things don't go the way you want them to.","I don't eat shellfish. I drink wine moderately and have one whiskey every evening before dinner.","Truly great performers reveal not only their characters but bring everything they know about the world with them. It's not just what's in the script but the story of everything you've done and of who you are. If you're Chaplin, you're the immigrant. No matter what he's doing, he's always the little guy trying to make his place in the world.","I knew a lot of people who were beaten by the Depression, but there was still a feeling of positiveness among people: everyone thought it's got to get better. We were all trying to get the country back on its feet. There was a feeling that you could do anything, and this was certainly very true in the theater.","When you're 26, you can do anything."],"Norman MacCaig":["I'm very gregarious, but I love being in the hills on my own.","When I go fishing I like to know that there's nobody within five miles of me.","I said I have no powers of invention. Well, I also have no powers of mimicry.","I used to fish the Border rivers, but nowadays you have to queue up for a shot and I can't stand that.","There are some friends you don't meet for twenty years and when you meet them again it's as if no twenty years has happened - you're lucky when that happens. I feel the same about books.","A terrible thing about getting oldish is that your friends start dying, and in the last ten years I have lost seven or eight of my closest.","All I write about is what's happened to me and to people I know, and the better I know them, the more likely they are to be written about.","All those authors there, most of whom of course I've never met. That's the poetry side, that's the prose side, that's the fishing and miscellaneous behind me. You get an affection for books that you've enjoyed.","And if they haven't got poetry in them, there's nothing you can do that will produce it.","And in a way, that's been a help to me, because I take great passions for a particular poet - sometimes it lasts for many years, sometimes only for a while. This happens to everybody.","And it's impossible for me to read Henry James.","And some poets are far better read off the page because they're very bad speakers. I'm thinking of one in particular whom I won't name, a good poet, and he reads in such a dry, boring way, your eyes start drooping.","And the second question, can poetry be taught? I didn't think so.","Anybody who writes doesn't like to be misunderstood.","But I hang on to books. I love them. I even think they're very nice decor in a room - far better than paintings... That's not quite true!","But you'd have a job to find many of my poems which would seem to be very influenced by a particular person.","However, I learned something. I thought that if the young person, the student, has poetry in him or her, to offer them help is like offering a propeller to a bird.","I don't care whether a book is a first edition or not. I'm not a bibliophile in that word's natural sense.","I don't think of myself all the time.","I find it's impossible for me to read Proust.","I never think about poetry except when I'm writing it. I mean my poetry.","I only keep books that I like very much. Otherwise I'd throw them out.","I used to have a great love for Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, the big boys of the last century.","I was very interested in American poetry for many years. Much less now.","If I wrote a play with four characters every single one of them would talk like me regardless of age or sex.","In fact a lot of them I think are absolute baloney. Those Charles Olsens and people like that. At first I was interested in seeing what they were up to, what they were doing, why they were doing it. They never moved me in the way that one is moved by true poetry.","It's like breathing in and out to me. It's like having a conversation with someone who isn't there. Because it has to be addressed to somebody - not a particular person, or very rarely.","People haven't got the interest in long long works these days. A lack of interest which I share.","Well, I love fishing. I wouldn't kill a fly myself but I've no hesitation in killing a fish. A lot of men are like that. No bother. Out you come. Thump. And that's not the only reason.","Well, I'm a light traveller. I chuck things away.","When I talk of hearing a poet's voice speaking, I always think of it as in the presence of the man.","When I was a teacher, teachers would come into my classroom and admire my desk on which lay nothing whatever, whereas theirs were heaped with papers and books.","When I was asked to be Writer in Residence at Edinburgh I thought, you can't teach poetry. This is ridiculous."],"Norman Maclean":["At sunrise everything is luminous but not clear. It is those we live with and love and should know who elude us. You can love completely without complete understanding.","Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it."],"Norman Macleod":["As adults feign disinterest in science - children can grab hold of it to distinguish themselves.","Palaeontologists use fiction all the time.","Writing a children's book means you cannot spin out long narratives or have complex character development."],"Norman Mailer":["The highest prize in a world of men is the most beautiful woman available on your arm and living there in her heart loyal to you.","Masculinity is not something given to you, but something you gain. And you gain it by winning small battles with honor.","Hip is the sophistication of the wise primitive in a giant jungle.","I'm hostile to men, I'm hostile to women, I'm hostile to cats, to poor cockroaches, I'm afraid of horses.","The difference between writing a book and being on television is the difference between conceiving a child and having a baby made in a test tube.","The function of socialism is to raise suffering to a higher level.","Ultimately a hero is a man who would argue with the gods, and so awakens devils to contest his vision. The more a man can achieve, the more he may be certain that the devil will inhabit a part of his creation.","Obsession is the single most wasteful human activity, because with an obsession you keep coming back and back and back to the same question and never get an answer.","If a person is not talented enough to be a novelist, not smart enough to be a lawyer, and his hands are too shaky to perform operations, he becomes a journalist.","I don't think life is absurd. I think we are all here for a huge purpose. I think we shrink from the immensity of the purpose we are here for.","Every moment of one's existence one is growing into more or retreating into less. One is always living a little more or dying a little bit.","It's not the sentiments of men which make history but their actions.","There was that law of life, so cruel and so just, that one must grow or else pay more for remaining the same.","Because there is very little honor left in American life, there is a certain built-in tendency to destroy masculinity in American men.","There are four stages in a marriage. First there's the affair, then the marriage, then children and finally the fourth stage, without which you cannot know a woman, the divorce.","Alimony is the curse of the writing class.","Sentimentality is the emotional promiscuity of those who have no sentiment.","Once a newspaper touches a story, the facts are lost forever, even to the protagonists.","Culture's worth huge, huge risks. Without culture we're all totalitarian beasts.","It's not a good idea to put your wife into a novel; not your latest wife anyway.","The final purpose of art is to intensify, even, if necessary, to exacerbate, the moral consciousness of people.","I hate everything which is not in myself.","I had a quick grasp of the secret to sanity, it had become the ability to hold the maximum of impossible combinations in one's mind.","America is a hurricane, and the only people who do not hear the sound are those fortunate if incredibly stupid and smug White Protestants who live in the center, in the serene eye of the big wind.","With the pride of the artist, you must blow against the walls of every power that exists the small trumpet of your defiance.","When I read it, I don't wince, which is all I ever ask for a book I write.","Tough guys don't dance. You had better believe it.","Giving a camera to Diane Arbus is like putting a live grenade in the hands of a child.","Each day a few more lies eat into the seed with which we are born, little institutional lies from the print of newspapers, the shock waves of television, and the sentimental cheats of the movie screen.","There is nothing safe about sex. There never will be.","The horror of the Twentieth Century was the size of each new event, and the paucity of its reverberation.","In America all too few blows are struck into flesh. We kill the spirit here, we are experts at that. We use psychic bullets and kill each other cell by cell.","I think it's bad to talk about one's present work, for it spoils something at the root of the creative act. It discharges the tension.","A modern democracy is a tyranny whose borders are undefined; one discovers how far one can go only by traveling in a straight line until one is stopped.","Writing books is the closest men ever come to childbearing.","In America few people will trust you unless you are irreverent.","Growth, in some curious way, I suspect, depends on being always in motion just a little bit, one way or another.","Revolutions are the periods of history when individuals count most.","The Irish are the only men who know how to cry for the dirty polluted blood of all the world.","The natural role of twentieth-century man is anxiety.","What characterizes a member of a minority group is that he is forced to see himself as both exceptional and insignificant, marvelous and awful, good and evil.","God like Us suffers the ambition to make a destiny more extraordinary than was conceived for Him, yes God is like Me, only more so.","We can never know for certain where our prayers are likely to go, nor from whom the answers will come. Just when we think we are at our nearest to God, we could be assisting the Devil."],"Norman McLaren":["Animation is not the art of drawings that move but the art of movements that are drawn.","Film is changing, and it can't help but keep changing.","The process of art evolving is always one which has fascinated me.","I like black and white films. I don't exactly know why - probably because there is a stylization which is removed from actual life, unlike a color film.","The good moral work of art should have all the qualities that a good amoral work of art should have, such as formal unity, balance, contrast, and a sensitivity to the material out of which it is made.","But it has, in addition, an even more precious quality - a consciousness of the human intelligence, the human spirit and that man is a social creature.","I have tried to preserve in my relationship to the film the same closeness and intimacy that exists between a painter and his canvas.","And so my militant philosophy is this: to make with a brush on canvas is a simple direct delight-to make with the movie is the same.","By drawing or exposing two or more patterns on the same bit of film I can create harmony and textual effects.","The number of strokes to the inch controls the pitch of the note: the more, the higher the pitch; the fewer, the lower the pitch, the size of the stroke controls the loudness... the tone quality is the most difficult element to control, it is made by the shape of the strokes.","Well rounded forms gives smooth sounds; sharper or angular forms give harder and harsher sounds.","In any art movement, the art has to move into a new phase - a filmmaker has a desire to make a film that is not like a previous film.","I don't know whether it ever comes back to the same thing; it does return to the spirit of a previous period in some way, but it's different, it's new.","Take a film of Jacques Tati like Mon Oncle which has something quite new - for me, unique - in it.","So people will come along and do new things and sometimes return to the spirit of an earlier age.","Unless it's done superbly, as in the Japanese film Gate of Hell, color can be a very distracting element."],"Norman O.

Personality is the original personal property.","The dynamics of capitalism is postponement of enjoyment to the constantly postponed future.","Freedom is poetry, taking liberties with words, breaking the rules of normal speech, violating common sense.

They are looking for an ideological crusade. Traditions don't matter.","Conservatives want smaller government. They want to focus on market-based solutions wherever one can. They want to have as little regulation as possible. But in general, they recognize that government must play an important role for a society to operate.","Government is inevitably going to play a very significant role in infrastructure, and in a country with a federal system where vibrancy and economic health depend on interstate commerce, it's not going to be private enterprise or state governments that will give you things like an interstate highway system.","The best way to get your audience larger and more consistent is to be more divisive and more radical and criticize those who cater to or kowtow to other forces."],"Norman Parkinson":["A photographer without a magazine behind him is like a farmer without fields.","The camera can be the most deadly weapon since the assassin's bullet.

Maybe a mullet would've thrown me over the edge.","I followed a girl I met in Japan to Los Angeles and ended up working in a motorcycle store.

The first night, there was an agent in the audience who took me on and sent me out for jobs.","I'm constantly running away from everything. I'm running away from things on a daily basis. I run away from relationships. I run away from responsibilities.","I don't think anyone wants to cuddle a zombie.","I'm more of a listener than a talker.","Damaged people gravitate towards damaged people.","I've shot films in locations that have seemed haunted.

I'm just trying to stay lean and active looking.","I'm one of those people who can watch a stupid movie and end up crying.","I went camping one time when I was twelve, to the Great Lakes. My friend stepped in really deep muddy water and started screaming and sinking. My mom ran up, and I was just standing there a foot away and wouldn't stick out my hand to pull him up. So I'm probably not the best person to take on a camping trip.","I've been into Sonic Youth since junior high school. I think I kind of have ADD, so it's good music for ADD because it just throws you in different directions all the time. I really like Kim Gordon's voice and Thurston Moore's voice, and I like the guitars going off on tangents.","I've been a huge Psychedelic Furs fan for a long time. I love Butler's paintings, too.

It was close to home and it made me realise acting wasn't just making faces for the cameras, it was a real art form.","I have a cartoon I'm developing with Adult Swim called 'Monster Town U.S.A.,' so I'm busy doing that. Trying to do a coffee-table book of my photography that's been requested of me a couple of times. I'm constantly busy.","I had fears going into television that it might become boring to me, and I always like to be challenged, push myself.

I think my favorite movie growing up was 'The Omen.' I actually wanted to be that little kid.","I've had shows as a painter, as a photographer, I've done shows as a sculptor.

So, you see, they're always looking ahead to something new and exciting. The secret is not to look back.","I talk as I sketch, too, in order to keep their minds off what I'm doing so I'll get the most natural expression I can from them. Also, the talking helps to size up the subject's personality, so I can figure out better how to portray him.","Some people have been kind enough to call me a fine artist. I've always called myself an illustrator. I'm not sure what the difference is. All I know is that whatever type of work I do, I try to give it my very best. Art has been my life.","I'll never have enough time to paint all the pictures I'd like to.","I'm the oldest antique in town.","Right from the beginning, I always strived to capture everything I saw as completely as possible.","When I go to farms or little towns, I am always surprised at the discontent I find. And New York, too often, has looked across the sea toward Europe. And all of us who turn our eyes away from what we have are missing life.","Eisenhower had about the most expressive face I ever painted, I guess. Just like an actor's. Very mobile. When he talked, he used all the facial muscles. And he had a great, wide mouth that I liked. When he smiled, it was just like the sun came out.","Everyone in those days expected that art students were wild, licentious characters. We didn't know how to be, but we sure were anxious to learn.","I'm tired, but proud.","The '20s ended in an era of extravagance, sort of like the one we're in now. There was a big crash, but then the country picked itself up again, and we had some great years. Those were the days when American believed in itself. I was happy and proud to be painting it.","My best efforts were some modern things that looked like very lousy Matisses. Thank God I had the sense to realize they were lousy, and leave Paris.","Very interesting for an old duffer like me to try his hand at something new. If I don't do that once in a while, I might just turn into a fossil, you know!","Some folks think I painted Lincoln from life, but I haven't been around that long. Not quite.","I learned to draw everything except glamorous women. No matter how much I tried to make them look sexy, they always ended up looking silly... or like somebody's mother.","Things aren't much wilder now, I don't think, than they were back then. Of course I just read about all the goings-on now. Ha.","I didn't know what to expect from a famous movie star; maybe that he'd be sort of stuck-up, you know. But not Gary Cooper. He horsed around so much... that I had a hard time painting him.","A face in the picture would bother me, so I'd rub it out with the turpentine and do it over.","Here in New England, the character is strong and unshakable.","The remarks about my reaching the age of Social Security and coming to the end of the road, they jolted me. And that was good. Because I sure as hell had no intention of just sitting around for the rest of my life. So I'd whip out the paints and really go to it.","I can take a lot of pats on the back. I love it when I get admiring letters from people. And, of course, I'd love it if the critics would notice me, too.","You must first spend some time getting your model to relax. Then you'll get a natural expression.","I'm not going to be caught around here for any fool celebration. To hell with birthdays!","No man with a conscience can just bat out illustrations. He's got to put all his talent and feeling into them!","It was a pretty rough neighborhood where I grew up The really tough places were over around Third Avenue where it ran into the Harlem River, but we weren't far away.","I had a couple of million dollars' worth of... stock once.

I guess I just wasn't born to be rich.","It wouldn't be right for me to clown around when I'm painting a president."],"Norman Schwarzkopf":["The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war.","Going to war without France is like going hunting without an accordion.","As young West Point cadets, our motto was 'duty, honor, country.' But it was in the field, from the rice paddies of Southeast Asia to the sands of the Middle East, that I learned that motto's fullest meaning. There I saw gallant young Americans of every race, creed and background fight, and sometimes die, for 'duty, honor, and their country.'","The fun of fishing is catching 'em, not killing 'em.","It doesn't take a hero to order men into battle. It takes a hero to be one of those men who goes into battle.","It takes a hero to be one of those men who goes into battle.","You learn far more from negative leadership than from positive leadership. Because you learn how not to do it. And, therefore, you learn how to do it.","I can stand in a crystal stream without another human around me and cast all day long, and if I never catch a single fish, I can come home and still feel like I had a wonderful time. It's the being there that's important.","Leadership is a potent combination of strategy and character. But if you must be without one, be without the strategy.","I do hunt, and I do fish, and I don't apologize to anybody for hunting and fishing.","It's nice to feel that you have a purpose.","All you have to do is hold your first soldier who is dying in your arms, and have that terribly futile feeling that I can't do anything about it... Then you understand the horror of war.","The truth of the matter is that you always know the right thing to do. The hard part is doing it.","Any soldier worth his salt should be antiwar. And still there are things worth fighting for.","I'm not a type-B personality who knows I have a cancer growing inside of me and can live with the knowledge. I go into a kung-fu attack position when I go through the door of a hospital.","You can't help but... with 20/20 hindsight, go back and say, 'Look, had we done something different, we probably wouldn't be facing what we are facing today.'","A great deal of the capability of an army is its dedication to its cause and its will to fight. You can have the best equipment in the world, you can have the largest numbers in the world, but, if you're not dedicated to your cause, if you don't have the will to fight, then, you are not going to have a very good army.","The Patriot missile is a point defence missile. Point defence means that you put the missile at a location to defend a very specific target such as an airfield, a supply dump or a headquarters.","He is neither a strategist nor is he schooled in the operational arts, nor is he a tactician, nor is he a general. Other than that he's a great military man.","They say the good Lord doesn't charge you for the days you hunt and fish, and I believe that.","Unfortunately, if you've ever been in southern Georgia on the beaches in a lightning storm, if you're out there, you're in great, great danger, and you can be killed very, very quickly.","When the Normandy Invasion was planned, a very specific strategic objective was given, and that strategic objective was the basis upon which the plan for the Normandy Invasion was derived.","I am living proof that if you catch prostate cancer early, it can be reduced to a temporary inconvenience, and you can go back to a normal life.","What people don't understand is this is something that we only have in America. There is no other country in the world where the ordinary citizen can go out and enjoy hunting and fishing. There's no other nation in the world where that happens. And it's very much a part of our heritage.","True courage is being afraid, and going ahead and doing your job anyhow, that's what courage is.","To be an effective leader, you have to have a manipulative streak - you have to figure out the people working for you and give each tasks that will take advantage of his strength.","When placed in command, take charge.","Tanks being deployed far forward is an indication of offensive action; tanks in depth is an indication of defensive action.","Good generalship is a realization that... you've got to try and figure out how to accomplish your mission with a minimum loss of human life.","Nobody can ever pin you down when you speculate.","Particularly when you're dealing with very high ranking people, you know, you have to get their attention, they are used to, by their rank, of having their own way and doing their own thing and when it's necessary to all work together on something, sometimes you have to hit the mule between the eyes with a two by four to get its attention.","I can't even begin to visualize myself as a five-star general... When I think of the people who are five-star generals, I can't even see myself standing in their shadow.","I think any student of military strategy would tell you that in order to attack a position, you should have a ratio of approximately 3 to 1 in favor of the attacker.","I get angry at a principle, not a person.","What is postwar Iraq going to look like, with the Kurds and the Sunnis and the Shiites? That's a huge question, to my mind.","I prided myself on being unflappable even in the most chaotic of circumstances.","An awful lot has been written about my temper.","I do not want to be a pawn in a political campaign.","I'd like to think I'm a caring human being.","I am an environmentalist, but I'm not a wacko environmentalist. I believe that mankind and nature can live side-by-side for the mutual benefit of both.","War's a profanity because, let's face it, you've got two opposing sides trying to settle their differences by killing as many of each other as they can.","But I would defy anyone to go back over the years and tell me anyone whose career I've ruined, anyone whom I've driven out of the service, anyone I've fired from a job.","This gulf war syndrome thing is truly unfortunate, and I've met some of the vets who have this. These are my guys, and I feel terrible about it.","With a chemical alarm, you're going to build one that is oversensitive because you would rather the alarm go off and give you a false alarm than to err on the other side.","I'm not proud of killing, of being responsible for the death of a single person. I never will be.","As far as Saddam Hussein being a great military strategist, he is neither a strategist, nor is he schooled in the operational arts, nor is he a tactician, nor is he a general, nor is he a soldier. Other than that, he's a great military man, I want you to know that.","I've managed to convince my wife that somewhere in the Bible it says, 'Man cannot have too many shotguns and fishing poles.'","I may have made my reputation as a general in the Army, and I'm very proud of that. But I've always felt that I was more than one-dimensional. I'd like to think I'm a caring human being.","Well, unfortunately, I have always regretted the fact that I have a temper, but I also have, you know, have great love and respect for all of the people that have worked for me. I think like everything else, this is one of those things that has been blown out of proportion.","For the entire first part of my career, I prided myself on being unflappable even in the most chaotic of circumstances.","Generals aren't in the business of commenting on the correctness or incorrectness of the President's decisions. Anybody who thinks he should be able to do that ought to be fired on the spot.","War is a profane thing.","A professional soldier understands that war means killing people, war means maiming people, war means families left without fathers and mothers.","I hate war. Absolutely, I hate war.","Had the United States and the United Kingdom gone on alone to capture Baghdad, under the provisions of the Geneva and Hague conventions we would have been considered occupying powers and therefore would have been responsible for all the costs of maintaining or restoring government, education and other services for the people of Iraq.","Had we taken all of Iraq, we would have been like a dinosaur in the tar pit - we would still be there, and we, not the United Nations, would be bearing the costs of that occupation.","First of all, Saddam did not win the war, even though he says he did, I mean, you know, that's a joke and everybody in the world knows it.","If Saddam were to be replaced tomorrow he would probably be replaced with someone who's just as bad or worse than he is.","I may have made my reputation as a general in the Army and I'm very proud of that. But I've always felt that I was more than one-dimensional.","If it had been our intention to take Iraq, if it had been our intention to destroy the country, if it had been our intention to overrun the country, we could have done it unopposed.","I'm not a politician. I'd make a lousy politician.","I like to say I'm not a hero.","I was lucky enough to lead a very successful war.","Good generalship is the realisation that you've got to figure out how to accomplish your mission with the minimum loss of human life.","I am not one of these guys who is just going to waste American lives by throwing people needlessly in frontal attacks up against the enemy if I can avoid doing that.","Fish are a renewable resource, and one of the problems we've had is people feel obliged to catch the limit, then throw 'em in the garbage can.","When I fish, I stop thinking about anything else. But truth be told, if you want to declare victories, I can tell you the fish have won a lot more than I have. It's interesting that something with a brain the size of a fish's can outsmart us humans, who think we are el supremo.","Moving into an unoccupied village when there's no opposition, I don't call that a military victory.","There's no doubt in my mind that whichever commander ordered the blowing up of Kamisiyah did so in following the instructions that he had received.","I saw Kuwait many times before the war. I remember it as a beautiful place, full of very nice people, and it's a tragedy to see that somebody could set out to deliberately destroy a country the way the Iraqis have.","Hey, I'm not a politician. I'm a ham. I love to give speeches.","Carpet bombing tends to portray something that's totally indiscriminate, you know, en masse without regard to the target.","I've got to tell you what, the soldier doesn't fight very hard for a leader who is going to shoot him, okay, on his own whim. That's not what military leadership is all about.","Someone once asked, 'What is the difference between me and Saddam Hussein?' The answer is, 'I have a conscience and he doesn't.'"],"Norman Spinrad":["It's trite to say that the world has gotten smaller in the age of globalization, but my travels have told me that it's wrong to think this means there is some kind of uniform world culture.","As a child, I read science fiction, but from the very beginnings of my reading for pleasure, I read a lot of non-fictional history, particularly historical biography.","English is taking over the world. I just wrote a piece about it. And it's not by design. The United States dominates because it's the biggest market.","I believe that interest in heroes is universal and eternal.","I get work because I'm primarily a novelist but I've become script doctor. I can work back and forth between French and English.","I must admit to being greatly influenced by Joseph Campbell's The Hero With a Thousand Faces.","I never learned to read music.","I was a precocious reader.","I write in American slang.","I'm not gifted, but I'm not hopeless.","I've always been interested in the relationship between total external surround, culture, the political matrix, technology, etc., and the internal human consciousness.","If I had parallel lives to pursue, I would also want one as a painter.","If it's not American, the French won't go see it.","In America, if you don't do a 100 million dollars, you've done nothing.","Is anything accidental?","Mexico was conquered more by manipulation of myth and archetype.","The thematic, psychological, and cultural concerns of a writer are more relevant than whatever literary mode he or she chooses to deal with in any given novel.","The world has become more complex as technology and easy travel mixes cultures without homogenizing them.","There are certain things that ordinary people have that celebrities don't have.","When you're in the States and you're a writer and you've got money and you walk into a bank, you're a bum with money.","You can really do more than you think you can do."],"Norman Tebbit":["It is certainly safe, in view of the movement to the right of intellectuals and political thinkers, to pronounce the brain death of socialism.","Parliament must not be told a direct untruth, but it's quite possible to allow them to mislead themselves.","He didn't riot.

McNamara, who is a good businessman and likes to save, says it would be only 200 million.","To us Americans much has been given; of us much is required. With all our faults and mistakes, it is our strength in support of the freedom our forefathers loved which has saved mankind from subjection to totalitarian power.","I walk where I choose to walk.","I always get more applause than votes."],"Norman Vincent Peale":["Change your thoughts and you change your world.","Believe in yourself! Have faith in your abilities! Without a humble but reasonable confidence in your own powers you cannot be successful or happy.","The trouble with most of us is that we would rather be ruined by praise than saved by criticism.","Four things for success: work and pray, think and believe.","Empty pockets never held anyone back. Only empty heads and empty hearts can do that.","Watch your manner of speech if you wish to develop a peaceful state of mind. Start each day by affirming peaceful, contented and happy attitudes and your days will tend to be pleasant and successful.","Action is a great restorer and builder of confidence. Inaction is not only the result, but the cause, of fear. Perhaps the action you take will be successful; perhaps different action or adjustments will have to follow. But any action is better than no action at all.","Every problem has in it the seeds of its own solution. If you don't have any problems, you don't get any seeds.","It's always too early to quit.","Stand up to your obstacles and do something about them. You will find that they haven't half the strength you think they have.","Imagination is the true magic carpet.","Repetition of the same thought or physical action develops into a habit which, repeated frequently enough, becomes an automatic reflex.","Part of the happiness of life consists not in fighting battles, but in avoiding them. A masterly retreat is in itself a victory.","There is a real magic in enthusiasm. It spells the difference between mediocrity and accomplishment.","Promises are like crying babies in a theater, they should be carried out at once.","Drop the idea that you are Atlas carrying the world on your shoulders. The world would go on even without you. Don't take yourself so seriously.","Any fact facing us is not as important as our attitude toward it, for that determines our success or failure. The way you think about a fact may defeat you before you ever do anything about it. You are overcome by the fact because you think you are.","If you put off everything till you're sure of it, you'll never get anything done.","Be interesting, be enthusiastic... and don't talk too much.","We tend to get what we expect.","If you paint in your mind a picture of bright and happy expectations, you put yourself into a condition conducive to your goal.","We struggle with the complexities and avoid the simplicities.","If you have zest and enthusiasm you attract zest and enthusiasm. Life does give back in kind.","Change yourself and your work will seem different.","When you pray for anyone you tend to modify your personal attitude toward him.","We've all heard that we have to learn from our mistakes, but I think it's more important to learn from successes. If you learn only from your mistakes, you are inclined to learn only errors.","The Gateway to Christianity is not through an intricate labyrinth of dogma, but by a simple belief in the person of Christ.","Don't take tomorrow to bed with you.","The life of inner peace, being harmonious and without stress, is the easiest type of existence.","Christmas waves a magic wand over this world, and behold, everything is softer and more beautiful.","Formulate and stamp indelibly on your mind a mental picture of yourself as succeeding. Hold this picture tenaciously. Never permit it to fade. Your mind will seek to develop the picture... Do not build up obstacles in your imagination.","One of the greatest moments in anybody's developing experience is when he no longer tries to hide from himself but determines to get acquainted with himself as he really is.","The more you lose yourself in something bigger than yourself, the more energy you will have.","Getting people to like you is merely the other side of liking them.","It is of practical value to learn to like yourself. Since you must spend so much time with yourself you might as well get some satisfaction out of the relationship.","You will soon break the bow if you keep it always stretched.","When every physical and mental resources is focused, one's power to solve a problem multiplies tremendously.","Understanding can overcome any situation, however mysterious or insurmountable it may appear to be."],"Norman Wisdom":["I was born in very sorry circumstances. Both of my parents were very sorry.","I've done seven shows at the Palladium - long running shows I'm talking about.","You know I've got a chum, a smashing mate, he's got a dog with no legs, and he calls it a cigarette. It's true, yeah, because at nighttime he has to take it out for a drag.","As you get older three things happen. The first is your memory goes, and I can't remember the other two.","I like consistency. If you've had a childhood like mine, you want some things you can rely on to stay the same.","I was in the band as a boy and was taught music and learned to compose.","I'm still constantly thinking of ideas. I don't feel 90. I think I'm about 12.","I have a folder where I keep all the articles the critics have written about me. It makes me feel good.","But no, I've just been very lucky. But I've worked hard, and the harder you work, the luckier you seem to get.","I do play drums when I'm on tour.","I owe everything to the army.","I play drums, clarinet, saxophone, trumpet, french horn, piano.","I was born in London, and went to school in Scotland - I used to be dead tired when I got home at night.","I've an idea for doing a Situation Comedy myself but its always difficult to get people to listen to you because they like to put their own ideas forward.","I've been extremely lucky having been in the army when I was a boy of fourteen.","I've got one idea I want to do for a film and you know I just enjoy myself doing bits and pieces.","In fact, one was so booked out we went from March and were to go till November, but the pantomime was booked so they transferred the show to the Prince of Wales Theatre because it was so packed out, and it ran on from there.","Of course I've done musicals here in London.","Well if I was going to describe my audience, it's going to take longer than you'd ever expect, hundreds of years in fact, because there's many of them, all over the world.","At my age, the radiation will probably do me good.","Such is life and life is such and after all it isn't much. First a cradle. Then a hearse. It might have been better, but it could have been worse.","I've always had a sense of humour, and I still do, so I just want to go on performing as long as I can. It's as simple as that.","I don't know nothing about communism. But I know the Albanians loved me. Same reason as anyone else loves me. Because I made them laugh.","All my boyhood, all I ever wanted was to be loved.","I used to first go on to entertain an audience. But now I go, and this is really true - I go on to have fun with a crowd of my chums.","I can never tell a joke, I've always found it easier to just fall over.","It was smashing working with Jerry Desmonde, he was a very nice chap.","It was absolutely thrilling to meet Laurel and Hardy, they were so nice.","There are people who like just ordinary comedy fun, and making mistakes - which I do easily - and then there are people who like the falling over.","You see I'm semi-retired now and don't work all the time, only most of it!","My comedy is for children from three to 93. You do need a slightly childish sense of humour and if you haven't got that, it's very sad.","My father used to be away for months at a time, and he'd never leave any money for food, so my brother and I had to go out and nick it.","When you're as famous as I am, stories take on a life of their own.","I believe in physical comedy, because that reaches out most to people.","Years ago, there was a variety theatre in every British town, and people paid to go down and see it. Comedy was the main part of the theatre, and comedians earned a living by being funny. Now you have comedy in television instead. Comedians now have to be funny within a play.","What I like doing most is making children laugh.","My only phobia is untidiness. My hair has to be neatly kept; my shoes are always clean. Everything has to be in a straight line, in its place.","Most of my comedies were low on budgets - certainly by American standards.","Don't get me wrong: I'm overjoyed with my career to date. But perhaps I could have done more. Mostly, I just did whatever the directors told me to do.","I must admit I like to muck around a bit; I always have.","I've been making people laugh for 40 years, so I know how important it is!"],"Normani Kordei":["Dancing is more than just moving body parts; it is a pathway of expressing your deepest inner thoughts.","It's important to stand up to all forms of bullying, and it's even more important for those who are around you to be just as courageous and stand with you!","One thing I look forward to is seeing new places and new people.","I think that it's just about balance, keeping myself centered, and being happy and healthy.","I've been through so much, especially coming from New Orleans where there was Hurricane Katrina in 2005. I had to pick up. We had to move, make new friends, and I think my family was just strong for me as well because we had to start completely over again.","It's all about believing in yourself and knowing your worth and being optimistic and really just loving yourself for who you are.","I feel I'm most beautiful when I have less makeup on and I'm at home with people surrounding me that support me, and I know they will never judge me or try to change me.","Each and every one of us is amazing in our own way. We have five beautiful women who exude talent, and I am blessed and honored to be one of those women. For me, the bottom line is it's all about respect and love, and I have both for Fifth Harmony.","Together, we can put an end to the hate and promote only positivity and love.","Society tends to pin women against each other, but we need to treat each other with kindness and compliment one another instead.

My dad doesn't look like what you might call the 'safe' African-American male that America would accept, if you know what I mean.","I think there's a contrast between being vulnerable and, you know, 'Girl Power!' I think it's important to have that balance because you don't have to be strong all the time.","I think that a lot of the time, we get in our own heads and make up what other people are thinking, but no one actually cares about the thing you think they care about. You just gotta take that weight off your shoulders and be nice to yourself and be yourself. People will fall in love with who that is.","It's hard for me to believe that the KKK still exists, especially knowing all my ancestors have been through. I feel like the history and meaning of all we have been through has been trashed.","I remember seeing my father shaving my mother's head in the bathroom after her chemo treatments; It was so traumatizing.","Cancer has touched my life and the lives of those I love, and now I'm ready to help all that I can in the fight.","When I get on stage, Beyonce is my alter ego. The way that she's Beyonce in real life and then Sasha Fierce on stage, I'm Normani in real life, and then I pretend to be Beyonce on stage. I just love that she's constantly reinventing herself but stays true to who she is as a person - and she wears so many hats in her life.","People think that celebrities are this untouchable thing, and they forget that we're people with emotions and feelings. They don't realize that it affects us when they comment on pictures on Instagram or Twitter, saying mean things, just as it would affect anybody.","I grew up dancing, so that was always my first dream. But I also have a passion for acting. I would love to step inside of a character and be somebody that I'm not, because I feel like it just gives me an outlet to express myself without being me.","I think it's all about people loving each other and having compassion, accepting one another and educating themselves.","It's impossible for five people to have the exact same ambitions all around.","Any relationship has its strengths and weakness.","The way I see it, my blood, sweat, and tears are not just for me; it's for Fifth Harmony as well. We have been blessed. Most groups have lead singers, but we don't.","You can't allow someone's hate to dictate your life.","Knowing that you're not alone really does make all the difference in the world.","For me, beauty really does come from within, and that may sound cliche, but it's true.","Honestly, you cannot go wrong with being yourself.","I'm originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, and I just feel like it's something that always been inside of me.","I remember being young in the backseat when my grandma would take me to school, and I would be literally singing and belting out Tina Turner at 3 years old.","There's always room for growth. I feel like I'll never get to the point where I'm 100 percent happy with where I am with my career.","I was inspired by Solange's album, 'A Seat At The Table,' from the moment that I heard it. She has clearly taken the time to create a unique body of work and emote through her music from a true place.","I kind of have to take pieces of myself to fit what it is that radio wants.","I hate the fact that people can judge based on something that isn't fully given to them. Like, this isn't the full product.","It's really important to look at yourself in the mirror and have a conversation. Tell yourself you're beautiful every single day. Even if you're not feeling that great in an outfit, but you like how your hair looks, focus on that.","The only person holding you back is you.","What I normally do before going on stage is pray - normally we do a group prayer with the crew or whoever is around, like our security guard, our tour manager and whoever else is back there and wants to pray with us.","Confidence does not come easy, that's for sure.","I really love scary movies, so I'm all about Halloween.","I love Aaliyah, I love Brandy, I love Monica.","Destiny's Child I grew up on hard core. Like, I can't tell you how much I love the three of them so much and what they had to offer.","After Fifth Harmony succeeds to the fullest of its capacity, one day we can go off and do our individual things.","I love how full my lips are.","I know you can do anything you put your mind to and the exterior doesn't matter.","I love how confident she is, plus we also come from the same hometown, Houston, Texas. Her name is Beyonce Knowles. I love her so, so, so much. I love how hard she works.","Being a woman of color, I can truthfully state that I don't feel safe around those who are sworn to honor and uphold the law.","I shouldn't have to worry any time my father walks outside the front door of our home.","Fifth Harmony is its own entity.","I started off in dance. That was actually my first passion, which introduced me to music, which people don't really know.","I was that kid that did dance, singing, pageants. I did everything pretty much across the board, so it was kind of an adjustment solely doing music.","My mom was actually diagnosed with breast cancer when I was five.","I love apple sauce. I have an addiction - I don't know what it is, but I just love the texture of it. It reminds me of baby food. Not that I like to eat baby food.","Ever since I was little, I looked up to Destiny's Child so much; I looked up to the Spice Girls and En Vogue. A piece of me wanted to be in a girl group.","I am so honored to be working with A Place Called Home as their ambassador to bring awareness to the incredible services and programs which benefits kids in the Los Angeles community.","Unfortunately, there is a lot of abuse and negativity online.","No one has the right to make where you go or what you do uncomfortable.","I put my all into performing so people can walk away knowing a bit more about me and feel the passion in my story.","I used to be really nervous to perform in front of people. I would cry.","I love Alicia Keys, Chris Brown, Usher, Mariah Carey... all that stuff.","We performed at the VMAs, which is crazy because we grew up watching that show and all of our inspirations and idols were there."],"Norodom Sihamoni":["I will devote my body and soul to the service of the people and the nation.","I will always stay close to all compatriots, and share together the happiness and suffering.","In all my life and in the future, I will always be a faithful and loyal servant to all of my compatriots."],"Norodom Sihanouk":["Time will inevitably uncover dishonesty and lies; history has no place for them.","John Foster Dulles had called on me in his capacity as Secretary of State, and he had exhausted every argument to persuade me to place Cambodia under the protection of the South East Asia Treaty Organization.","Cambodia wanted no part of SEATO. We would look after ourselves as neutrals and Buddhists."],"Northrop Frye":["The most technologically efficient machine that man has ever invented is the book.","Advertising - a judicious mixture of flattery and threats.","The metaphor of the king as the shepherd of his people goes back to ancient Egypt. Perhaps the use of this particular convention is due to the fact that, being stupid, affectionate, gregarious, and easily stampeded, the societies formed by sheep are most like human ones.","In our day the conventional element in literature is elaborately disguised by a law of copyright pretending that every work of art is an invention distinctive enough to be patented.","The pursuit of beauty is much more dangerous nonsense than the pursuit of truth or goodness, because it affords a stronger temptation to the ego.","Americans like to make money; Canadians like to audit it. I know no other country where accountants have a higher social and moral status.","Just as a new scientific discovery manifests something that was already latent in the order of nature, and at the same time is logically related to the total structure of the existing science, so the new poem manifests something that was already latent in the order of words.","Culture's essential service to a religion is to destroy intellectual idolatry, the recurrent tendency in religion to replace the object of its worship with its present understanding and forms of approach to that object.","It is of the essence of imaginative culture that it transcends the limits both of the naturally possible and of the morally acceptable."],"Norton Juster":["A good book written for children can be read by adults.","I think really good books can be read by anybody.","I write best in the morning, and I can only write for about half a day, that's about it.","One of the problems you have when you read with kids is that once they like something they want you to read it a hundred times.","People always ask about my influences, and they cite a bunch of people I've never heard of.","There are good books and there are bad books, period, that's the distinction.","When you're very young and you learn something - a fact, a piece of information, whatever - it doesn't connect to anything.","I think kids slowly begin to realize that what they're learning relates to other things they know. Then learning starts to get more and more exciting.","The only other thing which I think is important is: Don't write a book or start a book with the expectation of communicating a message in a very important way.","And when I'm writing, I write a lot anyway. I might write pages and pages of conversation between characters that don't necessarily end up in the book, or in the story I'm working on, because they're simply my way of getting to know the characters.","But I find the best things I do, I do when I'm trying to avoid doing something else I'm supposed to be doing. You know, you're working on something. You get bugged, or you lose your enthusiasm or something. So you turn to something else with an absolute vengeance.","I received a grant from The Ford Foundation to write a book for kids about urban perception, or how people experience cities, but I kept putting off writing it. Instead I started to write what became The Phantom Tollbooth.","I remember when I was a kid in school and teachers would explain things to me about what I read, and I'd think, Where did they get that? I didn't read that in there. Later you look at it and think, That's kind of an interesting idea.","It was really written as most, I think, books are by writers - for themselves. There was something that just had to be written, in a way that it had to be written. If you know what I mean."],"Norton Simon":["Well, darling, you can have your tearoom now.","If the picture speaks to me, if it tells me something about myself, then I want it. Then I have to have it.","I liked money more than going to school.","These are the people who are going to see the pictures in my museum.","All right, I will read what's in my pocket.","To me, such functions are like supermarket openings."],"Nostradamus":["The inflated imitations of gold and silver, which after the rapture are thrown into the fire, all is exhausted and dissipated by the debt. All scrips and bonds are wiped out. At the fourth pillar dedicated to Saturn, split by earthquake and flood: vexing everyone, an urn of gold is found and then restored.","From the depths of the West of Europe, a young child will be born of poor people, he who by his tongue will seduce a great troop; his fame will increase towards the realm of the East.","Sooner and later you will see great changes made, dreadful horrors and vengeances. For as the Moon is thus led by its angel, the heavens draw near to the Balance.","In the third month, the sun rising, the Boar and the Leopard on the field of Mars to fight; The tired Leopard raises its eye to the heavens, sees an eagle playing around the sun.","For a long time, I have been making many predictions, far in advance, of events since come to pass, naming the particular locality. I acknowledge all to have been accomplished through divine power and inspiration.","I find by my calculations, which are according to revealed inspiration, that the sword of death is now approaching us, in the shape of pestilence, war more horrible than has been known in three lifetimes, and famine.","Indeed, the hereditary gift of prophecy will go to the grave with me.","In England, one without a trace of Royalty will master. Twenty months he will rule; twenty months he will bleed the lands, then his end comes quickly.","Because of the vulgar advent, I decided to give way and, by dark and cryptic sentences, tell of the causes of the future mutation of mankind; especially the most urgent ones, and the ones I perceived, and in a manner that would not upset their fragile sentiments.","A greater persecution shall befall the Christian Church than has ever been in Africa, and will last until the year 1792, when there will be a revision of centuries.","The Antichrist will be the infernal prince again for the third and last time... so many evils shall be committed by the means of Satan, the infernal Prince, that almost the entire world shall be found undone and desolate.

An alien force will sack a great country. Allies will cross the mountains and the borders.","Pasteur will be celebrated almost as a God-like figure. This is when the moon completes her great cycle, but by other rumors, he shall be dishonored.","That which neither weapon nor flame could accomplish will be achieved by a sweet speaking tongue in council.","Near the gates and within two cities there will be scourges the like of which was never seen: famine within plague, people put out by steel, crying to the great immortal God for relief.","The great earthquake shall be in the month of May; Saturn, Capricorn, Jupiter, Mercury in Taurus; Venus, also Cancer, Mars in zero.","At forty-five degrees, the sky will burn. Fire to approach the great new city; in an instant, a great scattered flame will leap up, when one will want to get evidence from the Normans.","One whom the infernal gods of Hannibal will cause to be reborn, terror of mankind; never more horror nor worse days in the past than will come to the Romans through Babel.","Through the feigned fury of divine emotion, the wife of the great one will be badly wronged. Judges, wishing to condemn such a doctrine, the victim will be sacrificed to the ignorant people.","The perfect knowledge of events cannot be acquired without divine inspiration, since all prophetic inspiration receives its prime motivating force from God the creator, then from good fortune and nature.","Five and forty steps the sky will burn. Fire approaching the large new city. Instantly a great thin flame will leap, when someone will want to test the Normans.","The year 1999, seventh month, from the sky will come a great King of Terror.

A new peace is made; holy laws deteriorate. Paris has never before found herself in such dire straits.","The army of the sea shall stand before the city, then shall go away for a passage that shall not be very long, as a great prey of citizens shall be holding the ground. The fleet returns. The great emblem recovered.","The present time, together with the past, shall be judged by a great jovialist.","In Germany, a new sect shall be born which shall renew ancient pagan times.","Despite all the silver of Diana and Mercury, their images will be found on the lake. For the sculptor looking for new clay, he and his people will be flooded with gold.","A common soldier will make an empire, but he will eventually meet his fate and be condemned to the Great Rock.","A great stench will come from Lausanne, but they will not know its origin; they will put out all people from distant places, fire seen in the sky, a foreign nation defeated.","The great empire will be torn from limb, the all-powerful one for more than four-hundred years: Great power given to the dark one from slaves come.","There will be a great loss of learning before the moon's full cycle is completed. Fire and floods will be fomented by ignorant rulers; much time will go by before it is rectified.","Born in poverty, he will take supreme power. He will bankrupt the country. Raising an army in the Milanese marches, he will drain Faenza and Florence of gold and people.","The religion of the name of the seas will triumph against the sect of the son of Adaluncatif; The obstinate, lamented sect will be fearful of the two wounded by Aleph and Aleph.","A soldier of fortune with twisted tongue will come to pillage the sanctuary of the gods; To the heretics he will open the gate, thus stirring up the Church militant.","It is the circuit of the great ruinous deed when the name of the seventh is that of the fifth; when the third, even greater, the warlike stranger will take Paris, nor will Provence save her.","A great war shall burst forth from fishes of steel. Machines of flying fire, lobsters, grasshoppers, mosquitoes.

The ancient Lady will fall from her high place, and many of the same sect will be killed."],"Noureen DeWulf":["One of my personal indulgences is getting a weekly massage - it helps to re-align my body. I usually feel so much less tense after I've gotten rid of some knots in my shoulders and back.","Yoga is the most boring exercise. It's for people who are too lazy to get on the elliptical. Bikram, where they heat up the room to mimic India's climate, is especially stupid. People in India are not skinny because they're doing yoga in 105-degree rooms; they're skinny because there's no food.","I love my heritage both as someone who grew up as a Muslim and as an Indian - it's part of who I am and I would never deny it.","My go-to drink is a mix of cukes, kale, apple and other healthy stuff.","I like to make sure I get enough rest, so I don't make it a priority to go out late night.","Even in comedy it's important to get your body acquainted with what you're going to do.","Friends always ask me what the best Indian restaurant in L.A. is. I'm like, 'I don't know, dude. I have an app on my iPhone for that.'","I put a lot of pressure to keep working. And when I'm not working, my agent books three auditions a day. I'd rather go to the set and work.","It is challenging and hard not to accept all stereotypical roles that get thrown your way. For me, I've been really, really lucky because I have been able to play a lot of different parts.","Ironically, it was because I was raised as a Muslim in the South, that I realised the value in being true to who you really are. I've just got so many things going on inside. I don't know how to resolve all of them other than being true to who I am.","I was in more of the artsy crowd in high school.","I'm used to always being different, in any context. People always want to know how I grew up, so I just say I grew up Muslim. That's the truth. Two Muslim girls can write me two extremely different letters - and they do. Some are very supportive, and some question what I do.","I recently have gotten into juicing as an in-between-meals snack. I think the more vegetable ingredients the better, especially if they are green. I find that a good juice can really curb my appetite when I need to wait for the next meal.","Sometimes I go through a yoga phase or a spinning phase, but I try to vary my workouts so my body doesn't get used to any one thing.","I really enjoy Martin Sheen - he is very unexpectedly funny, very quick.","I think it's great when dramatic actors do lighter, funny roles."],"Nouriel Roubini":["I'm a rock star among geeks, wonks, and nerds.","What we need to understand is, one, that there are market failures; and two, that there are things like asset bubbles and irrational exuberance.

Why is anyone surprised that I am human? Like many New Yorkers, I have a multifaceted life.","If you worry about financial Armageddon, it is indeed metaphorically the time to stock your bunker with guns, ammunition, canned food and gold bars.","Once you run current-account deficits, you depend on the kindness of strangers. This might be the beginning of the end of the American empire.","For me, geopolitical issues are becoming more important, because how can you understand economy if you don't understand geopolitics? People think economists just deal with spreadsheets and charts. That's a narrow-minded caricature.","I don't personally consider myself Dr. Doom. I call myself Dr. Realist, even though it's less exciting and more boring than being called Dr. Doom. If you are consistently saying 'the world is going to end,' who is going to listen to you?","I believe, unlike people that are totally free-market, laissez-faire fundamentalists, that there is an important role that the government can play - one, in providing public goods, whether it's education, health care, or other things, and two, supervising countercyclical policy - stimulus, whether it's monetary, fiscal, or otherwise.","My family is a Jewish Iranian family, but I was born in Turkey and raised in Italy. So it's a very mixed background.","I think it's true that the 1 Percent or the elite are living in a world of, maybe, excessive privilege, and they don't fully realize how much pain and suffering, how much anxiety exists out there.","Having spent 10 years studying emerging markets, I know that you have patterns repeated over and over again. A bubble is like a fire which needs oxygen to continue... when you see there is no oxygen, things change.","What is important to me is that when I write something, people listen to me. I provide my wisdom to people, whether they agree or not.","Celebrity has become a burden. There are more demands on your time. People think it is glamorous to fly places. But it is not - even if you travel business class and stay in wonderful hotels, you end 10,000 miles away from home.","In an extreme credit crunch, leveraged purchases of gold cause forced sales, because any price correction triggers margin calls. As a result, gold can be very volatile - upward and downward - at the peak of a crisis.","A currency serves three functions: providing a means of payment, a unit of account and a store of value. Gold may be a store of value for wealth, but it is not a means of payment. You cannot pay for your groceries with it. Nor is it a unit of account. Prices of goods and services, and of financial assets, are not denominated in gold terms.","If we didn't have greed, market economies wouldn't be as innovative as they are. But in my view, greed has to be contained by the fear of losses, so there has to be a system where, if you take too much risk, you go into bankruptcy. You don't systematically bail out people who take excessive risks.","I've nothing against Goldman Sachs. But Goldman Sachs isn't an investment bank. Goldman Sachs is a hedge fund. It's bigger than any hedge fund. It's more leveraged, to the power of three or five, than any hedge fund.","No country can be complacent in making sure that excessive debt of the household doesn't create excesses and weaknesses in the financial system. Everything is interconnected.","A home is a home, and excess supply leads to prices falling.","The U.S. has been living in a situation of excesses for too long. Consumers were out spending more than their income and the country was spending more than its income, running up large current-account deficits. Now we have to tighten our belts and save more.","I love and collect contemporary art and go to all the art fairs. I love Damien Hirst and Matthew Barney. I grew up in Italy and had a humanistic education in philosophy and literature - things I love and appreciate. People are richer and more complex than just their day-to-day professional pursuits might suggest.","I believe investors should invest for the long run, so I don't buy and sell. I usually maintain the classic index of global equities, diversified U.S. and global and emerging markets, and when the risk is larger, I diminish the amount in global equities and put more into liquid assets - but very irregularly.","Among the social media - I've tried them all - Facebook is a bit of a game, but Twitter is a productivity tool. I use it regularly and I'm addicted to it.","The economic costs, the financial costs, the job losses, the income losses, the fiscal costs of bailing out financial system are becoming larger and larger.","The trouble is that the average trader on Wall Street, he or she is so young, he doesn't even remember the recession of 2001, let alone the previous one.","I am quite international. My background, born in Turkey. My family is a Jewish family from Iran, so I went from Turkey to Iran to Israel, and then grew up in Italy and ended up in U.S. for graduate school. So I tend to look at things from an international perspective, and I think that gives you a little bit of a broader view of what's going on.","The global financial crisis - missed by most analysts - shows that most forecasters are poor at pricing in economic/financial risks, let alone geopolitical ones.","I'm not a pessimist by nature. I'm not someone who sees things in a bleak way.","I have more concerns about potential risks and vulnerabilities than most people."],"Novak Djokovic":["I'm a happy man, because I am successful in what I do, of course; but what makes me most happy is I have people around me that I love and who love me back. This, for me, is the most important thing. Nobody likes to be alone.","Building a solid foundation in the early years of a child's life will not only help him or her reach their reach their full potential but will also result in better societies as a whole.","In my case, I can sincerely say that nothing is impossible... When I was saying I want to be No. 1 of the world, and I was seven or eight years old, most of the people were laughing at me because it seems like I have one percent of chances to do that, and I've done it.","In terms of playing ability there is nothing to choose between number one and 100. Instead, it's a question of who believes and who wants it more? Which player is mentally stronger? Which player is going to fight the hardest in the big points? These are the things that determine who is the champion.","Joking around is part of my personality, just who I am.","Tennis is a mental game. Everyone is fit, everyone hits great forehands and backhands.","It gives me goose bumps and little butterflies in the stomach when I start thinking about the 'golden slam.'","I love being around people who care about me, and I care about them.","I always try to have something that keeps my mind relaxed, keeps my mind a little bit off tennis.","Imagine a part of the U.S.A., from which the U.S.A. started - where is the cradle of your history? This is Kosovo for Serbia.","I like my groundstrokes, I can say. I like it. That's my game - I'm a groundstroke player and I play pretty aggressive.","I want the same thing I've wanted since I was 7 years old. I want to be No. 1.","We have a harder way to succeed in life as Serbs because of the past that we had and because of the history we had.","I am very skinny.","I had to listen to the classical music because it calms me down, calms my nerves down.","I feel the pressure.","I'm happy, my family's happy, everything is going well.","I'm trying not to pay too much attention to the rankings because calculations can distract you.","As a kid I was creative.","Tennis players we're always playing in center courts that feel like arenas. And when we get on the court and the crowd cheers your name or salutes you - it's like you're a gladiator in the arena. And everyone is cheering - and you're fighting, you're screaming, during your strokes - it feels like you're an animal, fighting for your life.","I embraced, I think, the process of becoming No. 1 of the world, which was long and difficult, but it's sweeter in the end.","I had to know at least two languages.","Even though now I'm pretty popular in my country and tennis is the No. 1 sport, and I'm very flattered that the people recognise me and come up and give me compliments, I'm more a person who likes to have privacy and peace.","I'm trying to enjoy my lie as much as I can and I know that tennis hopefully is going to be my life the next 10, 15 years.","Not everybody can like what I do, and if you feel that somebody is coming up closer to you and starting the rivalry and everything, you maybe change your position to him.","My mother is a special story. She went through so much to bring us up, four men at home, especially when our country was going through really difficult times.","I am fast and very powerful on the court, so this is what matters.","Serbian history tells that the family is the most important thing and you have to stick with the family.","The history of our country is cruel. We have to face those issues or, should I say, we had to. Not anymore I hope, because we are going in the right direction, and we are ready to forgive, ready to move on.","It's interesting that I had such a close relationship with my grandfather. Because your parents always judge you: they say, 'You shouldn't do this, you shouldn't do that.' But with your grandparents you have a feeling that you can say anything or you can do anything, and they will support you. That's why you have this kind of connection.","My grandfather went through a lot in his life.","It's always easier if you have the support of your family, if you're not alone. I came from a country that has been through a lot of troubles in the last 20 to 30 years, but we have been through them together.","My father had never watched tennis, never liked tennis too much. He said, 'OK, we buy a racket, we watch together,' because we didn't know anything. It was a process of learning together that made it more interesting.","The confidence is there, the game is there, but physically you can't fight nature sometimes. You can't do much about it.","You have to consistently be successful to be one of the top players in the world, and everything is possible in life.","I've had my ups and downs in my private life.","Mostly the problems when I was down were caused by myself. There were times when I was not responsible enough or decisive enough.","It was very unusual for a boy to play tennis in my country.","The tradition in Serbia has always been team sports - football, basketball, handball, volleyball and water polo, individual sports are not supported.","My father never talked about the sacrifices that the family made for me.","In order to stay where I am - and I want to do that - I have to stay dedicated as well as I have been before I became No. 1.","I always try to adjust to the situation.","Well, I do feel that I carry the responsibility of representing my country wherever I am, and this responsibility came with the success that I had in last couple of years, not just myself but the whole group of tennis players that comes from Serbia. And athletes in general are, in this moment, the biggest ambassadors that our country has.","Tennis is my life, obviously; I need to focus, I need to win. But it's not the only thing. I'm not going to play forever.","I never wanted to change countries; it's something that is part of me.","I love football and it's the sport I would really like to play. I've said on national television here that I would really love to play for one of our football clubs when I finished my tennis career.","Nobody actually played tennis in my family.","I always tried to win. I was as competitive as I am today.","I don't think there has been enough communication between the players and the tournaments. In one sense it's just as much the players' fault. Players talk between each other and in the locker room about things that can be improved and then when the time comes to talk and really do something about it they stop.","I haven't been in tennis for that long, but what I can say is that we have a lot of young guys at the top who are willing to do a lot of good things for tennis in general.","My nutritionist has done a great job in changing my diet after we established I am allergic to things like gluten - I can't eat pizza, pasta and bread. I have lost some weight, but my movement is sharper and I feel great.","I want to help children in Serbia and around the world so they can realize their dreams.","All children have rights and those rights must be protected.","What I learned as a young child continues to have a tremendous impact on my life today.","I had a unique privilege to have a good start in life and a chance to develop my talents.","Those born into poverty or on the margins of society require our extra support to realize their dreams.","I think luck falls on not just the brave but also the ones who believe they belong there.","I stopped thinking too much about what could happen and relied on my physical and mental strength to play the right shots at the right time.","People look up to me as somebody who is able to switch the image of our country from negative to positive.","I have been through two wars in my 24 years, and I know what it's like to be without anything, to see the bombs flying above your head.","I cannot guarantee anything.","Honestly, I'm not a big fan of baseball.","And when I was saying I want to become number one of the world and I was 7, 8 years old, most of the people were laughing to me. Because you know, it seemed like I have one percent chances to do that. And I've done it.","But, it's because we have a harder way to succeed in life as Serbs because of the past that we had and because of the history that we had. We have to dig deeper and we have to do much more in order to be seen and to be spotted."],"Novala Takemoto":["There are so many awful things in this world, but I wanted readers to share with me the small, beautiful, enjoyable things. Things like cute clothes, beautiful art and pretty flowers; items that are overflowing with beauty. If you just become obsessed with your own problems, you miss these things. When you discover them, you become happy.","I know that many people kill off their real personality just to fit into this society, but why do we have to compromise? I never understood that. I decided to try to be myself and to live by my own values rather than those of others.","When I started writing, I thought nobody would understand the things that I liked. Then I began getting a lot of letters from people who said they were waiting for me to express what they felt they couldn't, so I kept writing."],"Novalis":["Learning is pleasurable but doing is the height of enjoyment.","A hero is one who knows how to hang on one minute longer.","Only as far as a man is happily married to himself is he fit for married life and family life in general.","Only an artist can interpret the meaning of life.","Knowledge is only one half. Faith is the other.","Every beloved object is the center point of a paradise.","We are more closely connected to the invisible than to the visible.","To become properly acquainted with a truth, we must first have disbelieved it, and disputed against it.","Poetry heals the wounds inflicted by reason.","A character is a completely fashioned will.","The artist belongs to his work, not the work to the artist.","Where children are, there is the golden age.","We are near waking when we dream we are dreaming.","Philosophy is properly home-sickness; the wish to be everywhere at home.","Where no gods are, spectres rule.","We never completely comprehend ourselves, but we can do far more than comprehend.","Nothing is more indispensable to true religiosity than a mediator that links us with divinity.","Christianity is the root of all democracy, the highest fact in the rights of men.","Character and fate are two words for the same thing.","Nature is a petrified magic city.","I often feel, and ever more deeply I realize, that fate and character are the same conception."],"Ntozake Shange":["I write for young girls of color, for girls who don't even exist yet, so that there is something there for them when they arrive. I can only change how they live, not how they think.","I'm a firm believer that language and how we use language determines how we act, and how we act then determines our lives and other people's lives.","I started writing because there's an absence of things I was familiar with or that I dreamed about. One of my senses of anger is related to this vacancy - a yearning I had as a teenager... and when I get ready to write, I think I'm trying to fill that.","Multiculturalism is a white people joke.","Multiculturalism isn't about culture, it's about power.","If anything is life-changing, being the descendant of a slave is.","White people use their literature to maintain culture. That's why you find references to Milton and Spencer and Shakespeare and Dostoyevsky in contemporary novels."],"Nuno Bettencourt":["Having a baby is one of the most wonderful things in your life, as well as the hardest thing in your life.","Live are a really good band. I like Stone Temple Pilots, Radiohead I love. Even Oasis.","I am affected by what is around. I don't think many people would admit that.","Who needs fan mail when you have the Internet?","When you are in this business and this career, it's hard for any one thing to engulf you.","There's two facets to writing a song. There's you sitting in your room writing the sentiments of the song; the lyrics, the melody and the changes, and then there's the part where you go into the studio and you put clothing on it.","The touring part is really mixed. You love to play and you can't wait to go, but you don't want to leave.","Obviously the biggest change is that it's me by myself. When you don't have another band interpreting your songs or playing them the way that they have, it's bound to sound different.","My current project is my band, Population 1. We are writing, rehearsing and playing in Los Angeles.","It's just a bunch of songs. I'm not trying to cure any major disease.","It's hard to know exactly what it sounds like to me. I'm in the studio and I write it. and that's it.","I wanted to do the whole album in black and white, and it really killed me that when you see it in the light it's got green in it.

There's a lot of older influences, but there's also newer stuff too.","I always imagine later on these songs I could've played with a band, but it never worked out that way.","Half the bands I guarantee wouldn't at this point want Nuno to open for them.","Even with Extreme, I don't think you have a choice but to sort of have somewhat of an influence of the times.","As opposed to touring for three years and then going into the studio and writing an album, I think this record is representative of a lot of everyday people.","As much as you put into it is as much as you get out of it.","A band is like a marriage - you don't know why it works, but when it does, everything feels right."],"Nursultan Nazarbayev":["We must strive to encourage East and West not only to move towards each other but also to encourage them to find a new philosophy, a philosophy which will serve as a tool determining the future of Planet Earth - our common and only shelter.","North Eurasia is one of the best examples of religious tolerance and peaceful coexistence of Islam and Christianity.

I have tried to make the music a bit easier for them to understand.","I am not a Sufi, but I follow the Sufi.","In my opinion, being an all-rounder is good. It is not right that I should be content with qawwali and ignore other forms, since I am basically trained in classical singing. We should be masters of all forms of singing.","Yes, you've got to sing from the depths of the heart.","A man learns all his life and dies the day he thinks that he has learnt everything.","You've got to sing from the depths of the heart. Without heart, you cannot be a Qawwal.","There is a famous musician, Peter Gabriel, who has used my voice in the movie, 'The Last Temptation of Christ.' He used my song in the background.","Yes, I tried to change the classical style in a way that people who don't understand it can enjoy.","When people start dancing, they dance like they don't know they are doing it.","I was just studying with my father, a very difficult task for me since he was a great, great Qawwali singer.","I also like Western classical music and jazz.","I do listen to other music though, and try to pick up what is good.","My father gave me formal education in raagdari. He died in Lahore in 1964 when I was 13. I was in the tenth year of school, and my father's brother took me into the qawwali ensemble and started giving me formal education in qawwali.","People listened to Farsi texts, and to the great texts of our Baba Bulleh Shah, Khwaja Ghulam Farid, Mian Mohammad Bakhsh Jehlmi. People do listen to it these days, but much less than in those days.","From childhood, I had been instructed in the tablaa by my father, along with the astaais and antaraas specific to our Gharana.","There are two languages that I love: Farsi and Panjabi. Because the depth of Sufi thought in these two languages cannot be found in any other language.","There should be change - the West should understand our music and culture, and vice versa. With such collaboration, artists can come closer to each other and come to know each other.","It is not necessary that the scion of a singing family, even if he sings, can excel in it. In order to reach his peak he has to work very, very hard.","I do disagree with the way videos of my songs have been made. 'Afreen Afreen' is a very powerful song; it did not require such a video. The emphasis should be on the song. Again, I have told my recording company, and in the future, they will screen the video only after my approval.","I like to experiment with my voice, besides music.","A performer learns with experience and with age. I did not know the future when I left home and started out to begin my career: I started qawaali; then I met Peter Gabriel and was exposed to a lot of new ideas."],"Nydia Velazquez":["Let me tell you, I am nobody's puppet.","Of course, preserving the American dream has always meant creating opportunity for the most recently arrived Americans - those who have come here from other parts of the globe to work hard and build a new, better life.","For families to access affordable housing, they often need legal representation that takes their side against abusive landlords.","Fair and affordable housing is a basic right for all New Yorkers and all Americans.","There are people out there who don't like me, and that's because I speak out the way I feel.","Asian Pacific American Heritage Month provides us all an opportunity to reflect upon this community's many contributions and to celebrate its bright future.","Too often, the landlord-tenant relationship is unbalanced with all the power on the side of unscrupulous landlords.","Nationally, more than one million Asian American entrepreneurs create jobs in their communities, helping fuel local commerce. In New York, we have seen firsthand how this community has helped drive our economy forward through hard work and ingenuity.","Historically and culturally, New York City and our entire nation simply would not be the same without the infusion of Asian traditions. Whether it is food, art, language or any other facet of cultural life, Asian Americans have made our city and our country stronger and richer.","For small businesses to thrive, they require an environment that is conducive for growth."],"Nyle DiMarco":["My passion, personally, is being my true self while inspiring young people who are struggling with their identities to love themselves for who they are.","We have our own culture, our own community. A lot of people don't realize that. They just assume that deaf people are very unfortunate, very disabled, but no.","I'm fortunate to have blue eyes!","My sexiest feature is my body.","I think the biggest misconception is that people think deaf people are not able to do things.","I'm really excited to educate the world about what deaf people can do.","I have always aspired to be the type of role model who can bridge the deaf and hearing communities.","I am truly humbled. Not only that I am going to be known as the final Top Model but as a final Top Model who is deaf! And that is an amazing tagline. This proves that deaf people can do anything and everything.","Own your identity. Love who you are in the world. Love your deafness.","I'm ready to take the world by storm and have them look at me and say, 'Deaf people can dance.'","My message to my deaf community is that we can redefine anything however we want. Anything is re-definable only if we believe and work hard for it.","When I signed up for 'Dancing with the Stars,' I was nervous. If I threw everything off, there are 10-15 million people watching, and that would be a negative viewpoint of deaf people, and I didn't want that.","I was born deaf. Sound never existed in my life, and this is completely normal to me.","If I'd been born into a hearing family and went to a public school, I would have probably felt much more isolated, and being deaf would have become my identity.","American Sign Language requires a lot of facial and body expression.","I love to cook breakfast. I am a morning person.","I am a visual person, given that I am deaf.","There is research proving that deaf people have increased visual abilities.","Since I knew my deaf identity since birth, it wasn't hard for me to be comfortable, confident, and independent in a hearing world.","I think being deaf gave me an increased sense of sight.","I was doing a little modeling on the side. Then 'ANTM' found me on social media, and it pretty much flipped my life around, all for the better.","As a sexually fluid deaf man, I know that embracing all our identities is the way to thrive and to overcome the limitations and prejudices that surround us.","I feel the need to reframe our community positively and better deaf youth's lives, and with the 'DWTS' platform, I can - but it's not enough until I win.","I would love to work with Mario Testino. I respect all the work he has done and is doing.","I am one hundred percent ready to be a spokesperson for the deaf community.","I never danced growing up.","I feel like I can see the music and can see how the character of the music actually flows. For me, that's music to my eyes.","I've never wanted to hear.","Growing up, I was always involved in the deaf community.","I love working with photographers.","I love it when I surprise photographers that, despite the fact that I am deaf, I am capable of meeting their vision. I love it that I can read their body language and know what they do not like and what they do like.","There are so many deaf kids out there being deprived of their own language.","I grew up with deaf teachers, and I thought all deaf children should have exposure to deaf educators.","I started to realize that there are a lot of people who are unaware of deaf culture, and I've been given a great platform to reframe the deaf community.","I want to use my celebrity for good.","Right after college, I was trying to figure out what to do. Teach? Act? Model? Do PR for the deaf community? And now I'm doing all I dreamed of and more.","I got my mathematics degree because I wanted to teach deaf children math.","It's one of the reasons I want to do 'Dancing with the Stars': it's a platform to educate.","Right before 'ANTM,' I was offered a recurring role for the TV show 'Switched at Birth.' I had to pick one because both of the shows were happening at the same time. I couldn't choose, though, so decided to let my dog Foxy decide. She picked 'ANTM!'","Often in the past, when we have had a deaf person in the spotlight, we have been portrayed badly. It was up to me to change that.","I'm fortunate to be a part of the 'ANTM' family.","I think we really do need deaf people out there writing their own shows.","A relationship isn't a priority of mine but, you know, I'm hoping soon enough.","Seriously, I don't find not being able to hear an obstacle or a boundary. For me, and for many of us, it is an advantage, and it's a part of my identity, in fact. It's a huge part of who I am.","Am I complaining about my deafness? No, I am not.","I work out a lot.","We have over 25 deaf individuals in my family.","My mom did a great job because ever since I was born, she would put me into any type of sporting activity with hearing teams.","In middle school, I had the best math teacher I've ever had, and he was deaf... and I felt inspired by him. I knew from then on that I wanted to be a math teacher.","I had to live with the models in one big house for two months, 24 hours a day. Only a few of them actually learned how to sign... I couldn't really communicate with anybody, and I felt isolated.","I do not like fancy or chain restaurants. I live for local spots.","I am the fourth generation of being deaf.","I have my own foundation, Nyle DiMarco Foundation, and it focuses on bettering deaf youths' lives."]}
