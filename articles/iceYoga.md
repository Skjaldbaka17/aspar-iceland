One can do yoga in many ways. There's Hatha yoga, Kundalini yoga, hot yoga and even snow yoga. But what all yogas have in common is emphasis on breathing and being mindful. The same goes for Icelandic yoga. Icelandic yoga is always practised outside in the nature and the goal is to connect to the nature so you feel like a part of it. Icelandic weather and temperature might not appeal to the normal yoga practitioner for it can be pretty cold here in the North Atlantic. But that doesn't stop the vikings of Iceland to go out in the cold nature to stretch. 
To deal with the cold it is really important to prepare your body before you dive into the yoga positions. The way we prepare our bodies is that we do a certain breathing exercise at the beginning of the yoga session. That exercise gives us enough energy to become one with the cold and make us feel like we belong in the nature. After the breathing exercise we start doing the yoga. Like in all other yogas, Icelandic yoga has its favorit positions which are all designed for cold nature. Most of the positions are standing positions which will help us keep warm during the practise.      
	Some people exercising yoga the Icelandic way prefer exposing the body to the cold rather than covering it with clothes so some of us do it only in our shorts. But don't worry, no one is forced to do yoga almost naked. The main purpose is to feel close to the nature. 
If done right the Icelandic yoga has great benefits for both your physical and mental health. If you're not used to being in cold climate you will be amazed by how much cold your body can take. That experience alone makes you feel empowered and you feel like you can do anything. Another thing Icelandic yoga buts a lot of emphasis on is connection to the nature. In our daily life we often strive for things we want and put our focus on the future. In Icelandic yoga we do the opposite, we make the nature influence us and we stay in the now. By doing that our mind becomes much calmer and happier because we feel like we belong in our environment. We start to work with the environment instead of against it and by working with it we become happier and distressful.
