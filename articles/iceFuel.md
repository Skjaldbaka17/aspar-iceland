We here in Iceland are really proud of our traditional food. When it comes to tasting something truly different than you are used to we are experts. We basically eat everything around here. From sheep‘s head to fermented shark we eat it. What we are really proud of though is our popular skyr. Skyr has been a part of Icelandic cuisine for over a thousand years and due to it‘s protein richness it has served us as a great viking food for ages. Skyr is basically a dairy product which is similar to yogurt but has a milder flavour. Nowadays it comes in many flavours such as vanilla, blueberry and strawberry. Icelanders usually serve it with milk and sugar.

​            The second biggest industry (the biggest is the tourism industry) in Iceland is the fishing industry. For ages Icelanders have been fishing in the North Atlantic ocean and just as before we basically eat everything we get from the ocean. Whale, shark, cod, scallops and sea weed are all things one can see on the Icelandic dinner tables. We have a lot of different ways to serve our seafood. We have boiled haddock, smoked salmon, fermented shark, lamb smoked with sheep-manure and wind-dried fish. Similar to skyr, wind-dried fish as been a part of Icelandic cuisine for ages. It‘s usually cod or haddock and the best way to eat it is simply just put some butter on it first. Also, like skyr, wind-dried fish is rich in protein which has helped us being strong throughout the ages.

​            This text is only a gist of what Icelandic food has to offer. The last thing   I´ll mention is the Icelandic pancakes. The traditional Icelandic pancakes are a delicious dessert. The pancake itself is similar to the French crêpes but in Iceland it is typically served rolled with sugar. Every Icelandic grandma is always ready with pancakes when she expects a visit.
