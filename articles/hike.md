The hike to Iceland´s second highest waterfall, Glymur, starts on a gravel parking lot close to road 47 in the fjord Hvalfjörður. It usually takes about an hour to hike to the top but it all comes down to the speed of the hiker. The 198 meter waterfall is originated from the lake Hvalvatn which is in about 3 kilometers distance from the waterfall. Hvalvatn is one of our deepest lakes (about 160 meters deep) and its name can be translated to the name Whale lake in English. 

​            Hikers must go through a few obsticles before reaching the top. The most demanding one is crossing a river on a tree log which will test your balance. But it‘stotally worth going through because the reward is seeing the beautiful waterfall which is located in a narrow gorge so it can‘t be seen from everywhere. There are only a few places on the trail where you can see it. Overall this is an adventurous hike which has a lot to offer.
