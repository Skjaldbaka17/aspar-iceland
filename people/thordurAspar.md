Þórður, or Thor, has yet to find his rythm in life for he hasn‘t kept a normal job ever. Despite that he is probably the most ambitious runner we have here in Iceland. Seriously, he never stops running. This guy is like Forrest Gump. During the day he‘s either a hiking guide or having fun programming games on his computer. But by night he plays the piano for hours and solves math equations. Thor is the type you really want to get to know better for he has a really interesting personal life. The last thing which Thor is the expert at is Icelandic food. What he really loves doing is blasting Nicki Minaj in the kitchen and cooking traditional Icelandic food. All in all Thor is a friendly dude to talk to and will do anything to make you happy.
