Ever since Daníel was put on this planethe has been searching for Iceland‘s most beautiful place. He hasn‘t yet found it but he‘s constantly on the look out. His passion for Icelandic nature is enormous and he wouldn‘t want to be anywhere else. By day he‘s an Icelandic nature guide but by night he likes talking with his friends about Søren Kierkegaard‘s philosophy about existentialism. In his physical life he does jiu jitsu from time to time and he really likes going to the beach in Reykjavík in the winter. He is also obsessed with living a healthy lifestyle and organised Glymur health and adventure tour. Over all he‘s a fun guy to hang around with and his warm presence won‘t betray you.
